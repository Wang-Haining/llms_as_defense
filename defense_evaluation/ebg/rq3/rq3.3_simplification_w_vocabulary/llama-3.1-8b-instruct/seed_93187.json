            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "This paper talks about two models that help us understand a sleep problem called insomnia. The biological model looks at how genetics and medical reasons can cause insomnia. The sociocultural model looks at how the environment and social factors affect insomnia.\n\nThe biological model says that insomnia can be caused by genetic information and medical problems. The sociocultural model says that environmental factors like race, ethnicity, and economic status can also cause insomnia.\n\nThis paper will look at some research that relates to these two models. We will explain each study and its findings. Then we will talk about the strengths and weaknesses of each study.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep problem. It can be caused by different things. One type of insomnia is a primary sleep disorder. This means that the problem is not caused by another health issue. Another type of insomnia is caused by a mental health problem. There are also sleep disorders that are caused by medical problems or by using a substance.\n\nThe primary sleep disorders are called Dyssonmias or Parasomnias. Dyssonmias are problems with sleeping or staying awake. They include insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and other sleep disorders. Insomnia is when you have trouble sleeping or staying asleep. Hypersomnia is when you have trouble staying awake. Narcolepsy is a condition that makes you fall asleep suddenly.\n\nThe sociocultural model says that insomnia can be caused by social and environmental factors. For example, a person's economic status or age can affect their sleep. Research has shown that people from different cultures and ethnic groups have different sleep patterns.\n\nOne study looked at how genetics affect sleep. The researchers used mice to study the brain's sleep centers. They found that a special type of neuron in the brain helps us sleep and wake up. They also found that a problem with this neuron can cause insomnia. This study suggests that insomnia can be caused by genetic factors.\n\nAnother study looked at how the environment affects sleep. The researchers found that people who live in noisy or stressful environments have more trouble sleeping. This study suggests that sociocultural factors can cause insomnia.\n\nCritics of these studies say that they are too simple. They say that insomnia is caused by many different factors, and we need more research to understand it. Others say that the studies did not look at enough people, so the results may not be generalizable to the whole population.",
            "This paper talks about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It covers three areas: a definition of CAPD, how to diagnose it, and how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a classroom.\n\nCAPD means the brain has trouble using the information we hear. The brain cannot separate sounds or understand speech well in noisy places. People with CAPD can hear normally, but their brain does not work correctly. CAPD is not the same as being deaf or hard of hearing. \n\nCAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Researchers studied children who had trouble communicating. They developed special tests to help identify the problem. In 1977, a national meeting helped researchers learn more about CAPD.\n\nPeople with CAPD have trouble with different things. They may not be able to find where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble hearing two or more sounds at the same time. They may not be able to recognize patterns in sounds. They may not be able to understand changes in speech. Sometimes, one sound can block out another sound. They may not be able to use sounds to make sense of things. They may not be able to tell what order sounds come in.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, a doctor or a specialist uses special tests. These tests look at how the person hears and responds to sounds. There is no one test that works all the time, and we do not know what causes CAPD. Tests may ask the person to listen to many sounds at once and then say what they heard. More advanced tests measure the sounds that go into the ear and the brain's response.\n\nA teacher in a classroom can help a student with CAPD. They can make sure the student sits near the front of the class where it is quieter. They can also ask the student to repeat what the teacher says so they can make sure they understand. The teacher can also help the student use a note-taker or a hearing aid.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says that using a disguise can be helpful in deceiving people. But using a disguise can also cause problems. In the end, a person may have to decide between keeping their true self or keeping relationships with others. Some people may not be angry if they find out they were tricked. But others may be very upset.\n\nThe play talks about a man who dresses as a woman. This makes it a problem because it raises questions. Why does the man want to hide who he is? In the play, the man dresses as a woman to protect himself. He is in a new place and thinks it is safer. He is very good at being a man, but this makes him lose contact with his female friends. It also makes a woman fall in love with him. He also has feelings for another man.\n\nSome people think that using a disguise can help people understand their true feelings. In the play, two people have feelings they do not express. They are able to understand these feelings when they see the man dressed as a woman. But it is not clear if these people really have feelings for the same sex or if they are just pretending.\n\nThe woman in the play is not really in love with the man. She is just pretending to be in love with him. When she meets the man who is the same as the disguised man, she falls in love with him instead. This shows that the woman does not really have feelings for the man. She is just making fun of people who judge others based on how they look.\n\nThe play is about how people can be tricked into understanding their true feelings. But it also shows that using a disguise can cause problems and make it hard for people to keep their relationships with others.",
            "People have talked about German colonial rule being very cruel. One example is the killing of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. However, German colonial rule was complex and had different rules in different places. Education in the colonies was not the same. \n\nWhen the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many educated and able Africans. The German government had done a good job of teaching Africans in some colonies, like Kamerun. \n\nBut the situation in South West Africa was different. The government did not help much with the education of the native people. They mostly left it to Christian groups. The government, on the other hand, educated many German people who lived in the colony. They built schools and controlled the Christian schools. These policies had a big effect on South West Africa even after German rule ended. \n\nMost of the people in South West Africa did not know how to read or write. Some research says this was because of many social, economic, and political problems. This paper wants to look deeper into these problems. It also wants to look at how German settlers and colonial leaders felt about the native people.\n\nThere are many books and studies about education in the German colonies. Most of these were written in German and were published long ago. These studies mainly described how the educational systems worked in the different colonies. Later studies, written in English, compared education in the different colonies and looked at specific parts of the educational systems. One important study is by Cohen. He compared education in South West Africa and East Africa and looked at why their educational systems were different. According to Cohen, the main reason was the large number of Germans living in South West Africa.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but a lot of the land was desert. Many Germans moved there because it was relatively easy to live in. By 1913, there were about 15,000 Germans living in South West Africa. This was a lot more than in East Africa, where there were about 5,300 Germans.",
            "Heavy Metal music is a popular kind of music. It has grown over 100 years. Many people like it because it is very expressive. It shows a lot of emotions, but the emotions are often dark.\n\nHeavy Metal music has many different kinds. Some of these kinds are very different from each other. This makes it hard to say what Heavy Metal music is. It has many ideas from other kinds of music. But Heavy Metal music started from somewhere.\n\nHeavy Metal music is about darkness. It is often loud and has many strong beats. The people who play Heavy Metal music are very good at playing their instruments. They make the music sound very good.\n\nMany people who play Heavy Metal music use drugs to get ideas for their music. A long time ago, there was a time when many people used drugs. This led to some strange and new kinds of music. Some of this music was very dark and scary.\n\nSome of the ideas for Heavy Metal music came from a long time ago. This was a time when artists wrote very emotional music. Many people who play Heavy Metal music today like these old ideas.\n\nThe Beatles were one of the first groups to make Heavy Metal music. They made a song called Helter Skelter. This song is very loud and has a lot of strong beats. It is considered one of the first Heavy Metal songs. The Beatles made it to show that they could make music as loud and heavy as the Rolling Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a famous artist. He painted his dreams. His 1910 painting, The Dream, shows a woman looking at the wonders of a dreamland. It also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals. He wanted to be famous and respected by other artists and art lovers. But he had a problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he also wanted to be creative and different.\n\nTo understand The Dream, you need to know about Rousseau's life. He was born in 1844 in a town in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith. Rousseau did not go to art school. Instead, he worked for the government until he was 40 years old. He then started painting. Painting helped him feel better after his first wife died and his children were born sick. Many artists in France painted peasants in a romantic way. But Rousseau was a folk painter. He painted what he knew from his life.\n\nRousseau wanted to be famous. He started painting when many other artists were already famous. He did not get recognition until many years after other famous artists like Matisse. Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse wanted to paint in a new and interesting way. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that would make him accepted by the art world.",
            "Many great thinkers have said that ethics and beauty are connected. They think that truth and beauty are the same thing. I agree with this idea. As John Keats said, \"Beauty is truth. Truth is beauty. This is all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life through education and experience. But we appreciate beauty and morality without learning about them in school. Both ethics and beauty are about describing things, not telling us what to do. We try to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is right or wrong. But it's hard to fully understand what makes something good or beautiful.\n\nWhen we talk about art, we often discuss things like how it looks or what it means. But these things don't fully explain why it's good. When someone asks about a favorite work of art, they might say, \"There's something special about it.\" They can't fully explain what that is. I think art and morals are the same way. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" We tell stories because words alone are not enough. I think ethics is the same. As Wittgenstein said, \"Ethics can't be explained. Ethics is beyond words.\" I think this \"something special\" is what makes art and morals so powerful.\n\nI believe that ethics and art are connected because they both touch us on a deep level. We experience them in a way that can't be fully understood. This connection is especially strong with literature. Literature is special because it deals with values. As McKean said, \"Literature is important to us because of the values we find there.\" Living involves values, and literature helps us understand those values.",
            "Today's Germany is a strong country. It is a single country with its own culture. This culture comes from the Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. You can also see it in Köln on the Rhine River to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. This unique culture comes from many different groups and tribes.\n\nThe country of Germany has a long history. We do not know for sure how it got its name. Some people think it came from a tribe called the Tungrians. They were called Germans before they moved across the Rhine River and fought against the Gauls.\n\nThe Roman leader Julius Caesar first used the word \"Germanus\" to describe the people he fought against. He took this word from the Gauls. The Gauls used it to describe their neighbors. Caesar wrote about the Germans in his book about the Gallic Wars. He said they lived across the Rhine River and often fought the Gauls.\n\nOther people think the name \"Germany\" came from a spear called a ger. They used this spear in battle. Others think it came from an old word that means \"to shout.\" This was because the Germans were very loud.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in the year 98 AD. He said they were an old group of people who did not mix with other groups. He said they were a difficult group to visit because of their rough land and weather. He also said they had a hard time being friends with the Romans.\n\nThe Germanic tribes lived on the borders of the Roman Empire. They traded goods and skills with the Romans. They also served in the Roman army. This helped them learn from the Romans and improve their own country.",
            "I stared down at the bowl in front of me. My mind was empty and quiet. I was looking at a picture, but I did not think about it much. My mind was like a calm lake. It was looking at the picture, but it was not thinking about it.\n\nI had a book on art once. It was called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" An artist I worked with told me about it. I wanted to learn to draw when I was six years old. The book teaches how to draw. It says to put a frame around the picture you want to draw. This helps you see it more clearly.\n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit on a table. But I was too busy to think about drawing it. I was amazed by the picture. It was too much for me to handle. The artist Picasso liked blue. Monet liked green. Old Italian artists used many colors. If I wanted to be an artist, this picture could be my start.\n\nI picked up a pencil. My hand moved over the paper. I wanted to draw. But my hand was not listening to me. It went to the toilet instead. I tried to draw, but my hand hit the toilet handle. The brown package in the toilet bowl did not move. It was stuck.\n\nI used a mop to clean the toilet. I put on my green tie and frowned. I looked at the package. It was a mess. It was someone else's problem. I wanted some peace and quiet. I held the toilet paper roll and wrapped it around my hand like a mitt. I bent down and put my hand in the water. It was like putting a turkey in the oven.",
            "Many young drivers are dying in car accidents.  Several things come together to cause this problem.  One thing is that young brains are not ready for driving.  They do not have enough experience.  This lack of experience causes many more accidents, and also more accidents where cars turn over, speed, or go off the road.\n\nYoung people also drive more carefully when they are with older drivers.  This is true  A study in Southern California found that the age of the passenger affects the number of car accidents.\n\nSome states have a special license for young drivers.  This license limits the hours they can drive and the number of people they can have in the car.  But this is not enough to solve the problem.  The problem is that young drivers are not ready to handle the risks of driving.  A scientist named Marvin Zuckerman thinks that 18 is too young to get a driver's license.  He says that people under 19 or 20 often like to take risks just for the fun of it.  This is why we should wait until they are older to let them drive.\n\nIf we continue to give licenses to young drivers, we will see more accidents and more people will die.  In a few years, many more young drivers will be on the road.  This could be very bad.\n\nWe can solve this problem with a new law.  Schools can teach people to drive, but no one under 18 can get a driver's license.  A young person can still get a permit before they get a full license.  They will still have to practice driving with an adult for a certain number of hours.  The number of hours can be the same as most states now require.  A national law would be a good way to keep young drivers safe across the country.\n\nThis idea is not new.  Other people have thought of it before.",
            "I looked at movies from the Library of Congress. They are from the early days of film maker Thomas Edison. I wanted to see all the movies that used tricks. There were fifteen of these movies from 1895 to 1901. These films use creative editing to make tricks. My study of film looked at how most of these movies used tricks. I also looked at some later movies that did things differently. At the time, trick movies usually take place on a stage. The camera does not move. It shows the whole scene at once. The movies use many long shots and some medium shots. But they do not use close-up shots.\n\nMany of these movies are set on a stage with a front wall. The camera does not move to follow actors. It stays in one place. This style came from the theater and magic shows. Actors in these movies can only move side to side. They do not walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in the movie Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors come in from the right and move back and forth.\n\nMost of these movies also use long shots and some medium shots. Close-up shots are never used. This is because the theater and magic shows show the whole performance at once. The audience sees the whole scene, not just a small part. Most of these movies are short, about one minute or less. They show simple tricks like magic and disappearing acts. But sometimes, one \"shot\" in the movie can be made from many physical shots. Look at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) and you will see how it is done.",
            "John Taylor was a big supporter of the idea of being a republic. He was a farmer and a politician. Because of these jobs, he was known for his strong feelings about freedom and government. He believed that farming was the best job. This idea influenced his thoughts about government, the law, and the court system.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States had a great chance to make a perfect system of government. This was because there was no tradition from the past to follow. He believed in the idea that people have natural rights. These rights are important because they are all connected. If one right is taken away, the other rights are not as valuable. He thought the government should not control these rights. He believed that in a natural state, strong people would take advantage of others. But in a society, this should not happen.\n\nTo create a perfect society, Taylor thought the government should understand that people have good and bad qualities. He believed in a simple way of thinking about good and bad. He said that governments are run by people and have good and bad qualities. He thought a good government should protect private property, help farming, and not support a system where some people get rich at the expense of others. He believed that a good government would work well, even if its leaders are selfish. He thought selfishness is a natural part of people, but it is bad when it hurts others. A good government should keep people from being too selfish.\n\nTaylor, like many other Republicans, wanted the government to follow the Constitution closely. He wanted the government to have only the powers that the Constitution said it could have. He thought a big government was expensive and might be cruel. But he also thought that following the Constitution too closely could be bad. He believed that the Declaration of Independence was a more important document than the Constitution. This is because it said that the United States was made up of many independent states, not just one country.",
            "We look at Figure 17. There was a big drop in commuter log submissions in the third month. We do not know why this happened. It was winter in New England, so fewer people rode bicycles or walked. This might be part of the reason for the drop. The end of the fall semester was also in December. Students were busy with schoolwork and grades. They might have forgotten to fill out the log. Many students and teachers do not come to campus in December because of the holiday season. They do not need to come to campus during the long break. Classes started again in late January. This might also be a reason for the low number of submissions. But this still does not explain the low number of submissions in February. Maybe a project like this starts with a lot of energy, but then the energy goes down. We tried to fix this with the Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a special week to make people think about the project again. It worked and we got more log submissions. So, one of our problems was keeping the project going. We had a natural decrease in interest, but also a problem with the breaks at school. \n\nAnother problem with this project is that many people like driving their cars. This is a part of our culture. We need to give people reasons to use other ways to get to campus. We gave prizes to people who used alternative transportation. These prizes were gift certificates to local stores. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes might have worked. For example, giving away a bicycle or a car might have made more people participate. The prizes did not change during the project. If we had made the prizes bigger as the project went on, that might have helped. The first prizes were good, but if we had offered more prizes in December and January, like a bicycle or a car, more people might have participated.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that tracks an index, a commodity, or a group of assets. It is like an index fund but more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF gives you the benefits of an index fund and the freedom to sell short, buy on margin, and buy one share at a time. ETFs have low expense ratios, lower than the average mutual fund. But, you must pay a commission for each trade, like buying a stock. Many ETFs are available, giving you choices. However, it is smart to check if the benefits, like diversification, really exist and to what extent.\n\nWe are studying the ETF IHF and comparing it to the top 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of its assets. We will see if owning a single ETF is as good as owning a group of the 10 stocks. We will also see if there is a better way to combine these stocks for higher returns.\n\nTo make it easy, we are only looking at the top 10 stocks. Here are the stocks and their percentage of the total assets.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we will calculate their Beta and Return. We will use the current percentages to make a chart.\n\nThe chart shows that the 10 stocks have a 6.11% higher return than the ETF. The Beta of the 10 stocks is 0.12 lower than the ETF. This means a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could have a higher return with less risk. But, there is a chance the difference is not real.\n\nTo be sure, we need to compare the standard deviation of each stock and the ETF. We will make a chart to see if the differences are real.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's good poems is \"Dream-Land\". In \"Dream-Land\", Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" two times. The word \"Thulé\" comes from the Roman writer Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" in his writing to describe an island north of Britain. The Greeks thought this island was the edge of the world.\n\nPoe read many German books. One German writer he liked was Goethe. Goethe wrote a play called \"Faust\". It was first published in 1808 and the second part was published in 1832, the year Goethe died. Inside \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\". The poem is about a king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. After she dies, the king drinks a lot and cries about his dead wife. He decides it is time to die and gives his things to his children. He then throws the cup into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies.\n\nThe king in \"The King of Thulé\" and the king in \"Dream-Land\" are similar. Maybe Poe used the idea of the king in \"The King of Thulé\" as a way to say how much he missed his own loved ones. Goethe's play \"Faust\" was also made into a play by H P Grattan in 1842, one year before Poe used the word \"Thule\" in his poem \"The Pit and the Pendulum\".\n\nPoe used the word \"Thulé\" in two of his writings. One time he wrote \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". But in \"Dream-Land\", he used \"Thulé\" at the beginning and the end of the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together as two connected poems. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker talks about a land that is dark, lonely, and full of death. He also sees a world without colors. All of these things can be compared to \"The King of Thulé\" where the king is lonely and sad after his wife dies.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe would have known because he liked another writer, Tennyson. Poe said he liked Tennyson. Poe would have also read Goethe's books because many of his books were published in many countries after the first one came out.",
            "In California, if a customer gets hurt after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a store, can they get extra money because the store manager acted very badly? The store manager, Paul Martin, was told twice about the spill, but he did not clean it up for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge is unlikely to quickly reject a customer's request for extra money. To get extra money, the customer must show that the store manager acted very badly on purpose, and that he did not care about the harm this would cause. The customer can argue that the store manager should have known that not cleaning the spill was very bad because many people had slipped on spills in the store before. The customer can also argue that the store manager did not take care of the problem even though he knew it was a problem.\n\nThe customer's argument that the store manager acted very badly is not very strong, but it is still reasonable. This is because there were six slip-and-fall accidents in the store in 2009, and the manager did not do anything to make the store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, a worker at the store told the manager about the applesauce spill. The manager said he was on break and did not have time to deal with customers. Later, another worker told the manager about the spill again, and he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, the customer slipped and fell on the spill and got hurt badly. Before this, there had been five other slip-and-fall accidents in the store in 2009.\n\nThe customer is now suing the store for money because of her injury. We are looking at whether to ask the judge to quickly decide if the customer should get extra money because of the store manager's bad behavior.\n\nIn California, a customer can get extra money if the store acted very badly and broke a rule. The rule says that the store must not act with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Malice means that the store acted on purpose to hurt someone, or if it did not act on purpose, it acted very badly and did not care about the harm it would cause. Courts have said that a store acts very badly if it knows that its actions will cause harm, but it still does its actions anyway.",
            "I took a class in Islam at CBC about four years ago.  We discussed if Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this question is more important now than ever.  Since 9/11, I have noticed that media in America has changed from being against Islam to very tolerant.  I don't think a president with Muslim background like Barack Obama would have been elected in 2001.\n\nThe life of Muhammad is interesting to me.  What I know about his history does not match my idea of him.  I thought Muhammad forced people to become Muslim.  He would conquer tribes and make them join Islam.  But his biography says he was a kind and humble man.  People came to him because they believed in his teachings.\n\nThere are some special things about Muhammad's life that are like Jesus'.  One example is when he had little food and made it enough for many people.  This makes me think the writers wanted to show Muhammad as a kind prophet who didn't need to prove anything.  This doesn't seem right because it takes away from Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that seem to be trying to show how people became Muslim on their own.  But these stories are often from people who heard from others.  This makes the stories seem less believable.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that the writers try to show Muhammad as a kind and wise man.  But history says something different.  I wonder if Muslims know the real story of Muhammad's life.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his beliefs were left behind when Christianity developed after his death.  If we look at the history of Christianity, we see a trend.  It moves away from its roots.  Today, there is a growing awareness and a desire for change.  Traditional people will hold on to what they were taught.  But they are not the majority.  In the future, people will understand the real meaning of Christianity.  They will separate the old ideas added to the religion from Jesus' true message.  This will take time, maybe many years or even centuries.  But it will happen.  The trend of Christian history will change.  People will go back to what Jesus taught.  A movement will grow.  It will remove the old ideas one by one.  The result will be a return to Jesus' ideas, not the ideas of later thinkers.  When this happens in the United States and Europe, many people will follow Jesus' teachings.  They will follow only his ideas.  The church will still be strong and lead the way.  But the many different ideas in Christianity will become fewer.  There will be more agreement about what to believe and how to act.  The world has seen great changes before.  For example, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire.  But later, the empire became Christian.  Our country has changed from slavery to freedom.  A great change is coming.  It will happen in the Christian world.  We will look back to the source of the Christian religion.  We will search for the truth.  This will make it possible to read Jesus' words as symbols, not as literal statements.  What happened after Jesus' death?\n\nLooking far back in history, we find only Judaism.  It is the beginning of the Christian religion.  Judaism believed in one God, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures.  These were the core ideas of the religion when the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.  The Jewish people were not all the same.  They divided into different groups, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people.",
            "I think The Jungle shows that people are naturally selfish. They only think about themselves and try to make their lives better. They do not care about others who are less successful than them. The book shows this in many ways. The owners of big factories only want to make their companies bigger and wealthier. They do not care about anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their work. They do not think about the pollution they create or the animals that suffer because of it. \n\nThe owners also do not care about their workers. They make their workers work very long hours and do not give them any help when they need it. If they want to save money, they will fire many workers at the same time without warning. There were no laws to protect workers in that time, so the owners could do as they wanted. The people who worked and lived in Packingtown were expected to live in very bad conditions. There were no organizations to help them. Some groups, called unions, were formed, but they often helped the owners instead of the workers. The workers were very unhappy and had no way to escape the problems of Packingtown. They were treated like slaves.\n\nThe Jungle says that people in these conditions will act very badly. They will do things that are not right just to survive. This is like slavery.",
            "F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many ways to make readers feel a certain way about important things. He uses these ways to make readers feel good or bad about things. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs words that do not usually go together to make a special feeling around a subject. Other times, he gives a special meaning to a picture and uses it to make the same feeling. Fitzgerald does this with many colors, including gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. In his book The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald makes a special meaning for white and gray colors. He then uses that meaning to make readers have a certain feeling about an important object.\n\nFitzgerald makes the meaning for white and gray to be about being the same. White is a little better and more important. Gray is older and not as new. Fitzgerald starts this in the beginning of the book. He uses these colors a lot. For example, Daisy and Jordan are always wearing white. Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party. Tom wears a white shirt to meet Myrtle. Catherine is very white. The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting a picture of Gatsby's party. The place is colorful. Fitzgerald makes these colors more clear by using them to describe small things. For example, he describes Nick going down a long white area of New York. Gray names are on Nick's list. Catherine's apartment is in a long row of white houses. He also describes plain people or places as white or gray. Jordan and Daisy had a happy white childhood together. There are gray cars and gray land in a place that is not good. A man selling dogs is gray.\n\nAfter Fitzgerald makes the meaning clear, he uses these colors to show that something is not important or is the same. This starts with Daisy. Fitzgerald does not use these colors for a long time. Then he describes Daisy as wearing white in a white car. Readers start to see Daisy as not special, just something that Gatsby wants. Fitzgerald uses this technique again around Daisy to make her seem not special. For example, there is a gray collar on Daisy's coat. She is in a white dress before Tom and Gatsby meet.",
            "San Diego County has a good climate for farming. Many crops grow well there. These include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and fruits like peaches and lemons. Berries and honey are also grown there. People in San Diego want to buy food from local farms. Many of these farms are organic. This means they do not use chemicals. They have waiting lists of people who want to buy their food.\n\nOrganic farms in the area also offer tours. People can walk or hike on the land. They can see birds and other animals. Some farms have special programs. These programs teach people about farming and how to take care of the land.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps keep the soil and water clean. This makes a healthy home for plants and animals. However, organic farming is more expensive than regular farming. It takes more workers to take care of the land without using chemicals. The farmers may lose more crops than regular farmers. Organic farms are often small. They do not have the same efficiency as big farms.\n\nThe land I am talking about is in San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of land. This land is next to a forest and has many different types of plants and animals. Some of these animals are in danger. They include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and several kinds of butterflies. The land was once home to Native Americans. Later, people raised cattle and cut wood there.\n\nI found a real farm in the same area. It is an organic farm. I studied government programs that help small farmers. These programs can make farming easier and cheaper. They can also help farmers take care of the land and the animals that live there.",
            "Culture is very important in negotiation. To understand culture, we must know what it is not. Culture is not the same everywhere. It is not one thing or the same for everyone. People often make general statements about a country or group, like \"all Russians are stubborn.\" But these statements are not true.\n\nIt is better to understand how a culture feels about a situation. We can learn about a culture by studying its history, its customs, and its values. We should not try to change a culture or judge it. We should accept it and work with it. This is especially important when we are in a weak position in a negotiation. Showing respect for a culture can help us get past any problems and move forward.\n\nCulture is not just about countries or nations. Companies also have their own cultures. For example, some companies work very long hours, while others have more relaxed schedules. We can see a company's culture in how its employees dress, how they communicate, and how they work together. Some companies want their employees to be involved in charity work, while others do not.\n\nUnderstanding values is very important too. Values are the reasons behind a culture. For example, if a culture values being polite, someone from that culture will not want to make their company or boss look bad in public. If a culture values making a good deal, someone from that culture will not give up easily. We should think about these things before we start negotiating. We should also try to get to know the person we are negotiating with, so we can make the negotiation more effective.",
            "A famous Bible quote says, \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quote is from Psalm 14. It is also the start of a discussion by St. Anselm about the existence of God. Thomas Aquinas also believes in God. Both have good reasons to believe. To compare their ideas, we must first assume they are both right about the God of the Bible. If we had a different idea of God, we could not compare their ideas. \n\nWe will look at both men's ideas. St. Anselm says we can find God inside ourselves. He says we cannot think of a God that does not exist. This idea is hard to explain. But in simple words, it means the proof of God is in our minds. Anselm says we do not need outside evidence to prove God exists. This idea is called faith. Faith is trusting in something without proof.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different idea. He says we can prove God exists with reason and evidence. We do not need faith. This idea is good for spreading the message of God. We can use logic to convince people to believe. Aquinas gives five reasons to prove God exists. These are change, cause, chance, good and bad things, and order. He says we can know God is real by using these reasons.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born. He would later be called Buddha. He gave up the world and became wise. His teachings created Buddhism. One part of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism. This religion is about 2,500 years old. It has changed over time. You can see this in the Theravada country of Sri Lanka. There, people celebrate a special ceremony every year. Monks and lay people take part in this ceremony. But Buddha never taught about this festival. These changes are not just in small things. They also affect the main ideas of the religion.\n\nWe need to understand some special terms. We will use them often. An internal force is a force from within the Buddhist group. An external force is a force from someone who is not Buddhist. A hostile force is any force that hurts the Buddhist group. A benign force is a force that does not want to hurt the Buddhist group, but may still cause harm.\n\nFirst, let's look at the main ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists trust in three things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is a collection of Buddhist texts. It has three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has the teachings of the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for living. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the nature of things. Some of these ideas are Anatta (there is no soul), Dukkha (life is suffering), and Anicca (everything is impermanent). If we understand these ideas, we can end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. We can also end lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). This happens when we become enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. Lay people have five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not be immoral, and do not take drugs. Monks have many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long time rivalry.  It lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145) The biggest fight was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. The United States won and took Texas and the Southwest from Mexico. There were many other fights. The rivalry stopped just before World War I. \n\nThis is not new. Many countries have a long time rivalry with a neighbor.  Countries that share a border often have disagreements. These disagreements can make two countries enemies. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries that have a long time rivalry. David M. Pletcher (1977) says that there are only two countries in the world with a long time rivalry with the United States. One is Mexico and the other is Cuba. Both countries are close to the United States. They have been enemies of the United States for a long time. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States.\n\nReligion was a problem between the United States and Mexico. This is not new. Many countries have had problems because of religion in the past. Sally Frahm (2001) says that Americans did not like Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries. This was a big problem between the United States and Mexico. The two countries did not like each other because of their different beliefs.\n\nThe United States and Mexico did not like each other because they inherited feelings of distrust from their former rulers. The English and Spanish did not like each other, and this feeling was passed down to the United States and Mexico. This made it difficult for the two countries to have good relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) say that there were 17 fights between the United States and Mexico during their 57-year rivalry. Most of the fights were about border problems and raids from Mexico into the United States. The problem of border raids went on for a long time. It stopped only when both countries used their military to control their borders. \n\nSchmitt (1974) says that the rivalry ended as Mexico became dependent on the United States. The United States changed its goals from taking land to helping Mexico economically. This happened in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became very sick with an illness I did not know I had. I was a nurse at that time. I chose my job because I wanted to be safe and have a good life. When I was young, people told me, \"You will always have a job. People will always get sick.\"\n\nI wanted to be a scientist or a journalist, but I chose nursing instead. Now, I am 46 years old and alone. I have no money and cannot work. I get help from Social Security, but every day is hard. I feel afraid and sad.\n\nI have been dependent on my family and some friends for support. I know that without them, I would not have made it. When bad things happen, it is hard to be strong.\n\nMy point is that everyone has bad times. We cannot always be alone and handle everything on our own. We need help and support from others.\n\nI think the United States government is not always reliable. It is like a broken house. We should learn to trust and help each other instead of just relying on the government.\n\nThe people who started this country were not alone. They had each other's help and support. We, too, can learn from that.\n\nI am prepared for emergencies. I have a special box with food, water, and other things I need. I have flashlights and candles, too. But being prepared is not the only thing. We need to know our neighbors and help each other.",
            "Why do living things change over time? Are there limits to how they change? Many people have tried to answer these questions, but it is still not easy. In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that it is hard to explain even simple living things in simple terms. Today, we use math to study how living things change. We are also using math to study how a group of animals called mollusks grow their shells. Our study is looking at how math and experiments can help us understand how living things change over time.\n\nWe studied a group of mollusks called Prunum. We used special pictures of their shells to find numbers that we can use in math problems. We used a computer program to make math models of their shells. These models can help us understand how their shells can change. We combined our math models with experiments and observations to learn more about how these animals change over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows as the animal gets older. It grows in a spiral shape around a central point. We can count the turns of the spiral, which are called whorls. Each whorl has a line that separates it from the one before it. This line is called a suture. The biggest whorl is the one at the end of the shell. The tip of the shell is called the apex, and the other end is called the base. The animal comes out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells from different angles. One way is to look at the tip, another way is to look at the base, and another way is to look at the opening. Most people look at shells from the side, with the opening facing them.\n\nTo count the whorls, we look at the shell from the tip. We draw a line where the first suture starts. Then we count the whorls from that line. We can estimate the number of whorls to a quarter of one.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows. We can find the path by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the opening. We can draw a picture of the path and write math equations to explain it. Once we have a math equation, we can change the numbers and see how the shell changes.",
            "Indonesia has not seen much change in the death rate of newborn and baby children over the last 10 years.  The country is on track to meet some of the goals set by the Millennium Development Plans, like improving water and sanitation.  However, the country is not meeting its goals for improving the health of children and mothers.  The country needs to improve its health system, not just individual health programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress.  More babies are now born with a trained health worker present.  But this does not mean that the health worker is a doctor.  Many are nurses or midwives who cannot help if there are serious problems.  This means many mothers die from bleeding during pregnancy.  Indonesia needs to do more to improve this area.  Fewer children under five years old are being treated for diarrhea.  We do not have complete information about how well new mothers are being taken care of after giving birth.  But it is clear that this is a problem.\n\nMore babies are not born by C-section than they should be.  There is a problem with how babies are born in rural areas.  In cities, 7% of babies are born by C-section.  In rural areas, it is only 2%.  This shows that people in cities have better access to healthcare.  Another problem is that the rich have better access to healthcare than the poor.  The poor have to pay money out of their own pockets, and this makes it hard for them to get the care they need.\n\nThe next step is to find a way to make healthcare services more available.  One question is whether Indonesia should focus on one area at a time or improve the overall healthcare system.  Program-specific approaches can be effective and fast.  But they have some problems.  Investing in one area can mean less money for other important areas.  This can cause problems with training and equipment.  It can also cause confusion and waste.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their detailed descriptions. But two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are different from others in this group. They use mystery and strange events to make their characters more interesting. These unusual events give us a better understanding of the characters' feelings and reasons for acting in certain ways.\n\nFor example, in Oliver Twist, the main character has many strange thoughts and feelings. He is walking with two men who are arguing. The words they are saying are loud in his ears. He looks around and sees that there is a lot of noise and confusion. He is being taken away quickly, but he feels a lot of pain.\n\nIn these novels, the authors use strange and unclear events to show what is happening inside the characters' minds. In Oliver Twist, these events often help us understand what is hurting Oliver and what he knows about the world around him. In one scene, Oliver relives a shooting that happened earlier in the book. He sees and feels it as if it is happening again. This scene shows that Oliver has no control over the events in his life. He is in a lot of pain and is afraid.\n\nOliver's lack of control is clear when he cannot even try to stop what is happening to him, even when his life is in danger. This makes us think that Oliver is giving up. He may be losing his ability to make choices and act on his own. Otherwise, he would try to save himself, even if it was just for his own life.\n\nAnother example from Wuthering Heights is: \"The day passed quickly – but it was not a real day. It was gone before it started, and the night came back again. The night was long and quiet – but it was also short. It lasted only a few hours.\"",
            "I worked with a program for students after school two years ago. My job was to help them with their school work. I was good at helping with English and reading. A teacher asked me to work with a boy named Adrian. He was having trouble reading. I was surprised. He could speak English well, but he had trouble with the letters. Some letters he knew, but others he did not.\n\nI thought he might have a problem because his family was from a different country. When his mother came to talk to me, I could not understand her. She only spoke Spanish. But we were able to talk a little bit. I then understood the problem. Adrian knew how to read, but he did not know the English alphabet.\n\nI tell this story to show that language can be a big problem for some students. Even if a student speaks English well, reading can still be hard. I think many people agree that this is a big problem. So, what can we do? I think tutoring in reading, especially the alphabet and how to say the letters, can help. But for students who do not speak English well, it is harder.\n\nThere is no one solution to the problem. Some people think that bilingual programs are good. This means teaching students two languages at the same time. Research shows that students in these programs do well in school. Some people are afraid that it will not help many students. They think it is a waste of time and money. But this is not true. If we make bilingual programs the rule, not the exception, all students will benefit.\n\nSo, how do we do this? Do we make all teachers speak two languages? No, that is not possible or fair. But we can have special helpers, like tutors, who speak two languages. They can work with students who need help.",
            "We are taught from a young age that something big is out there that we cannot understand.  Some people go to school to learn about it.  Others search within themselves for answers.  Many people accept the religions taught by their parents.  But some people do not believe.  They think there is no life after death.  We look for a way to understand the world.  We search for a light in the dark.\n\nOne day, my father and I sat on our porch.  We listened to the rain.  He said, \"A cardinal is my favorite bird.\"  I asked him why.  He looked out into the rain.  His eyes looked sad.  He was not eating well and looked weak.  I sat close to him.  We watched the rain together.\n\nLater, my father died.  He was sick for a long time.  The medicine did not help.  He lived a few more months than the doctors said.  I was sad.  I thought, \"What kind of God would make him suffer?\"  I did not pray.  If God existed, I thought, he was not listening to me.\n\nI did not want to see my father die.  I wanted to remember how he lived, not how he died.  I knew my father better than anyone else.  I knew he would not want me to see him die.  I stayed in my bed for three days.  I waited for news.  But no one called me.",
            "The Gothic novel is a mix of old and new ideas. It is also called an oxymoron, which means a combination of two things that do not go together, like 'old' and 'new.' \n\nThe first Gothic novel was written by Horace Walpole. It is called \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Walpole used old and new ideas to create a new kind of story. He took old theatrical elements and combined them with new ideas from modern novels. This created a new way of writing.\n\nThe Gothic novel is based on old things like medieval theater, architecture, and traditions. Many people thought these old things were old-fashioned and not good enough for modern times. But Walpole used these old things in a new way to create a new kind of story.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is a quality that knights are supposed to have. They are brave, honest, and kind. Walpole wanted to show that people in his time did not have these qualities. He wrote about a character named Frederic. Frederic is a prince who is brave and kind. He has suffered a lot and is supposed to be dead. But he is not. He is a good example of a knight.\n\nWalpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto\" during a time when there was a lot of trouble in the country. He was unhappy with the way things were going. He wanted to write about a time when things were better. He used the idea of chivalry to show that people in his time were not living up to the standards of the past. He wanted to say that people were not as good as they used to be.\n\nWalpole's ideas about chivalry and the past are still popular today. They are part of the Gothic style of writing, which is still used in many stories. The Gothic novel is a mix of old and new ideas, and it continues to be popular because of its unique style.",
            "The supply chain is a series of steps to get goods from the customer to the customer. It starts with the raw materials and ends with the customer.  This idea was first used in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver.  Keith Oliver said that supply chain management is planning, making decisions, and controlling the process to meet customers' needs quickly and efficiently. \n\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give good service to their customers.\n\nProduction is the first step. Production is the foundation for the whole supply chain. It decides when, why, where, and how things are made. Managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to find out what the customers want. The market is the biggest sign of what customers want. After looking at the market, managers decide what products to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make the products and what plant will be best for quality and amount. They think about customer demand and satisfaction. After choosing a place to make the products, managers focus on planning workloads and equipment maintenance.\n\nSupply is the second key part. Supply means making decisions about what a business can do best and what to do with others. A business can have many teams to make a product. Each team has different tools, workers, and experts. Managers decide which team is best for each step. They may also send work to other companies. The main reason is to go faster and be flexible while keeping costs low.\n\nThese two parts are very important. If they are not planned carefully, a company may lose time and money in the long run. For example, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target. They have a plan for every part of the business. They have a design for employee uniforms and a plan for when shipments come in. This helps the company work smoothly and avoid confusion.\n\nOther key parts of the supply chain are inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers use these parts to give good service to customers.",
            "A sign in Burma, also known as Myanmar, says Hitler is still alive. Ellen Page, a famous actress, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard. The sign on the cardboard is very disturbing.\n\nBurma is a country in Southeast Asia. A group of military leaders took control of the country in 1962. In 2007, many people went to the streets to protest against the government. They were led by Buddhist monks, who wear orange robes. The protests were called the Saffron Revolution. But the military leaders did not like the protests. They started to be violent. They even attacked and destroyed some of the monks' homes.\n\nForeign journalists, people who report news, were arrested. A Japanese journalist was killed while he was reporting on a protest. The government said 13 people died, but a former army leader said that many more people were killed. He said that it is hard to count the number of deaths because the bodies are hidden.\n\nThis is not a new problem. Governments have been trying to control their people for a long time. Even in ancient times, leaders claimed they were chosen by gods to rule. In some countries, leaders are still believed to be gods. In the United States, the president talks to a leader of a church group.\n\nThere have been many examples of governments being very strict and controlling. In 1989, many students and activists protested in China. The Chinese government said that 200-300 people died, but others said that 2,000-3,000 people died. In Rwanda, a group of people killed many others because of their ethnic group. In Germany, a leader named Hitler and his followers killed many Jewish people.",
            "Duke Ellington was a famous jazz musician. He made jazz better because he lived a long time and was very good at creating music. Often, Ellington played the piano in his songs, but he was also very good at writing music for his whole band. He made a framework for band members to play their own music. Ellington also wrote music that each band member could play in their own special way. This made his music sound good and original.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary says Ellington was good at using voice like a musical instrument in his songs. This was true from the beginning of his career. A good example is Creole Love Call. This slow song is a blues piece with six parts. Each part is different and has a special sound.\n\nPart 1: The voice and woodwind instruments talk to each other. The voice starts singing smooth and then gets rough.\nPart 2: A trumpet player sings a solo. He plays high notes and adds to the song.\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays a fast, high solo. The piano player adds a special rhythm to the music.\nPart 4: The whole band sings like the first part. The brass and woodwind instruments talk to each other.\nPart 5: This is the most exciting part of the song. The woodwind instruments start singing, and the brass and rhythm players add a special sound.\nPart 6: The song goes back to the first part, but the voice sounds like it is growling. The voice plays like a musical instrument.\n\nEllington used voice to add color to his music. This is one reason his songs are special.\n\nIn another song, Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill at writing music for his band. He also uses his ear to make the music sound good. The song has a special sound because of the way the trumpet and voice play together.\n\nIn another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington uses a trombone player named Joe Nanton. Nanton is very good at playing the trombone, and Ellington uses him to start the song.\n\nEllington was a great musician because he was good at using voice and instruments to make music that sounds good. His songs are still popular today.",

She decided she wanted a person, not just something. But she did not feel attracted to any boys. Some boys liked her, but she did not like them. She asked herself many times, \"Why is this happening to me?\" She thought about many reasons, but she did not think it was a good idea.\n\nMost days at home were calm. Her parents were good people. They never argued with each other. They rarely argued with her too. They argued about her wanting to be independent and free. She liked to be different and energetic. This made her a nice person that people liked.\n\nToday was not a calm day. She was looking for something new to be excited about. She heard a loud cry from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice. She ran to the kitchen. She saw her mother on the ground. Her mother was hurt. She was saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. She put her hand on her mother to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her mother was in a lot of pain. \"Okay Mom, where can I pick you up?\" Her mother showed her with her hands. She was happy she could help her mother because of some classes she took to be strong. She carried her mother to the car and put her in the back.

            "This study looked at how following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke. The study used a \"Mediterranean Diet Score\" to measure how well people followed the diet. A high score means people ate a lot of plant food, like fruits, nuts, and whole grains. They ate less animal food and fat. A little bit of alcohol was okay.\n\nPast studies showed that following the Mediterranean Diet can lower the risk of heart disease and death from heart disease. But these studies did not look at stroke. This study looked at 74,886 women who were 38 to 63 years old and did not have heart disease or diabetes. They were part of a big study of female nurses.\n\nThe researchers used food questionnaires to see what the women ate. They asked the women what they ate every year for 20 years. Most of the women answered the questionnaires all 20 years. The researchers checked the food questionnaires against medical records to see if the women got heart disease or had a stroke. They also checked if the women smoked, were overweight, or took aspirin.\n\nTo get a better idea of what the women ate over time, the researchers averaged the food questionnaires from two years at a time. They then adjusted the results to remove things that could make the results seem different, like age, smoking, and weight.\n\nThe researchers used a special method to see if the Mediterranean Diet lowered the risk of heart disease and stroke. They found that women who ate a lot of plant food and less animal food had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. After 20 years, 2391 women got heart disease, 1763 got a stroke, and 1077 died from heart disease or a stroke. Women who ate a lot of plant food had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and a 29% lower risk of stroke.",
            "In 2007, America had a big economic problem. Many people lost their jobs. The housing market crashed. Many big companies went out of business. This economic problem is still here today. We need to know how this problem started and how to stop it. The problem started because of bad decisions made by some people in government. They wanted banks to give loans to people who could not pay them back. The banks also sold these bad loans to other companies. This caused a big problem when people could not pay their loans.\n\nThe problem started 12 years earlier. President Clinton wanted to be re-elected. He wanted to be popular. So, he changed the rules to make it easier to get loans. This made it easier for people to get loans they could not pay back. A reporter in the New York Times wrote about this in 1999. He said the government was pressuring a company called Fannie Mae to give loans to people who could not pay them back. He said this could cause big problems in the future.\n\nThe housing market was also very complicated. Banks were giving out loans that people could not pay back. They were selling these loans to other companies. This connected many parts of the economy to the housing market. Many people in America were borrowing too much money. When the housing market crashed, these people could not pay their loans. The companies that sold these bad loans had big problems.\n\nIn 2007, the top five big banks in America had $4.1 trillion dollars of bad loans. This was 30% of America's total economy. The government had to help some of these banks. The company Fannie Mae had $5 trillion dollars of bad loans. The government had to control it in 2008.",
            "Exposition is a part of a story where the writer tells the reader information about the characters and setting. But sometimes, too much exposition can be bad. It is like a long, boring speech that makes the reader want to fall asleep.\n\nDr. Merlin is a writer who knows about this problem. She calls it \"Too Much Information.\" She says it is like having a devil on the shoulder that tells you to tell too much about the story.\n\nExposition is when the writer tells the reader what happened. It is like a character in a movie saying, \"I'll tell you the whole story.\" In a book, the writer is the one telling the story.\n\nLet's look at an example. A writer might tell the reader that a main character met her husband, got married, and then he was killed. But that is not enough. The writer should show the reader how much the husband loved his wife and how much she loved him. This helps the reader become involved in the story and feel bad when the husband dies.\n\nThe writer should add \"meat\" to the story. This means giving the reader more information about the characters and what they feel. For example, the writer could show how the husband and wife fell in love and how they were happy together. This would make the reader sad when the husband dies.\n\nAs a writer, it is hard to resist telling too much information. But it is not good to rush past important details. For example, a writer might want to tell the reader that a character used to be in the Air Force, works at a gas station, and has certain dreams. But the writer should only include the information that is important to the story.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The top story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife. He is named Shad Hostettler. The news showed his picture. He looked very bad. They spent two minutes on this story. They said he hurt his wife many times and he was arrested.\n\nThe next story was about a shooting in the Sharon Woods area. A man named Travis Buyers was shot. He is 18 years old. He is very sick. The police are looking for the person who did it. This story was short. I think it was short because the man who was shot is black. I have noticed that the news does not always talk about crimes when the victim is black.\n\nThe news also talked about a helicopter that was shot. They found a hole in it. The police think it was shot with a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. The police are looking for the person who shot the helicopter. They are offering a $5,000 reward for information that helps them catch the person.\n\nThe news also talked about the weather. They said it will be hot and rainy on Saturday. They said the temperature will be in the mid-80s all weekend.\n\nThe news also talked about a robbery at a store on Clime Road in Columbus. A black man with a hoodie robbed the store. He is tall and weighs about 150 pounds. They spent a lot of time saying the man was black.\n\nThe news also talked about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer in Texas. He was caught and sentenced to 25 years in prison. They said he was a Hispanic man. I do not think that was important to the story.",
            "There is a strong bond between brothers. This bond contains many emotions. These emotions include love, pride, anger, and sadness. Brothers understand each other better than anyone else. They can see themselves in their brother. When a situation is very bad, the true nature of this bond is clear. It can be good or bad. When brothers have strong feelings, there can be big costs. Understanding these feelings is hard. It means dealing with the bad things that come with them. When you look at a brother, you see your own reflection. You see yourself, not how others see you. Your actions and what happens because of them show your true character.\n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this theme. Two brothers go on a difficult journey. They have strong feelings of anger and pride. In a big moment, they have a bitter fight. Only one brother survives. The story tells us about the feelings of the brothers through direct descriptions of the main character, Doodle, and his brother. It also tells us through the narrator's point of view. This point of view shows the main character's feelings about the world and how they affect his actions.\n\nThe main character feels one main emotion: pride. He wants a brother who can do things with him. He wants a brother to be his friend. But his little brother, Doodle, is sick. Doodle cannot do the things the main character wants him to do. The main character has angry feelings towards Doodle. He even thinks about hurting Doodle. But when Doodle smiles, the main character feels love. This shows that the main character's love for his brother is strong. He wants to take care of Doodle and make him happy.",

They can lead to wrong conclusions. \nThe brain gets information from our senses. Our senses are our eyes, ears, skin, and so on. They turn the world around us into signals that the brain can understand. The brain turns these signals into information that we can think about.\n\nThe brain uses two kinds of information processing. Bottom-up processing is like building a house. We start with small pieces and put them together to make something big. Top-down processing is like having a plan. We use what we already know to make something. For example, when we see a picture of a box, bottom-up processing helps us see that it is a box. Top-down processing helps us understand that it is a black box, not a hole.\n\nThe brain decides how important the information is. It also chooses which parts of the brain to use to think about it. This is called attention. For example, we can see many things when we look at the grass, but our brain does not make us think about them all. We might hear our name in a noisy room and understand what it means.\n\nThe brain has many stages of processing information. It also has different kinds of memory. We have sensory memory, working memory, and long-term memory. We store information and then we must keep it. There are different ways to store information, like seeing, hearing, or understanding. When we store information, we must keep it safe. Some research on animals shows that working memory is like a temporary signal that goes through the brain. Long-term memory is like a special kind of protein that helps us remember.\n\nWe have many ideas about how the brain organizes information. Some ideas come from how people remember things. Some ideas come from computers. Some ideas come from the way the brain works. One idea is that the brain is like a network. This network has many nodes, or points, that are connected. For example, the node for \"chair\" is connected to the node for \"table.\" The node for \"table\" is connected to the node for \"wooden.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley criticizes the dangers of technology and capitalism in his book Brave New World. In the story, people value community over individuality and are taught to be happy from a young age. But the people are not free. They are controlled by a powerful leader called the World Controller. This story is like a warning about the problems of capitalism. \n\nHuxley uses ideas from a man named Karl Marx. Marx said that people are trapped in a system where they do not understand their place in society. In Brave New World, the people are taught what to think and what to do. They do not think for themselves. This is called false consciousness. The people are busy thinking about their own happiness, not about what is good for them.\n\nThe lower classes in the story are not allowed to be different from the others. They are taught to consume and spend money, but they do not know that they are being controlled. The people in charge, like the World Controller, are in control of everything. They make the rules and the people follow them. This is called hegemony. The people at the top are born into their position and do not think about changing the system. They are happy with their place in society.\n\nIn the story, people do not have deep relationships with each other. They do not feel strong emotions like love. They talk about physical things, like how people look. The people in the story do not question their place in society. They are happy to follow the rules and do what they are told. This shows how capitalism can control people and make them do what they want. \n\nHuxley is warning us about the dangers of a society that values technology and capitalism over individual freedom and happiness. He is saying that if we are not careful, we will lose our freedom and become like the people in Brave New World.",
            "I am a student at University Park. I have been here for two and a half years. Getting around campus can be hard. My freshman year, I lived in a dorm room in East Halls, very far from the center of campus. To get to class in the Willard building, I had to walk 25 minutes. The weather was often bad, making it even harder.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike. He said, \"Bikes are great. It's the best way to get around.\" Bicycling is good for your body and is the fastest way to travel. Eating a meal and biking can take you 30 miles or more.\n\nI now live off campus, far from the center of campus. Buying a bike was a smart choice. I go to class in the Thomas building every day. Walking would take 25 minutes. But biking takes only 5 minutes if I pedal fast.\n\nWalking has its advantages. But I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have a bike, walking would be my only way to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take 30-40 minutes. That's over two hours a week. I don't have time for that.\n\nI think the best solution for getting around campus is to use a bike. If students ride bikes and the campus is built for bicyclists, we can solve the problem of mobility."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I want to study social work to help children who are abused or neglected and to help troubled families. I want to work for the Division of Family and Children Services. I have some important values for social work: service, respect, and a commitment to helping others. I also want to be a good person and improve my skills to help people better. These values are important for social workers and for me.\n\nI have always wanted to help people. In school, I saw people with problems who did not get help. Some people used bad ways to deal with their problems. I wanted to find a way to help. I studied psychology in college. After I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break. One day, a friend told me about a 16-year-old boy who was living with his abusive parents. The boy was scared and wanted to leave. I went to the police and told them my concerns. I said I studied psychology and could help. The police asked me to talk to the parents. They said their son was bad and used excuses to blame him. After that, I decided to become a social worker to help children with family problems.\n\nI also care about social justice. We say that every person is important, but we often do the same things as others. I do not want to be like everyone else. I want to be myself. In school, I stood up for what I believe in. I wore what I wanted, colored my hair, and spoke out against racism and injustice. I will continue to stand up for what is right.",
            "This paper talks about two models that help us understand a sleep problem called insomnia. The biological model looks at how genetics and medical reasons can cause insomnia. The sociocultural model looks at how the environment and social factors affect insomnia.\n\nThe biological model says that insomnia can be caused by genetic information and medical problems. The sociocultural model says that environmental factors like race, ethnicity, and economic status can also cause insomnia.\n\nThis paper will look at some research that relates to these two models. We will explain each study and its findings. Then we will talk about the strengths and weaknesses of each study.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep problem. It can be caused by different things. One type of insomnia is a primary sleep disorder. This means that the problem is not caused by another health issue. Another type of insomnia is caused by a mental health problem. There are also sleep disorders that are caused by medical problems or by using a substance.\n\nThe primary sleep disorders are called Dyssonmias or Parasomnias. Dyssonmias are problems with sleeping or staying awake. They include insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and other sleep disorders. Insomnia is when you have trouble sleeping or staying asleep. Hypersomnia is when you have trouble staying awake. Narcolepsy is a condition that makes you fall asleep suddenly.\n\nThe sociocultural model says that insomnia can be caused by social and environmental factors. For example, a person's economic status or age can affect their sleep. Research has shown that people from different cultures and ethnic groups have different sleep patterns.\n\nOne study looked at how genetics affect sleep. The researchers used mice to study the brain's sleep centers. They found that a special type of neuron in the brain helps us sleep and wake up. They also found that a problem with this neuron can cause insomnia. This study suggests that insomnia can be caused by genetic factors.\n\nAnother study looked at how the environment affects sleep. The researchers found that people who live in noisy or stressful environments have more trouble sleeping. This study suggests that sociocultural factors can cause insomnia.\n\nCritics of these studies say that they are too simple. They say that insomnia is caused by many different factors, and we need more research to understand it. Others say that the studies did not look at enough people, so the results may not be generalizable to the whole population.",
            "This paper talks about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It covers three areas: a definition of CAPD, how to diagnose it, and how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a classroom.\n\nCAPD means the brain has trouble using the information we hear. The brain cannot separate sounds or understand speech well in noisy places. People with CAPD can hear normally, but their brain does not work correctly. CAPD is not the same as being deaf or hard of hearing. \n\nCAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Researchers studied children who had trouble communicating. They developed special tests to help identify the problem. In 1977, a national meeting helped researchers learn more about CAPD.\n\nPeople with CAPD have trouble with different things. They may not be able to find where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble hearing two or more sounds at the same time. They may not be able to recognize patterns in sounds. They may not be able to understand changes in speech. Sometimes, one sound can block out another sound. They may not be able to use sounds to make sense of things. They may not be able to tell what order sounds come in.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, a doctor or a specialist uses special tests. These tests look at how the person hears and responds to sounds. There is no one test that works all the time, and we do not know what causes CAPD. Tests may ask the person to listen to many sounds at once and then say what they heard. More advanced tests measure the sounds that go into the ear and the brain's response.\n\nA teacher in a classroom can help a student with CAPD. They can make sure the student sits near the front of the class where it is quieter. They can also ask the student to repeat what the teacher says so they can make sure they understand. The teacher can also help the student use a note-taker or a hearing aid.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says that using a disguise can be helpful in deceiving people. But using a disguise can also cause problems. In the end, a person may have to decide between keeping their true self or keeping relationships with others. Some people may not be angry if they find out they were tricked. But others may be very upset.\n\nThe play talks about a man who dresses as a woman. This makes it a problem because it raises questions. Why does the man want to hide who he is? In the play, the man dresses as a woman to protect himself. He is in a new place and thinks it is safer. He is very good at being a man, but this makes him lose contact with his female friends. It also makes a woman fall in love with him. He also has feelings for another man.\n\nSome people think that using a disguise can help people understand their true feelings. In the play, two people have feelings they do not express. They are able to understand these feelings when they see the man dressed as a woman. But it is not clear if these people really have feelings for the same sex or if they are just pretending.\n\nThe woman in the play is not really in love with the man. She is just pretending to be in love with him. When she meets the man who is the same as the disguised man, she falls in love with him instead. This shows that the woman does not really have feelings for the man. She is just making fun of people who judge others based on how they look.\n\nThe play is about how people can be tricked into understanding their true feelings. But it also shows that using a disguise can cause problems and make it hard for people to keep their relationships with others.",
            "People have talked about German colonial rule being very cruel. One example is the killing of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. However, German colonial rule was complex and had different rules in different places. Education in the colonies was not the same. \n\nWhen the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many educated and able Africans. The German government had done a good job of teaching Africans in some colonies, like Kamerun. \n\nBut the situation in South West Africa was different. The government did not help much with the education of the native people. They mostly left it to Christian groups. The government, on the other hand, educated many German people who lived in the colony. They built schools and controlled the Christian schools. These policies had a big effect on South West Africa even after German rule ended. \n\nMost of the people in South West Africa did not know how to read or write. Some research says this was because of many social, economic, and political problems. This paper wants to look deeper into these problems. It also wants to look at how German settlers and colonial leaders felt about the native people.\n\nThere are many books and studies about education in the German colonies. Most of these were written in German and were published long ago. These studies mainly described how the educational systems worked in the different colonies. Later studies, written in English, compared education in the different colonies and looked at specific parts of the educational systems. One important study is by Cohen. He compared education in South West Africa and East Africa and looked at why their educational systems were different. According to Cohen, the main reason was the large number of Germans living in South West Africa.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but a lot of the land was desert. Many Germans moved there because it was relatively easy to live in. By 1913, there were about 15,000 Germans living in South West Africa. This was a lot more than in East Africa, where there were about 5,300 Germans.",
            "Heavy Metal music is a popular kind of music. It has grown over 100 years. Many people like it because it is very expressive. It shows a lot of emotions, but the emotions are often dark.\n\nHeavy Metal music has many different kinds. Some of these kinds are very different from each other. This makes it hard to say what Heavy Metal music is. It has many ideas from other kinds of music. But Heavy Metal music started from somewhere.\n\nHeavy Metal music is about darkness. It is often loud and has many strong beats. The people who play Heavy Metal music are very good at playing their instruments. They make the music sound very good.\n\nMany people who play Heavy Metal music use drugs to get ideas for their music. A long time ago, there was a time when many people used drugs. This led to some strange and new kinds of music. Some of this music was very dark and scary.\n\nSome of the ideas for Heavy Metal music came from a long time ago. This was a time when artists wrote very emotional music. Many people who play Heavy Metal music today like these old ideas.\n\nThe Beatles were one of the first groups to make Heavy Metal music. They made a song called Helter Skelter. This song is very loud and has a lot of strong beats. It is considered one of the first Heavy Metal songs. The Beatles made it to show that they could make music as loud and heavy as the Rolling Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a famous artist. He painted his dreams. His 1910 painting, The Dream, shows a woman looking at the wonders of a dreamland. It also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals. He wanted to be famous and respected by other artists and art lovers. But he had a problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he also wanted to be creative and different.\n\nTo understand The Dream, you need to know about Rousseau's life. He was born in 1844 in a town in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith. Rousseau did not go to art school. Instead, he worked for the government until he was 40 years old. He then started painting. Painting helped him feel better after his first wife died and his children were born sick. Many artists in France painted peasants in a romantic way. But Rousseau was a folk painter. He painted what he knew from his life.\n\nRousseau wanted to be famous. He started painting when many other artists were already famous. He did not get recognition until many years after other famous artists like Matisse. Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse wanted to paint in a new and interesting way. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that would make him accepted by the art world.",
            "Many great thinkers have said that ethics and beauty are connected. They think that truth and beauty are the same thing. I agree with this idea. As John Keats said, \"Beauty is truth. Truth is beauty. This is all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life through education and experience. But we appreciate beauty and morality without learning about them in school. Both ethics and beauty are about describing things, not telling us what to do. We try to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is right or wrong. But it's hard to fully understand what makes something good or beautiful.\n\nWhen we talk about art, we often discuss things like how it looks or what it means. But these things don't fully explain why it's good. When someone asks about a favorite work of art, they might say, \"There's something special about it.\" They can't fully explain what that is. I think art and morals are the same way. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" We tell stories because words alone are not enough. I think ethics is the same. As Wittgenstein said, \"Ethics can't be explained. Ethics is beyond words.\" I think this \"something special\" is what makes art and morals so powerful.\n\nI believe that ethics and art are connected because they both touch us on a deep level. We experience them in a way that can't be fully understood. This connection is especially strong with literature. Literature is special because it deals with values. As McKean said, \"Literature is important to us because of the values we find there.\" Living involves values, and literature helps us understand those values.",
            "Today's Germany is a strong country. It is a single country with its own culture. This culture comes from the Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. You can also see it in Köln on the Rhine River to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. This unique culture comes from many different groups and tribes.\n\nThe country of Germany has a long history. We do not know for sure how it got its name. Some people think it came from a tribe called the Tungrians. They were called Germans before they moved across the Rhine River and fought against the Gauls.\n\nThe Roman leader Julius Caesar first used the word \"Germanus\" to describe the people he fought against. He took this word from the Gauls. The Gauls used it to describe their neighbors. Caesar wrote about the Germans in his book about the Gallic Wars. He said they lived across the Rhine River and often fought the Gauls.\n\nOther people think the name \"Germany\" came from a spear called a ger. They used this spear in battle. Others think it came from an old word that means \"to shout.\" This was because the Germans were very loud.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in the year 98 AD. He said they were an old group of people who did not mix with other groups. He said they were a difficult group to visit because of their rough land and weather. He also said they had a hard time being friends with the Romans.\n\nThe Germanic tribes lived on the borders of the Roman Empire. They traded goods and skills with the Romans. They also served in the Roman army. This helped them learn from the Romans and improve their own country.",
            "I stared down at the bowl in front of me. My mind was empty and quiet. I was looking at a picture, but I did not think about it much. My mind was like a calm lake. It was looking at the picture, but it was not thinking about it.\n\nI had a book on art once. It was called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" An artist I worked with told me about it. I wanted to learn to draw when I was six years old. The book teaches how to draw. It says to put a frame around the picture you want to draw. This helps you see it more clearly.\n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit on a table. But I was too busy to think about drawing it. I was amazed by the picture. It was too much for me to handle. The artist Picasso liked blue. Monet liked green. Old Italian artists used many colors. If I wanted to be an artist, this picture could be my start.\n\nI picked up a pencil. My hand moved over the paper. I wanted to draw. But my hand was not listening to me. It went to the toilet instead. I tried to draw, but my hand hit the toilet handle. The brown package in the toilet bowl did not move. It was stuck.\n\nI used a mop to clean the toilet. I put on my green tie and frowned. I looked at the package. It was a mess. It was someone else's problem. I wanted some peace and quiet. I held the toilet paper roll and wrapped it around my hand like a mitt. I bent down and put my hand in the water. It was like putting a turkey in the oven.",
            "Many young drivers are dying in car accidents.  Several things come together to cause this problem.  One thing is that young brains are not ready for driving.  They do not have enough experience.  This lack of experience causes many more accidents, and also more accidents where cars turn over, speed, or go off the road.\n\nYoung people also drive more carefully when they are with older drivers.  This is true  A study in Southern California found that the age of the passenger affects the number of car accidents.\n\nSome states have a special license for young drivers.  This license limits the hours they can drive and the number of people they can have in the car.  But this is not enough to solve the problem.  The problem is that young drivers are not ready to handle the risks of driving.  A scientist named Marvin Zuckerman thinks that 18 is too young to get a driver's license.  He says that people under 19 or 20 often like to take risks just for the fun of it.  This is why we should wait until they are older to let them drive.\n\nIf we continue to give licenses to young drivers, we will see more accidents and more people will die.  In a few years, many more young drivers will be on the road.  This could be very bad.\n\nWe can solve this problem with a new law.  Schools can teach people to drive, but no one under 18 can get a driver's license.  A young person can still get a permit before they get a full license.  They will still have to practice driving with an adult for a certain number of hours.  The number of hours can be the same as most states now require.  A national law would be a good way to keep young drivers safe across the country.\n\nThis idea is not new.  Other people have thought of it before.",
            "I looked at movies from the Library of Congress. They are from the early days of film maker Thomas Edison. I wanted to see all the movies that used tricks. There were fifteen of these movies from 1895 to 1901. These films use creative editing to make tricks. My study of film looked at how most of these movies used tricks. I also looked at some later movies that did things differently. At the time, trick movies usually take place on a stage. The camera does not move. It shows the whole scene at once. The movies use many long shots and some medium shots. But they do not use close-up shots.\n\nMany of these movies are set on a stage with a front wall. The camera does not move to follow actors. It stays in one place. This style came from the theater and magic shows. Actors in these movies can only move side to side. They do not walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in the movie Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors come in from the right and move back and forth.\n\nMost of these movies also use long shots and some medium shots. Close-up shots are never used. This is because the theater and magic shows show the whole performance at once. The audience sees the whole scene, not just a small part. Most of these movies are short, about one minute or less. They show simple tricks like magic and disappearing acts. But sometimes, one \"shot\" in the movie can be made from many physical shots. Look at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) and you will see how it is done.",
            "John Taylor was a big supporter of the idea of being a republic. He was a farmer and a politician. Because of these jobs, he was known for his strong feelings about freedom and government. He believed that farming was the best job. This idea influenced his thoughts about government, the law, and the court system.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States had a great chance to make a perfect system of government. This was because there was no tradition from the past to follow. He believed in the idea that people have natural rights. These rights are important because they are all connected. If one right is taken away, the other rights are not as valuable. He thought the government should not control these rights. He believed that in a natural state, strong people would take advantage of others. But in a society, this should not happen.\n\nTo create a perfect society, Taylor thought the government should understand that people have good and bad qualities. He believed in a simple way of thinking about good and bad. He said that governments are run by people and have good and bad qualities. He thought a good government should protect private property, help farming, and not support a system where some people get rich at the expense of others. He believed that a good government would work well, even if its leaders are selfish. He thought selfishness is a natural part of people, but it is bad when it hurts others. A good government should keep people from being too selfish.\n\nTaylor, like many other Republicans, wanted the government to follow the Constitution closely. He wanted the government to have only the powers that the Constitution said it could have. He thought a big government was expensive and might be cruel. But he also thought that following the Constitution too closely could be bad. He believed that the Declaration of Independence was a more important document than the Constitution. This is because it said that the United States was made up of many independent states, not just one country.",
            "We look at Figure 17. There was a big drop in commuter log submissions in the third month. We do not know why this happened. It was winter in New England, so fewer people rode bicycles or walked. This might be part of the reason for the drop. The end of the fall semester was also in December. Students were busy with schoolwork and grades. They might have forgotten to fill out the log. Many students and teachers do not come to campus in December because of the holiday season. They do not need to come to campus during the long break. Classes started again in late January. This might also be a reason for the low number of submissions. But this still does not explain the low number of submissions in February. Maybe a project like this starts with a lot of energy, but then the energy goes down. We tried to fix this with the Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a special week to make people think about the project again. It worked and we got more log submissions. So, one of our problems was keeping the project going. We had a natural decrease in interest, but also a problem with the breaks at school. \n\nAnother problem with this project is that many people like driving their cars. This is a part of our culture. We need to give people reasons to use other ways to get to campus. We gave prizes to people who used alternative transportation. These prizes were gift certificates to local stores. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes might have worked. For example, giving away a bicycle or a car might have made more people participate. The prizes did not change during the project. If we had made the prizes bigger as the project went on, that might have helped. The first prizes were good, but if we had offered more prizes in December and January, like a bicycle or a car, more people might have participated.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that tracks an index, a commodity, or a group of assets. It is like an index fund but more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF gives you the benefits of an index fund and the freedom to sell short, buy on margin, and buy one share at a time. ETFs have low expense ratios, lower than the average mutual fund. But, you must pay a commission for each trade, like buying a stock. Many ETFs are available, giving you choices. However, it is smart to check if the benefits, like diversification, really exist and to what extent.\n\nWe are studying the ETF IHF and comparing it to the top 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of its assets. We will see if owning a single ETF is as good as owning a group of the 10 stocks. We will also see if there is a better way to combine these stocks for higher returns.\n\nTo make it easy, we are only looking at the top 10 stocks. Here are the stocks and their percentage of the total assets.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we will calculate their Beta and Return. We will use the current percentages to make a chart.\n\nThe chart shows that the 10 stocks have a 6.11% higher return than the ETF. The Beta of the 10 stocks is 0.12 lower than the ETF. This means a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could have a higher return with less risk. But, there is a chance the difference is not real.\n\nTo be sure, we need to compare the standard deviation of each stock and the ETF. We will make a chart to see if the differences are real.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's good poems is \"Dream-Land\". In \"Dream-Land\", Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" two times. The word \"Thulé\" comes from the Roman writer Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" in his writing to describe an island north of Britain. The Greeks thought this island was the edge of the world.\n\nPoe read many German books. One German writer he liked was Goethe. Goethe wrote a play called \"Faust\". It was first published in 1808 and the second part was published in 1832, the year Goethe died. Inside \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\". The poem is about a king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. After she dies, the king drinks a lot and cries about his dead wife. He decides it is time to die and gives his things to his children. He then throws the cup into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies.\n\nThe king in \"The King of Thulé\" and the king in \"Dream-Land\" are similar. Maybe Poe used the idea of the king in \"The King of Thulé\" as a way to say how much he missed his own loved ones. Goethe's play \"Faust\" was also made into a play by H P Grattan in 1842, one year before Poe used the word \"Thule\" in his poem \"The Pit and the Pendulum\".\n\nPoe used the word \"Thulé\" in two of his writings. One time he wrote \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". But in \"Dream-Land\", he used \"Thulé\" at the beginning and the end of the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together as two connected poems. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker talks about a land that is dark, lonely, and full of death. He also sees a world without colors. All of these things can be compared to \"The King of Thulé\" where the king is lonely and sad after his wife dies.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe would have known because he liked another writer, Tennyson. Poe said he liked Tennyson. Poe would have also read Goethe's books because many of his books were published in many countries after the first one came out.",
            "In California, if a customer gets hurt after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a store, can they get extra money because the store manager acted very badly? The store manager, Paul Martin, was told twice about the spill, but he did not clean it up for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge is unlikely to quickly reject a customer's request for extra money. To get extra money, the customer must show that the store manager acted very badly on purpose, and that he did not care about the harm this would cause. The customer can argue that the store manager should have known that not cleaning the spill was very bad because many people had slipped on spills in the store before. The customer can also argue that the store manager did not take care of the problem even though he knew it was a problem.\n\nThe customer's argument that the store manager acted very badly is not very strong, but it is still reasonable. This is because there were six slip-and-fall accidents in the store in 2009, and the manager did not do anything to make the store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, a worker at the store told the manager about the applesauce spill. The manager said he was on break and did not have time to deal with customers. Later, another worker told the manager about the spill again, and he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, the customer slipped and fell on the spill and got hurt badly. Before this, there had been five other slip-and-fall accidents in the store in 2009.\n\nThe customer is now suing the store for money because of her injury. We are looking at whether to ask the judge to quickly decide if the customer should get extra money because of the store manager's bad behavior.\n\nIn California, a customer can get extra money if the store acted very badly and broke a rule. The rule says that the store must not act with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Malice means that the store acted on purpose to hurt someone, or if it did not act on purpose, it acted very badly and did not care about the harm it would cause. Courts have said that a store acts very badly if it knows that its actions will cause harm, but it still does its actions anyway.",
            "I took a class in Islam at CBC about four years ago.  We discussed if Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this question is more important now than ever.  Since 9/11, I have noticed that media in America has changed from being against Islam to very tolerant.  I don't think a president with Muslim background like Barack Obama would have been elected in 2001.\n\nThe life of Muhammad is interesting to me.  What I know about his history does not match my idea of him.  I thought Muhammad forced people to become Muslim.  He would conquer tribes and make them join Islam.  But his biography says he was a kind and humble man.  People came to him because they believed in his teachings.\n\nThere are some special things about Muhammad's life that are like Jesus'.  One example is when he had little food and made it enough for many people.  This makes me think the writers wanted to show Muhammad as a kind prophet who didn't need to prove anything.  This doesn't seem right because it takes away from Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that seem to be trying to show how people became Muslim on their own.  But these stories are often from people who heard from others.  This makes the stories seem less believable.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that the writers try to show Muhammad as a kind and wise man.  But history says something different.  I wonder if Muslims know the real story of Muhammad's life.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his beliefs were left behind when Christianity developed after his death.  If we look at the history of Christianity, we see a trend.  It moves away from its roots.  Today, there is a growing awareness and a desire for change.  Traditional people will hold on to what they were taught.  But they are not the majority.  In the future, people will understand the real meaning of Christianity.  They will separate the old ideas added to the religion from Jesus' true message.  This will take time, maybe many years or even centuries.  But it will happen.  The trend of Christian history will change.  People will go back to what Jesus taught.  A movement will grow.  It will remove the old ideas one by one.  The result will be a return to Jesus' ideas, not the ideas of later thinkers.  When this happens in the United States and Europe, many people will follow Jesus' teachings.  They will follow only his ideas.  The church will still be strong and lead the way.  But the many different ideas in Christianity will become fewer.  There will be more agreement about what to believe and how to act.  The world has seen great changes before.  For example, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire.  But later, the empire became Christian.  Our country has changed from slavery to freedom.  A great change is coming.  It will happen in the Christian world.  We will look back to the source of the Christian religion.  We will search for the truth.  This will make it possible to read Jesus' words as symbols, not as literal statements.  What happened after Jesus' death?\n\nLooking far back in history, we find only Judaism.  It is the beginning of the Christian religion.  Judaism believed in one God, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures.  These were the core ideas of the religion when the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.  The Jewish people were not all the same.  They divided into different groups, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people.",
            "I think The Jungle shows that people are naturally selfish. They only think about themselves and try to make their lives better. They do not care about others who are less successful than them. The book shows this in many ways. The owners of big factories only want to make their companies bigger and wealthier. They do not care about anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their work. They do not think about the pollution they create or the animals that suffer because of it. \n\nThe owners also do not care about their workers. They make their workers work very long hours and do not give them any help when they need it. If they want to save money, they will fire many workers at the same time without warning. There were no laws to protect workers in that time, so the owners could do as they wanted. The people who worked and lived in Packingtown were expected to live in very bad conditions. There were no organizations to help them. Some groups, called unions, were formed, but they often helped the owners instead of the workers. The workers were very unhappy and had no way to escape the problems of Packingtown. They were treated like slaves.\n\nThe Jungle says that people in these conditions will act very badly. They will do things that are not right just to survive. This is like slavery.",
            "F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many ways to make readers feel a certain way about important things. He uses these ways to make readers feel good or bad about things. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs words that do not usually go together to make a special feeling around a subject. Other times, he gives a special meaning to a picture and uses it to make the same feeling. Fitzgerald does this with many colors, including gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. In his book The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald makes a special meaning for white and gray colors. He then uses that meaning to make readers have a certain feeling about an important object.\n\nFitzgerald makes the meaning for white and gray to be about being the same. White is a little better and more important. Gray is older and not as new. Fitzgerald starts this in the beginning of the book. He uses these colors a lot. For example, Daisy and Jordan are always wearing white. Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party. Tom wears a white shirt to meet Myrtle. Catherine is very white. The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting a picture of Gatsby's party. The place is colorful. Fitzgerald makes these colors more clear by using them to describe small things. For example, he describes Nick going down a long white area of New York. Gray names are on Nick's list. Catherine's apartment is in a long row of white houses. He also describes plain people or places as white or gray. Jordan and Daisy had a happy white childhood together. There are gray cars and gray land in a place that is not good. A man selling dogs is gray.\n\nAfter Fitzgerald makes the meaning clear, he uses these colors to show that something is not important or is the same. This starts with Daisy. Fitzgerald does not use these colors for a long time. Then he describes Daisy as wearing white in a white car. Readers start to see Daisy as not special, just something that Gatsby wants. Fitzgerald uses this technique again around Daisy to make her seem not special. For example, there is a gray collar on Daisy's coat. She is in a white dress before Tom and Gatsby meet.",
            "San Diego County has a good climate for farming. Many crops grow well there. These include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and fruits like peaches and lemons. Berries and honey are also grown there. People in San Diego want to buy food from local farms. Many of these farms are organic. This means they do not use chemicals. They have waiting lists of people who want to buy their food.\n\nOrganic farms in the area also offer tours. People can walk or hike on the land. They can see birds and other animals. Some farms have special programs. These programs teach people about farming and how to take care of the land.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps keep the soil and water clean. This makes a healthy home for plants and animals. However, organic farming is more expensive than regular farming. It takes more workers to take care of the land without using chemicals. The farmers may lose more crops than regular farmers. Organic farms are often small. They do not have the same efficiency as big farms.\n\nThe land I am talking about is in San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of land. This land is next to a forest and has many different types of plants and animals. Some of these animals are in danger. They include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and several kinds of butterflies. The land was once home to Native Americans. Later, people raised cattle and cut wood there.\n\nI found a real farm in the same area. It is an organic farm. I studied government programs that help small farmers. These programs can make farming easier and cheaper. They can also help farmers take care of the land and the animals that live there.",
            "Culture is very important in negotiation. To understand culture, we must know what it is not. Culture is not the same everywhere. It is not one thing or the same for everyone. People often make general statements about a country or group, like \"all Russians are stubborn.\" But these statements are not true.\n\nIt is better to understand how a culture feels about a situation. We can learn about a culture by studying its history, its customs, and its values. We should not try to change a culture or judge it. We should accept it and work with it. This is especially important when we are in a weak position in a negotiation. Showing respect for a culture can help us get past any problems and move forward.\n\nCulture is not just about countries or nations. Companies also have their own cultures. For example, some companies work very long hours, while others have more relaxed schedules. We can see a company's culture in how its employees dress, how they communicate, and how they work together. Some companies want their employees to be involved in charity work, while others do not.\n\nUnderstanding values is very important too. Values are the reasons behind a culture. For example, if a culture values being polite, someone from that culture will not want to make their company or boss look bad in public. If a culture values making a good deal, someone from that culture will not give up easily. We should think about these things before we start negotiating. We should also try to get to know the person we are negotiating with, so we can make the negotiation more effective.",
            "A famous Bible quote says, \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quote is from Psalm 14. It is also the start of a discussion by St. Anselm about the existence of God. Thomas Aquinas also believes in God. Both have good reasons to believe. To compare their ideas, we must first assume they are both right about the God of the Bible. If we had a different idea of God, we could not compare their ideas. \n\nWe will look at both men's ideas. St. Anselm says we can find God inside ourselves. He says we cannot think of a God that does not exist. This idea is hard to explain. But in simple words, it means the proof of God is in our minds. Anselm says we do not need outside evidence to prove God exists. This idea is called faith. Faith is trusting in something without proof.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different idea. He says we can prove God exists with reason and evidence. We do not need faith. This idea is good for spreading the message of God. We can use logic to convince people to believe. Aquinas gives five reasons to prove God exists. These are change, cause, chance, good and bad things, and order. He says we can know God is real by using these reasons.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born. He would later be called Buddha. He gave up the world and became wise. His teachings created Buddhism. One part of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism. This religion is about 2,500 years old. It has changed over time. You can see this in the Theravada country of Sri Lanka. There, people celebrate a special ceremony every year. Monks and lay people take part in this ceremony. But Buddha never taught about this festival. These changes are not just in small things. They also affect the main ideas of the religion.\n\nWe need to understand some special terms. We will use them often. An internal force is a force from within the Buddhist group. An external force is a force from someone who is not Buddhist. A hostile force is any force that hurts the Buddhist group. A benign force is a force that does not want to hurt the Buddhist group, but may still cause harm.\n\nFirst, let's look at the main ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists trust in three things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is a collection of Buddhist texts. It has three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has the teachings of the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for living. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the nature of things. Some of these ideas are Anatta (there is no soul), Dukkha (life is suffering), and Anicca (everything is impermanent). If we understand these ideas, we can end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. We can also end lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). This happens when we become enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. Lay people have five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not be immoral, and do not take drugs. Monks have many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long time rivalry.  It lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145) The biggest fight was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. The United States won and took Texas and the Southwest from Mexico. There were many other fights. The rivalry stopped just before World War I. \n\nThis is not new. Many countries have a long time rivalry with a neighbor.  Countries that share a border often have disagreements. These disagreements can make two countries enemies. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries that have a long time rivalry. David M. Pletcher (1977) says that there are only two countries in the world with a long time rivalry with the United States. One is Mexico and the other is Cuba. Both countries are close to the United States. They have been enemies of the United States for a long time. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States.\n\nReligion was a problem between the United States and Mexico. This is not new. Many countries have had problems because of religion in the past. Sally Frahm (2001) says that Americans did not like Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries. This was a big problem between the United States and Mexico. The two countries did not like each other because of their different beliefs.\n\nThe United States and Mexico did not like each other because they inherited feelings of distrust from their former rulers. The English and Spanish did not like each other, and this feeling was passed down to the United States and Mexico. This made it difficult for the two countries to have good relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) say that there were 17 fights between the United States and Mexico during their 57-year rivalry. Most of the fights were about border problems and raids from Mexico into the United States. The problem of border raids went on for a long time. It stopped only when both countries used their military to control their borders. \n\nSchmitt (1974) says that the rivalry ended as Mexico became dependent on the United States. The United States changed its goals from taking land to helping Mexico economically. This happened in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I became very sick with an illness I did not know I had. I was a nurse at that time. I chose my job because I wanted to be safe and have a good life.

Now, I am 46 years old and alone. I have no money and cannot work. I get help from Social Security, but every day is hard.

We need help and support from others.\n\nI think the United States government is not always reliable. It is like a broken house. We should learn to trust and help each other instead of just relying on the government.\n\nThe people who started this country were not alone. They had each other's help and support. We, too, can learn from that.\n\nI am prepared for emergencies. I have a special box with food, water, and other things I need. I have flashlights and candles, too.

            "Why do living things change over time? Are there limits to how they change? Many people have tried to answer these questions, but it is still not easy. In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that it is hard to explain even simple living things in simple terms. Today, we use math to study how living things change. We are also using math to study how a group of animals called mollusks grow their shells. Our study is looking at how math and experiments can help us understand how living things change over time.\n\nWe studied a group of mollusks called Prunum. We used special pictures of their shells to find numbers that we can use in math problems. We used a computer program to make math models of their shells. These models can help us understand how their shells can change. We combined our math models with experiments and observations to learn more about how these animals change over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows as the animal gets older. It grows in a spiral shape around a central point. We can count the turns of the spiral, which are called whorls. Each whorl has a line that separates it from the one before it. This line is called a suture. The biggest whorl is the one at the end of the shell. The tip of the shell is called the apex, and the other end is called the base. The animal comes out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells from different angles. One way is to look at the tip, another way is to look at the base, and another way is to look at the opening. Most people look at shells from the side, with the opening facing them.\n\nTo count the whorls, we look at the shell from the tip. We draw a line where the first suture starts. Then we count the whorls from that line. We can estimate the number of whorls to a quarter of one.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows. We can find the path by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the opening. We can draw a picture of the path and write math equations to explain it. Once we have a math equation, we can change the numbers and see how the shell changes.",
            "Indonesia has not seen much change in the death rate of newborn and baby children over the last 10 years.  The country is on track to meet some of the goals set by the Millennium Development Plans, like improving water and sanitation.  However, the country is not meeting its goals for improving the health of children and mothers.  The country needs to improve its health system, not just individual health programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress.  More babies are now born with a trained health worker present.  But this does not mean that the health worker is a doctor.  Many are nurses or midwives who cannot help if there are serious problems.  This means many mothers die from bleeding during pregnancy.  Indonesia needs to do more to improve this area.  Fewer children under five years old are being treated for diarrhea.  We do not have complete information about how well new mothers are being taken care of after giving birth.  But it is clear that this is a problem.\n\nMore babies are not born by C-section than they should be.  There is a problem with how babies are born in rural areas.  In cities, 7% of babies are born by C-section.  In rural areas, it is only 2%.  This shows that people in cities have better access to healthcare.  Another problem is that the rich have better access to healthcare than the poor.  The poor have to pay money out of their own pockets, and this makes it hard for them to get the care they need.\n\nThe next step is to find a way to make healthcare services more available.  One question is whether Indonesia should focus on one area at a time or improve the overall healthcare system.  Program-specific approaches can be effective and fast.  But they have some problems.  Investing in one area can mean less money for other important areas.  This can cause problems with training and equipment.  It can also cause confusion and waste.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their detailed descriptions. But two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are different from others in this group. They use mystery and strange events to make their characters more interesting. These unusual events give us a better understanding of the characters' feelings and reasons for acting in certain ways.\n\nFor example, in Oliver Twist, the main character has many strange thoughts and feelings. He is walking with two men who are arguing. The words they are saying are loud in his ears. He looks around and sees that there is a lot of noise and confusion. He is being taken away quickly, but he feels a lot of pain.\n\nIn these novels, the authors use strange and unclear events to show what is happening inside the characters' minds. In Oliver Twist, these events often help us understand what is hurting Oliver and what he knows about the world around him. In one scene, Oliver relives a shooting that happened earlier in the book. He sees and feels it as if it is happening again. This scene shows that Oliver has no control over the events in his life. He is in a lot of pain and is afraid.\n\nOliver's lack of control is clear when he cannot even try to stop what is happening to him, even when his life is in danger. This makes us think that Oliver is giving up. He may be losing his ability to make choices and act on his own. Otherwise, he would try to save himself, even if it was just for his own life.\n\nAnother example from Wuthering Heights is: \"The day passed quickly – but it was not a real day. It was gone before it started, and the night came back again. The night was long and quiet – but it was also short. It lasted only a few hours.\"",
            "I worked with a program for students after school two years ago. My job was to help them with their school work. I was good at helping with English and reading. A teacher asked me to work with a boy named Adrian. He was having trouble reading. I was surprised. He could speak English well, but he had trouble with the letters. Some letters he knew, but others he did not.\n\nI thought he might have a problem because his family was from a different country. When his mother came to talk to me, I could not understand her. She only spoke Spanish. But we were able to talk a little bit. I then understood the problem. Adrian knew how to read, but he did not know the English alphabet.\n\nI tell this story to show that language can be a big problem for some students. Even if a student speaks English well, reading can still be hard. I think many people agree that this is a big problem. So, what can we do? I think tutoring in reading, especially the alphabet and how to say the letters, can help. But for students who do not speak English well, it is harder.\n\nThere is no one solution to the problem. Some people think that bilingual programs are good. This means teaching students two languages at the same time. Research shows that students in these programs do well in school. Some people are afraid that it will not help many students. They think it is a waste of time and money. But this is not true. If we make bilingual programs the rule, not the exception, all students will benefit.\n\nSo, how do we do this? Do we make all teachers speak two languages? No, that is not possible or fair. But we can have special helpers, like tutors, who speak two languages. They can work with students who need help.",
            "We are taught from a young age that something big is out there that we cannot understand.  Some people go to school to learn about it.  Others search within themselves for answers.  Many people accept the religions taught by their parents.  But some people do not believe.  They think there is no life after death.  We look for a way to understand the world.  We search for a light in the dark.\n\nOne day, my father and I sat on our porch.  We listened to the rain.  He said, \"A cardinal is my favorite bird.\"  I asked him why.  He looked out into the rain.  His eyes looked sad.  He was not eating well and looked weak.  I sat close to him.  We watched the rain together.\n\nLater, my father died.  He was sick for a long time.  The medicine did not help.  He lived a few more months than the doctors said.  I was sad.  I thought, \"What kind of God would make him suffer?\"  I did not pray.  If God existed, I thought, he was not listening to me.\n\nI did not want to see my father die.  I wanted to remember how he lived, not how he died.  I knew my father better than anyone else.  I knew he would not want me to see him die.  I stayed in my bed for three days.  I waited for news.  But no one called me.",
            "The Gothic novel is a mix of old and new ideas. It is also called an oxymoron, which means a combination of two things that do not go together, like 'old' and 'new.' \n\nThe first Gothic novel was written by Horace Walpole. It is called \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Walpole used old and new ideas to create a new kind of story. He took old theatrical elements and combined them with new ideas from modern novels. This created a new way of writing.\n\nThe Gothic novel is based on old things like medieval theater, architecture, and traditions. Many people thought these old things were old-fashioned and not good enough for modern times. But Walpole used these old things in a new way to create a new kind of story.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is a quality that knights are supposed to have. They are brave, honest, and kind. Walpole wanted to show that people in his time did not have these qualities. He wrote about a character named Frederic. Frederic is a prince who is brave and kind. He has suffered a lot and is supposed to be dead. But he is not. He is a good example of a knight.\n\nWalpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto\" during a time when there was a lot of trouble in the country. He was unhappy with the way things were going. He wanted to write about a time when things were better. He used the idea of chivalry to show that people in his time were not living up to the standards of the past. He wanted to say that people were not as good as they used to be.\n\nWalpole's ideas about chivalry and the past are still popular today. They are part of the Gothic style of writing, which is still used in many stories. The Gothic novel is a mix of old and new ideas, and it continues to be popular because of its unique style.",
            "The supply chain is a series of steps to get goods from the customer to the customer. It starts with the raw materials and ends with the customer.  This idea was first used in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver.  Keith Oliver said that supply chain management is planning, making decisions, and controlling the process to meet customers' needs quickly and efficiently. \n\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give good service to their customers.\n\nProduction is the first step. Production is the foundation for the whole supply chain. It decides when, why, where, and how things are made. Managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to find out what the customers want. The market is the biggest sign of what customers want. After looking at the market, managers decide what products to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make the products and what plant will be best for quality and amount. They think about customer demand and satisfaction. After choosing a place to make the products, managers focus on planning workloads and equipment maintenance.\n\nSupply is the second key part. Supply means making decisions about what a business can do best and what to do with others. A business can have many teams to make a product. Each team has different tools, workers, and experts. Managers decide which team is best for each step. They may also send work to other companies. The main reason is to go faster and be flexible while keeping costs low.\n\nThese two parts are very important. If they are not planned carefully, a company may lose time and money in the long run. For example, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target. They have a plan for every part of the business. They have a design for employee uniforms and a plan for when shipments come in. This helps the company work smoothly and avoid confusion.\n\nOther key parts of the supply chain are inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers use these parts to give good service to customers.",
            "A sign in Burma, also known as Myanmar, says Hitler is still alive. Ellen Page, a famous actress, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard. The sign on the cardboard is very disturbing.\n\nBurma is a country in Southeast Asia. A group of military leaders took control of the country in 1962. In 2007, many people went to the streets to protest against the government. They were led by Buddhist monks, who wear orange robes. The protests were called the Saffron Revolution. But the military leaders did not like the protests. They started to be violent. They even attacked and destroyed some of the monks' homes.\n\nForeign journalists, people who report news, were arrested. A Japanese journalist was killed while he was reporting on a protest. The government said 13 people died, but a former army leader said that many more people were killed. He said that it is hard to count the number of deaths because the bodies are hidden.\n\nThis is not a new problem. Governments have been trying to control their people for a long time. Even in ancient times, leaders claimed they were chosen by gods to rule. In some countries, leaders are still believed to be gods. In the United States, the president talks to a leader of a church group.\n\nThere have been many examples of governments being very strict and controlling. In 1989, many students and activists protested in China. The Chinese government said that 200-300 people died, but others said that 2,000-3,000 people died. In Rwanda, a group of people killed many others because of their ethnic group. In Germany, a leader named Hitler and his followers killed many Jewish people.",
            "Duke Ellington was a famous jazz musician. He made jazz better because he lived a long time and was very good at creating music. Often, Ellington played the piano in his songs, but he was also very good at writing music for his whole band. He made a framework for band members to play their own music. Ellington also wrote music that each band member could play in their own special way. This made his music sound good and original.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary says Ellington was good at using voice like a musical instrument in his songs. This was true from the beginning of his career. A good example is Creole Love Call. This slow song is a blues piece with six parts. Each part is different and has a special sound.\n\nPart 1: The voice and woodwind instruments talk to each other. The voice starts singing smooth and then gets rough.\nPart 2: A trumpet player sings a solo. He plays high notes and adds to the song.\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays a fast, high solo. The piano player adds a special rhythm to the music.\nPart 4: The whole band sings like the first part. The brass and woodwind instruments talk to each other.\nPart 5: This is the most exciting part of the song. The woodwind instruments start singing, and the brass and rhythm players add a special sound.\nPart 6: The song goes back to the first part, but the voice sounds like it is growling. The voice plays like a musical instrument.\n\nEllington used voice to add color to his music. This is one reason his songs are special.\n\nIn another song, Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill at writing music for his band. He also uses his ear to make the music sound good. The song has a special sound because of the way the trumpet and voice play together.\n\nIn another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington uses a trombone player named Joe Nanton. Nanton is very good at playing the trombone, and Ellington uses him to start the song.\n\nEllington was a great musician because he was good at using voice and instruments to make music that sounds good. His songs are still popular today.",

She decided she wanted a person, not just something. But she did not feel attracted to any boys. Some boys liked her, but she did not like them. She asked herself many times, \"Why is this happening to me?\" She thought about many reasons, but she did not think it was a good idea.\n\nMost days at home were calm. Her parents were good people. They never argued with each other. They rarely argued with her too. They argued about her wanting to be independent and free. She liked to be different and energetic. This made her a nice person that people liked.\n\nToday was not a calm day. She was looking for something new to be excited about. She heard a loud cry from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice. She ran to the kitchen. She saw her mother on the ground. Her mother was hurt. She was saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. She put her hand on her mother to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her mother was in a lot of pain. \"Okay Mom, where can I pick you up?\" Her mother showed her with her hands. She was happy she could help her mother because of some classes she took to be strong. She carried her mother to the car and put her in the back. Then she drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital had a strong smell of sickness. She was not scared. She was worried about her mother. She helped her mother lie down on a special bed. Then she called for the doctors to help. Some doctors came and took her mother to be looked at. Her daughter waited in worry.\n\nHer mother fell off a small step stool. She was trying to get a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study looked at how following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke. The study used a \"Mediterranean Diet Score\" to measure how well people followed the diet. A high score means people ate a lot of plant food, like fruits, nuts, and whole grains. They ate less animal food and fat. A little bit of alcohol was okay.\n\nPast studies showed that following the Mediterranean Diet can lower the risk of heart disease and death from heart disease. But these studies did not look at stroke. This study looked at 74,886 women who were 38 to 63 years old and did not have heart disease or diabetes. They were part of a big study of female nurses.\n\nThe researchers used food questionnaires to see what the women ate. They asked the women what they ate every year for 20 years. Most of the women answered the questionnaires all 20 years. The researchers checked the food questionnaires against medical records to see if the women got heart disease or had a stroke. They also checked if the women smoked, were overweight, or took aspirin.\n\nTo get a better idea of what the women ate over time, the researchers averaged the food questionnaires from two years at a time. They then adjusted the results to remove things that could make the results seem different, like age, smoking, and weight.\n\nThe researchers used a special method to see if the Mediterranean Diet lowered the risk of heart disease and stroke. They found that women who ate a lot of plant food and less animal food had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. After 20 years, 2391 women got heart disease, 1763 got a stroke, and 1077 died from heart disease or a stroke. Women who ate a lot of plant food had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and a 29% lower risk of stroke.",
            "In 2007, America had a big economic problem. Many people lost their jobs. The housing market crashed. Many big companies went out of business. This economic problem is still here today. We need to know how this problem started and how to stop it. The problem started because of bad decisions made by some people in government. They wanted banks to give loans to people who could not pay them back. The banks also sold these bad loans to other companies. This caused a big problem when people could not pay their loans.\n\nThe problem started 12 years earlier. President Clinton wanted to be re-elected. He wanted to be popular. So, he changed the rules to make it easier to get loans. This made it easier for people to get loans they could not pay back. A reporter in the New York Times wrote about this in 1999. He said the government was pressuring a company called Fannie Mae to give loans to people who could not pay them back. He said this could cause big problems in the future.\n\nThe housing market was also very complicated. Banks were giving out loans that people could not pay back. They were selling these loans to other companies. This connected many parts of the economy to the housing market. Many people in America were borrowing too much money. When the housing market crashed, these people could not pay their loans. The companies that sold these bad loans had big problems.\n\nIn 2007, the top five big banks in America had $4.1 trillion dollars of bad loans. This was 30% of America's total economy. The government had to help some of these banks. The company Fannie Mae had $5 trillion dollars of bad loans. The government had to control it in 2008.",
            "Exposition is a part of a story where the writer tells the reader information about the characters and setting. But sometimes, too much exposition can be bad. It is like a long, boring speech that makes the reader want to fall asleep.\n\nDr. Merlin is a writer who knows about this problem. She calls it \"Too Much Information.\" She says it is like having a devil on the shoulder that tells you to tell too much about the story.\n\nExposition is when the writer tells the reader what happened. It is like a character in a movie saying, \"I'll tell you the whole story.\" In a book, the writer is the one telling the story.\n\nLet's look at an example. A writer might tell the reader that a main character met her husband, got married, and then he was killed. But that is not enough. The writer should show the reader how much the husband loved his wife and how much she loved him. This helps the reader become involved in the story and feel bad when the husband dies.\n\nThe writer should add \"meat\" to the story. This means giving the reader more information about the characters and what they feel. For example, the writer could show how the husband and wife fell in love and how they were happy together. This would make the reader sad when the husband dies.\n\nAs a writer, it is hard to resist telling too much information. But it is not good to rush past important details. For example, a writer might want to tell the reader that a character used to be in the Air Force, works at a gas station, and has certain dreams. But the writer should only include the information that is important to the story.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The top story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife. He is named Shad Hostettler. The news showed his picture. He looked very bad. They spent two minutes on this story. They said he hurt his wife many times and he was arrested.\n\nThe next story was about a shooting in the Sharon Woods area. A man named Travis Buyers was shot. He is 18 years old. He is very sick. The police are looking for the person who did it. This story was short. I think it was short because the man who was shot is black. I have noticed that the news does not always talk about crimes when the victim is black.\n\nThe news also talked about a helicopter that was shot. They found a hole in it. The police think it was shot with a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. The police are looking for the person who shot the helicopter. They are offering a $5,000 reward for information that helps them catch the person.\n\nThe news also talked about the weather. They said it will be hot and rainy on Saturday. They said the temperature will be in the mid-80s all weekend.\n\nThe news also talked about a robbery at a store on Clime Road in Columbus. A black man with a hoodie robbed the store. He is tall and weighs about 150 pounds. They spent a lot of time saying the man was black.\n\nThe news also talked about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer in Texas. He was caught and sentenced to 25 years in prison. They said he was a Hispanic man. I do not think that was important to the story.",
            "There is a strong bond between brothers. This bond contains many emotions. These emotions include love, pride, anger, and sadness. Brothers understand each other better than anyone else. They can see themselves in their brother. When a situation is very bad, the true nature of this bond is clear. It can be good or bad. When brothers have strong feelings, there can be big costs. Understanding these feelings is hard. It means dealing with the bad things that come with them. When you look at a brother, you see your own reflection. You see yourself, not how others see you. Your actions and what happens because of them show your true character.\n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this theme. Two brothers go on a difficult journey. They have strong feelings of anger and pride. In a big moment, they have a bitter fight. Only one brother survives. The story tells us about the feelings of the brothers through direct descriptions of the main character, Doodle, and his brother. It also tells us through the narrator's point of view. This point of view shows the main character's feelings about the world and how they affect his actions.\n\nThe main character feels one main emotion: pride. He wants a brother who can do things with him. He wants a brother to be his friend. But his little brother, Doodle, is sick. Doodle cannot do the things the main character wants him to do. The main character has angry feelings towards Doodle. He even thinks about hurting Doodle. But when Doodle smiles, the main character feels love. This shows that the main character's love for his brother is strong. He wants to take care of Doodle and make him happy.",
            "The human brain is a very complicated system. It helps us think and remember. Over time, people have used different ideas to explain how the brain works. \n- It was like a wax tablet at first.\n- Then it was like a piece of paper.\n- Then it was like a book.\n- Now it is like a computer.\n\nBut these ideas are not very useful. They can lead to wrong conclusions. \nThe brain gets information from our senses. Our senses are our eyes, ears, skin, and so on. They turn the world around us into signals that the brain can understand. The brain turns these signals into information that we can think about.\n\nThe brain uses two kinds of information processing. Bottom-up processing is like building a house. We start with small pieces and put them together to make something big. Top-down processing is like having a plan. We use what we already know to make something. For example, when we see a picture of a box, bottom-up processing helps us see that it is a box. Top-down processing helps us understand that it is a black box, not a hole.\n\nThe brain decides how important the information is. It also chooses which parts of the brain to use to think about it. This is called attention. For example, we can see many things when we look at the grass, but our brain does not make us think about them all. We might hear our name in a noisy room and understand what it means.\n\nThe brain has many stages of processing information. It also has different kinds of memory. We have sensory memory, working memory, and long-term memory. We store information and then we must keep it. There are different ways to store information, like seeing, hearing, or understanding. When we store information, we must keep it safe. Some research on animals shows that working memory is like a temporary signal that goes through the brain. Long-term memory is like a special kind of protein that helps us remember.\n\nWe have many ideas about how the brain organizes information. Some ideas come from how people remember things. Some ideas come from computers. Some ideas come from the way the brain works. One idea is that the brain is like a network. This network has many nodes, or points, that are connected. For example, the node for \"chair\" is connected to the node for \"table.\" The node for \"table\" is connected to the node for \"wooden.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley criticizes the dangers of technology and capitalism in his book Brave New World. In the story, people value community over individuality and are taught to be happy from a young age. But the people are not free. They are controlled by a powerful leader called the World Controller. This story is like a warning about the problems of capitalism. \n\nHuxley uses ideas from a man named Karl Marx. Marx said that people are trapped in a system where they do not understand their place in society. In Brave New World, the people are taught what to think and what to do. They do not think for themselves. This is called false consciousness. The people are busy thinking about their own happiness, not about what is good for them.\n\nThe lower classes in the story are not allowed to be different from the others. They are taught to consume and spend money, but they do not know that they are being controlled. The people in charge, like the World Controller, are in control of everything. They make the rules and the people follow them. This is called hegemony. The people at the top are born into their position and do not think about changing the system. They are happy with their place in society.\n\nIn the story, people do not have deep relationships with each other. They do not feel strong emotions like love. They talk about physical things, like how people look. The people in the story do not question their place in society. They are happy to follow the rules and do what they are told. This shows how capitalism can control people and make them do what they want. \n\nHuxley is warning us about the dangers of a society that values technology and capitalism over individual freedom and happiness. He is saying that if we are not careful, we will lose our freedom and become like the people in Brave New World.",
            "I am a student at University Park. I have been here for two and a half years. Getting around campus can be hard. My freshman year, I lived in a dorm room in East Halls, very far from the center of campus. To get to class in the Willard building, I had to walk 25 minutes. The weather was often bad, making it even harder.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike. He said, \"Bikes are great. It's the best way to get around.\" Bicycling is good for your body and is the fastest way to travel. Eating a meal and biking can take you 30 miles or more.\n\nI now live off campus, far from the center of campus. Buying a bike was a smart choice. I go to class in the Thomas building every day. Walking would take 25 minutes. But biking takes only 5 minutes if I pedal fast.\n\nWalking has its advantages. But I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have a bike, walking would be my only way to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take 30-40 minutes. That's over two hours a week. I don't have time for that.\n\nI think the best solution for getting around campus is to use a bike. If students ride bikes and the campus is built for bicyclists, we can solve the problem of mobility."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

I have some important values for social work: service, respect, and a commitment to helping others. I also want to be a good person and improve my skills to help people better. These values are important for social workers and for me.\n\nI have always wanted to help people. In school, I saw people with problems who did not get help. Some people used bad ways to deal with their problems. I wanted to find a way to help. I studied psychology in college. After I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break. One day, a friend told me about a 16-year-old boy who was living with his abusive parents. The boy was scared and wanted to leave. I went to the police and told them my concerns. I said I studied psychology and could help. The police asked me to talk to the parents. They said their son was bad and used excuses to blame him. After that, I decided to become a social worker to help children with family problems.\n\nI also care about social justice. We say that every person is important, but we often do the same things as others. I do not want to be like everyone else. I want to be myself. In school, I stood up for what I believe in. I wore what I wanted, colored my hair, and spoke out against racism and injustice. I will continue to stand up for what is right.",
            "This paper talks about two models that help us understand a sleep problem called insomnia. The biological model looks at how genetics and medical reasons can cause insomnia. The sociocultural model looks at how the environment and social factors affect insomnia.\n\nThe biological model says that insomnia can be caused by genetic information and medical problems. The sociocultural model says that environmental factors like race, ethnicity, and economic status can also cause insomnia.\n\nThis paper will look at some research that relates to these two models. We will explain each study and its findings. Then we will talk about the strengths and weaknesses of each study.\n\nInsomnia is a sleep problem. It can be caused by different things. One type of insomnia is a primary sleep disorder. This means that the problem is not caused by another health issue. Another type of insomnia is caused by a mental health problem. There are also sleep disorders that are caused by medical problems or by using a substance.\n\nThe primary sleep disorders are called Dyssonmias or Parasomnias. Dyssonmias are problems with sleeping or staying awake. They include insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and other sleep disorders. Insomnia is when you have trouble sleeping or staying asleep. Hypersomnia is when you have trouble staying awake. Narcolepsy is a condition that makes you fall asleep suddenly.\n\nThe sociocultural model says that insomnia can be caused by social and environmental factors. For example, a person's economic status or age can affect their sleep. Research has shown that people from different cultures and ethnic groups have different sleep patterns.\n\nOne study looked at how genetics affect sleep. The researchers used mice to study the brain's sleep centers. They found that a special type of neuron in the brain helps us sleep and wake up. They also found that a problem with this neuron can cause insomnia. This study suggests that insomnia can be caused by genetic factors.\n\nAnother study looked at how the environment affects sleep. The researchers found that people who live in noisy or stressful environments have more trouble sleeping. This study suggests that sociocultural factors can cause insomnia.\n\nCritics of these studies say that they are too simple. They say that insomnia is caused by many different factors, and we need more research to understand it. Others say that the studies did not look at enough people, so the results may not be generalizable to the whole population.",
            "This paper talks about Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It covers three areas: a definition of CAPD, how to diagnose it, and how a teacher can help a student with CAPD in a classroom.\n\nCAPD means the brain has trouble using the information we hear. The brain cannot separate sounds or understand speech well in noisy places. People with CAPD can hear normally, but their brain does not work correctly. CAPD is not the same as being deaf or hard of hearing. \n\nCAPD was first talked about in the 1950s. Researchers studied children who had trouble communicating. They developed special tests to help identify the problem. In 1977, a national meeting helped researchers learn more about CAPD.\n\nPeople with CAPD have trouble with different things. They may not be able to find where a sound is coming from. They may have trouble hearing two or more sounds at the same time. They may not be able to recognize patterns in sounds. They may not be able to understand changes in speech. Sometimes, one sound can block out another sound. They may not be able to use sounds to make sense of things. They may not be able to tell what order sounds come in.\n\nTo find out if someone has CAPD, a doctor or a specialist uses special tests. These tests look at how the person hears and responds to sounds. There is no one test that works all the time, and we do not know what causes CAPD. Tests may ask the person to listen to many sounds at once and then say what they heard. More advanced tests measure the sounds that go into the ear and the brain's response.\n\nA teacher in a classroom can help a student with CAPD. They can make sure the student sits near the front of the class where it is quieter. They can also ask the student to repeat what the teacher says so they can make sure they understand. The teacher can also help the student use a note-taker or a hearing aid.",
            "The play Twelfth Night says that using a disguise can be helpful in deceiving people. But using a disguise can also cause problems. In the end, a person may have to decide between keeping their true self or keeping relationships with others. Some people may not be angry if they find out they were tricked. But others may be very upset.\n\nThe play talks about a man who dresses as a woman. This makes it a problem because it raises questions. Why does the man want to hide who he is? In the play, the man dresses as a woman to protect himself. He is in a new place and thinks it is safer. He is very good at being a man, but this makes him lose contact with his female friends. It also makes a woman fall in love with him. He also has feelings for another man.\n\nSome people think that using a disguise can help people understand their true feelings. In the play, two people have feelings they do not express. They are able to understand these feelings when they see the man dressed as a woman. But it is not clear if these people really have feelings for the same sex or if they are just pretending.\n\nThe woman in the play is not really in love with the man. She is just pretending to be in love with him. When she meets the man who is the same as the disguised man, she falls in love with him instead. This shows that the woman does not really have feelings for the man. She is just making fun of people who judge others based on how they look.\n\nThe play is about how people can be tricked into understanding their true feelings. But it also shows that using a disguise can cause problems and make it hard for people to keep their relationships with others.",
            "People have talked about German colonial rule being very cruel. One example is the killing of the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa. However, German colonial rule was complex and had different rules in different places. Education in the colonies was not the same. \n\nWhen the British took control of German East Africa in 1919, they found many educated and able Africans. The German government had done a good job of teaching Africans in some colonies, like Kamerun. \n\nBut the situation in South West Africa was different. The government did not help much with the education of the native people. They mostly left it to Christian groups. The government, on the other hand, educated many German people who lived in the colony. They built schools and controlled the Christian schools. These policies had a big effect on South West Africa even after German rule ended. \n\nMost of the people in South West Africa did not know how to read or write. Some research says this was because of many social, economic, and political problems. This paper wants to look deeper into these problems. It also wants to look at how German settlers and colonial leaders felt about the native people.\n\nThere are many books and studies about education in the German colonies. Most of these were written in German and were published long ago. These studies mainly described how the educational systems worked in the different colonies. Later studies, written in English, compared education in the different colonies and looked at specific parts of the educational systems. One important study is by Cohen. He compared education in South West Africa and East Africa and looked at why their educational systems were different. According to Cohen, the main reason was the large number of Germans living in South West Africa.\n\nSouth West Africa had a good climate, but a lot of the land was desert. Many Germans moved there because it was relatively easy to live in. By 1913, there were about 15,000 Germans living in South West Africa. This was a lot more than in East Africa, where there were about 5,300 Germans.",

It shows a lot of emotions, but the emotions are often dark.\n\nHeavy Metal music has many different kinds. Some of these kinds are very different from each other. This makes it hard to say what Heavy Metal music is. It has many ideas from other kinds of music. But Heavy Metal music started from somewhere.\n\nHeavy Metal music is about darkness. It is often loud and has many strong beats. The people who play Heavy Metal music are very good at playing their instruments. They make the music sound very good.\n\nMany people who play Heavy Metal music use drugs to get ideas for their music. A long time ago, there was a time when many people used drugs. This led to some strange and new kinds of music. Some of this music was very dark and scary.\n\nSome of the ideas for Heavy Metal music came from a long time ago. This was a time when artists wrote very emotional music. Many people who play Heavy Metal music today like these old ideas.\n\nThe Beatles were one of the first groups to make Heavy Metal music. They made a song called Helter Skelter. This song is very loud and has a lot of strong beats. It is considered one of the first Heavy Metal songs. The Beatles made it to show that they could make music as loud and heavy as the Rolling Stones.",
            "Henri Rousseau was a famous artist. He painted his dreams. His 1910 painting, The Dream, shows a woman looking at the wonders of a dreamland. It also shows Rousseau's own dreams and goals. He wanted to be famous and respected by other artists and art lovers. But he had a problem. He wanted to be accepted by the art world, but he also wanted to be creative and different.\n\nTo understand The Dream, you need to know about Rousseau's life. He was born in 1844 in a town in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith. Rousseau did not go to art school. Instead, he worked for the government until he was 40 years old. He then started painting. Painting helped him feel better after his first wife died and his children were born sick. Many artists in France painted peasants in a romantic way. But Rousseau was a folk painter. He painted what he knew from his life.\n\nRousseau wanted to be famous. He started painting when many other artists were already famous. He did not get recognition until many years after other famous artists like Matisse. Matisse and Rousseau were different. Matisse wanted to paint in a new and interesting way. Rousseau wanted to paint in a way that would make him accepted by the art world.",
            "Many great thinkers have said that ethics and beauty are connected. They think that truth and beauty are the same thing. I agree with this idea. As John Keats said, \"Beauty is truth. Truth is beauty. This is all you need to know.\" We learn many things in life through education and experience. But we appreciate beauty and morality without learning about them in school. Both ethics and beauty are about describing things, not telling us what to do. We try to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is right or wrong. But it's hard to fully understand what makes something good or beautiful.\n\nWhen we talk about art, we often discuss things like how it looks or what it means. But these things don't fully explain why it's good. When someone asks about a favorite work of art, they might say, \"There's something special about it.\" They can't fully explain what that is. I think art and morals are the same way. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" We tell stories because words alone are not enough. I think ethics is the same. As Wittgenstein said, \"Ethics can't be explained. Ethics is beyond words.\" I think this \"something special\" is what makes art and morals so powerful.\n\nI believe that ethics and art are connected because they both touch us on a deep level. We experience them in a way that can't be fully understood. This connection is especially strong with literature. Literature is special because it deals with values. As McKean said, \"Literature is important to us because of the values we find there.\" Living involves values, and literature helps us understand those values.",
            "Today's Germany is a strong country. It is a single country with its own culture. This culture comes from the Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. You can also see it in Köln on the Rhine River to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. This unique culture comes from many different groups and tribes.\n\nThe country of Germany has a long history. We do not know for sure how it got its name. Some people think it came from a tribe called the Tungrians. They were called Germans before they moved across the Rhine River and fought against the Gauls.\n\nThe Roman leader Julius Caesar first used the word \"Germanus\" to describe the people he fought against. He took this word from the Gauls. The Gauls used it to describe their neighbors. Caesar wrote about the Germans in his book about the Gallic Wars. He said they lived across the Rhine River and often fought the Gauls.\n\nOther people think the name \"Germany\" came from a spear called a ger. They used this spear in battle. Others think it came from an old word that means \"to shout.\" This was because the Germans were very loud.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote about the Germans in the year 98 AD. He said they were an old group of people who did not mix with other groups. He said they were a difficult group to visit because of their rough land and weather. He also said they had a hard time being friends with the Romans.\n\nThe Germanic tribes lived on the borders of the Roman Empire. They traded goods and skills with the Romans. They also served in the Roman army. This helped them learn from the Romans and improve their own country.",
            "I stared down at the bowl in front of me. My mind was empty and quiet. I was looking at a picture, but I did not think about it much. My mind was like a calm lake. It was looking at the picture, but it was not thinking about it.\n\nI had a book on art once. It was called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" An artist I worked with told me about it. I wanted to learn to draw when I was six years old. The book teaches how to draw. It says to put a frame around the picture you want to draw. This helps you see it more clearly.\n\nI was looking at a bowl of fruit on a table. But I was too busy to think about drawing it. I was amazed by the picture. It was too much for me to handle. The artist Picasso liked blue. Monet liked green. Old Italian artists used many colors. If I wanted to be an artist, this picture could be my start.\n\nI picked up a pencil. My hand moved over the paper. I wanted to draw. But my hand was not listening to me. It went to the toilet instead. I tried to draw, but my hand hit the toilet handle. The brown package in the toilet bowl did not move. It was stuck.\n\nI used a mop to clean the toilet. I put on my green tie and frowned. I looked at the package. It was a mess. It was someone else's problem. I wanted some peace and quiet. I held the toilet paper roll and wrapped it around my hand like a mitt. I bent down and put my hand in the water. It was like putting a turkey in the oven.",
            "Many young drivers are dying in car accidents.  Several things come together to cause this problem.  One thing is that young brains are not ready for driving.  They do not have enough experience.  This lack of experience causes many more accidents, and also more accidents where cars turn over, speed, or go off the road.\n\nYoung people also drive more carefully when they are with older drivers.  This is true  A study in Southern California found that the age of the passenger affects the number of car accidents.\n\nSome states have a special license for young drivers.  This license limits the hours they can drive and the number of people they can have in the car.  But this is not enough to solve the problem.  The problem is that young drivers are not ready to handle the risks of driving.  A scientist named Marvin Zuckerman thinks that 18 is too young to get a driver's license.  He says that people under 19 or 20 often like to take risks just for the fun of it.  This is why we should wait until they are older to let them drive.\n\nIf we continue to give licenses to young drivers, we will see more accidents and more people will die.  In a few years, many more young drivers will be on the road.  This could be very bad.\n\nWe can solve this problem with a new law.  Schools can teach people to drive, but no one under 18 can get a driver's license.  A young person can still get a permit before they get a full license.  They will still have to practice driving with an adult for a certain number of hours.  The number of hours can be the same as most states now require.  A national law would be a good way to keep young drivers safe across the country.\n\nThis idea is not new.  Other people have thought of it before.",
            "I looked at movies from the Library of Congress. They are from the early days of film maker Thomas Edison. I wanted to see all the movies that used tricks. There were fifteen of these movies from 1895 to 1901. These films use creative editing to make tricks. My study of film looked at how most of these movies used tricks. I also looked at some later movies that did things differently. At the time, trick movies usually take place on a stage. The camera does not move. It shows the whole scene at once. The movies use many long shots and some medium shots. But they do not use close-up shots.\n\nMany of these movies are set on a stage with a front wall. The camera does not move to follow actors. It stays in one place. This style came from the theater and magic shows. Actors in these movies can only move side to side. They do not walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in the movie Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors come in from the right and move back and forth.\n\nMost of these movies also use long shots and some medium shots. Close-up shots are never used. This is because the theater and magic shows show the whole performance at once. The audience sees the whole scene, not just a small part. Most of these movies are short, about one minute or less. They show simple tricks like magic and disappearing acts. But sometimes, one \"shot\" in the movie can be made from many physical shots. Look at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) and you will see how it is done.",
            "John Taylor was a big supporter of the idea of being a republic. He was a farmer and a politician. Because of these jobs, he was known for his strong feelings about freedom and government. He believed that farming was the best job. This idea influenced his thoughts about government, the law, and the court system.\n\nJohn Taylor thought the United States had a great chance to make a perfect system of government. This was because there was no tradition from the past to follow. He believed in the idea that people have natural rights. These rights are important because they are all connected. If one right is taken away, the other rights are not as valuable. He thought the government should not control these rights. He believed that in a natural state, strong people would take advantage of others. But in a society, this should not happen.\n\nTo create a perfect society, Taylor thought the government should understand that people have good and bad qualities. He believed in a simple way of thinking about good and bad. He said that governments are run by people and have good and bad qualities. He thought a good government should protect private property, help farming, and not support a system where some people get rich at the expense of others. He believed that a good government would work well, even if its leaders are selfish. He thought selfishness is a natural part of people, but it is bad when it hurts others. A good government should keep people from being too selfish.\n\nTaylor, like many other Republicans, wanted the government to follow the Constitution closely. He wanted the government to have only the powers that the Constitution said it could have. He thought a big government was expensive and might be cruel. But he also thought that following the Constitution too closely could be bad. He believed that the Declaration of Independence was a more important document than the Constitution. This is because it said that the United States was made up of many independent states, not just one country.",
            "We look at Figure 17. There was a big drop in commuter log submissions in the third month. We do not know why this happened. It was winter in New England, so fewer people rode bicycles or walked. This might be part of the reason for the drop. The end of the fall semester was also in December. Students were busy with schoolwork and grades. They might have forgotten to fill out the log. Many students and teachers do not come to campus in December because of the holiday season. They do not need to come to campus during the long break. Classes started again in late January. This might also be a reason for the low number of submissions. But this still does not explain the low number of submissions in February. Maybe a project like this starts with a lot of energy, but then the energy goes down. We tried to fix this with the Carpool Challenge Week in March. This was a special week to make people think about the project again. It worked and we got more log submissions. So, one of our problems was keeping the project going. We had a natural decrease in interest, but also a problem with the breaks at school. \n\nAnother problem with this project is that many people like driving their cars. This is a part of our culture. We need to give people reasons to use other ways to get to campus. We gave prizes to people who used alternative transportation. These prizes were gift certificates to local stores. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes might have worked. For example, giving away a bicycle or a car might have made more people participate. The prizes did not change during the project. If we had made the prizes bigger as the project went on, that might have helped. The first prizes were good, but if we had offered more prizes in December and January, like a bicycle or a car, more people might have participated.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that tracks an index, a commodity, or a group of assets. It is like an index fund but more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. An ETF gives you the benefits of an index fund and the freedom to sell short, buy on margin, and buy one share at a time. ETFs have low expense ratios, lower than the average mutual fund. But, you must pay a commission for each trade, like buying a stock. Many ETFs are available, giving you choices. However, it is smart to check if the benefits, like diversification, really exist and to what extent.\n\nWe are studying the ETF IHF and comparing it to the top 10 stocks that make up 63.58% of its assets. We will see if owning a single ETF is as good as owning a group of the 10 stocks. We will also see if there is a better way to combine these stocks for higher returns.\n\nTo make it easy, we are only looking at the top 10 stocks. Here are the stocks and their percentage of the total assets.\n\nTo see how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we will calculate their Beta and Return. We will use the current percentages to make a chart.\n\nThe chart shows that the 10 stocks have a 6.11% higher return than the ETF. The Beta of the 10 stocks is 0.12 lower than the ETF. This means a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could have a higher return with less risk. But, there is a chance the difference is not real.\n\nTo be sure, we need to compare the standard deviation of each stock and the ETF. We will make a chart to see if the differences are real.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's good poems is \"Dream-Land\". In \"Dream-Land\", Poe uses the word \"Thulé\" two times. The word \"Thulé\" comes from the Roman writer Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" in his writing to describe an island north of Britain. The Greeks thought this island was the edge of the world.\n\nPoe read many German books. One German writer he liked was Goethe. Goethe wrote a play called \"Faust\". It was first published in 1808 and the second part was published in 1832, the year Goethe died. Inside \"Faust\", there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé\". The poem is about a king whose wife dies after giving him a special cup. After she dies, the king drinks a lot and cries about his dead wife. He decides it is time to die and gives his things to his children. He then throws the cup into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies.\n\nThe king in \"The King of Thulé\" and the king in \"Dream-Land\" are similar. Maybe Poe used the idea of the king in \"The King of Thulé\" as a way to say how much he missed his own loved ones. Goethe's play \"Faust\" was also made into a play by H P Grattan in 1842, one year before Poe used the word \"Thule\" in his poem \"The Pit and the Pendulum\".\n\nPoe used the word \"Thulé\" in two of his writings. One time he wrote \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\". But in \"Dream-Land\", he used \"Thulé\" at the beginning and the end of the poem. \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read together as two connected poems. In \"Dream-Land\", the speaker talks about a land that is dark, lonely, and full of death. He also sees a world without colors. All of these things can be compared to \"The King of Thulé\" where the king is lonely and sad after his wife dies.\n\nGoethe was a famous writer that Poe would have known because he liked another writer, Tennyson. Poe said he liked Tennyson. Poe would have also read Goethe's books because many of his books were published in many countries after the first one came out.",
            "In California, if a customer gets hurt after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a store, can they get extra money because the store manager acted very badly? The store manager, Paul Martin, was told twice about the spill, but he did not clean it up for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner.\n\nA judge is unlikely to quickly reject a customer's request for extra money. To get extra money, the customer must show that the store manager acted very badly on purpose, and that he did not care about the harm this would cause. The customer can argue that the store manager should have known that not cleaning the spill was very bad because many people had slipped on spills in the store before. The customer can also argue that the store manager did not take care of the problem even though he knew it was a problem.\n\nThe customer's argument that the store manager acted very badly is not very strong, but it is still reasonable. This is because there were six slip-and-fall accidents in the store in 2009, and the manager did not do anything to make the store safe.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, a worker at the store told the manager about the applesauce spill. The manager said he was on break and did not have time to deal with customers. Later, another worker told the manager about the spill again, and he said the same thing. At 5:30 pm, the customer slipped and fell on the spill and got hurt badly. Before this, there had been five other slip-and-fall accidents in the store in 2009.\n\nThe customer is now suing the store for money because of her injury. We are looking at whether to ask the judge to quickly decide if the customer should get extra money because of the store manager's bad behavior.\n\nIn California, a customer can get extra money if the store acted very badly and broke a rule. The rule says that the store must not act with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Malice means that the store acted on purpose to hurt someone, or if it did not act on purpose, it acted very badly and did not care about the harm it would cause. Courts have said that a store acts very badly if it knows that its actions will cause harm, but it still does its actions anyway.",
            "I took a class in Islam at CBC about four years ago.  We discussed if Islam is a hostile religion.  I think this question is more important now than ever.  Since 9/11, I have noticed that media in America has changed from being against Islam to very tolerant.  I don't think a president with Muslim background like Barack Obama would have been elected in 2001.\n\nThe life of Muhammad is interesting to me.  What I know about his history does not match my idea of him.  I thought Muhammad forced people to become Muslim.  He would conquer tribes and make them join Islam.  But his biography says he was a kind and humble man.  People came to him because they believed in his teachings.\n\nThere are some special things about Muhammad's life that are like Jesus'.  One example is when he had little food and made it enough for many people.  This makes me think the writers wanted to show Muhammad as a kind prophet who didn't need to prove anything.  This doesn't seem right because it takes away from Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nThere are many stories in the biography that seem to be trying to show how people became Muslim on their own.  But these stories are often from people who heard from others.  This makes the stories seem less believable.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that the writers try to show Muhammad as a kind and wise man.  But history says something different.  I wonder if Muslims know the real story of Muhammad's life.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his beliefs were left behind when Christianity developed after his death.  If we look at the history of Christianity, we see a trend.  It moves away from its roots.  Today, there is a growing awareness and a desire for change.  Traditional people will hold on to what they were taught.  But they are not the majority.  In the future, people will understand the real meaning of Christianity.  They will separate the old ideas added to the religion from Jesus' true message.  This will take time, maybe many years or even centuries.  But it will happen.  The trend of Christian history will change.  People will go back to what Jesus taught.  A movement will grow.  It will remove the old ideas one by one.  The result will be a return to Jesus' ideas, not the ideas of later thinkers.  When this happens in the United States and Europe, many people will follow Jesus' teachings.  They will follow only his ideas.  The church will still be strong and lead the way.  But the many different ideas in Christianity will become fewer.  There will be more agreement about what to believe and how to act.  The world has seen great changes before.  For example, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire.  But later, the empire became Christian.  Our country has changed from slavery to freedom.  A great change is coming.  It will happen in the Christian world.  We will look back to the source of the Christian religion.  We will search for the truth.  This will make it possible to read Jesus' words as symbols, not as literal statements.  What happened after Jesus' death?\n\nLooking far back in history, we find only Judaism.  It is the beginning of the Christian religion.  Judaism believed in one God, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures.  These were the core ideas of the religion when the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.  The Jewish people were not all the same.  They divided into different groups, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people.",
            "I think The Jungle shows that people are naturally selfish. They only think about themselves and try to make their lives better. They do not care about others who are less successful than them. The book shows this in many ways. The owners of big factories only want to make their companies bigger and wealthier. They do not care about anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their work. They do not think about the pollution they create or the animals that suffer because of it. \n\nThe owners also do not care about their workers. They make their workers work very long hours and do not give them any help when they need it. If they want to save money, they will fire many workers at the same time without warning. There were no laws to protect workers in that time, so the owners could do as they wanted. The people who worked and lived in Packingtown were expected to live in very bad conditions. There were no organizations to help them. Some groups, called unions, were formed, but they often helped the owners instead of the workers. The workers were very unhappy and had no way to escape the problems of Packingtown. They were treated like slaves.\n\nThe Jungle says that people in these conditions will act very badly. They will do things that are not right just to survive. This is like slavery.",
            "F. Scott Fitzgerald uses many ways to make readers feel a certain way about important things. He uses these ways to make readers feel good or bad about things. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs words that do not usually go together to make a special feeling around a subject. Other times, he gives a special meaning to a picture and uses it to make the same feeling. Fitzgerald does this with many colors, including gold, green, white, gray, red, and pink. In his book The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald makes a special meaning for white and gray colors. He then uses that meaning to make readers have a certain feeling about an important object.\n\nFitzgerald makes the meaning for white and gray to be about being the same. White is a little better and more important. Gray is older and not as new. Fitzgerald starts this in the beginning of the book. He uses these colors a lot. For example, Daisy and Jordan are always wearing white. Nick wears white clothes to Gatsby's party. Tom wears a white shirt to meet Myrtle. Catherine is very white. The only time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting a picture of Gatsby's party. The place is colorful. Fitzgerald makes these colors more clear by using them to describe small things. For example, he describes Nick going down a long white area of New York. Gray names are on Nick's list. Catherine's apartment is in a long row of white houses. He also describes plain people or places as white or gray. Jordan and Daisy had a happy white childhood together. There are gray cars and gray land in a place that is not good. A man selling dogs is gray.\n\nAfter Fitzgerald makes the meaning clear, he uses these colors to show that something is not important or is the same. This starts with Daisy. Fitzgerald does not use these colors for a long time. Then he describes Daisy as wearing white in a white car. Readers start to see Daisy as not special, just something that Gatsby wants. Fitzgerald uses this technique again around Daisy to make her seem not special. For example, there is a gray collar on Daisy's coat. She is in a white dress before Tom and Gatsby meet.",
            "San Diego County has a good climate for farming. Many crops grow well there. These include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and fruits like peaches and lemons. Berries and honey are also grown there. People in San Diego want to buy food from local farms. Many of these farms are organic. This means they do not use chemicals. They have waiting lists of people who want to buy their food.\n\nOrganic farms in the area also offer tours. People can walk or hike on the land. They can see birds and other animals. Some farms have special programs. These programs teach people about farming and how to take care of the land.\n\nOrganic farming is good for the environment. It helps keep the soil and water clean. This makes a healthy home for plants and animals. However, organic farming is more expensive than regular farming. It takes more workers to take care of the land without using chemicals. The farmers may lose more crops than regular farmers. Organic farms are often small. They do not have the same efficiency as big farms.\n\nThe land I am talking about is in San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of land. This land is next to a forest and has many different types of plants and animals. Some of these animals are in danger. They include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and several kinds of butterflies. The land was once home to Native Americans. Later, people raised cattle and cut wood there.\n\nI found a real farm in the same area. It is an organic farm. I studied government programs that help small farmers. These programs can make farming easier and cheaper. They can also help farmers take care of the land and the animals that live there.",
            "Culture is very important in negotiation. To understand culture, we must know what it is not. Culture is not the same everywhere. It is not one thing or the same for everyone. People often make general statements about a country or group, like \"all Russians are stubborn.\" But these statements are not true.\n\nIt is better to understand how a culture feels about a situation. We can learn about a culture by studying its history, its customs, and its values. We should not try to change a culture or judge it. We should accept it and work with it. This is especially important when we are in a weak position in a negotiation. Showing respect for a culture can help us get past any problems and move forward.\n\nCulture is not just about countries or nations. Companies also have their own cultures. For example, some companies work very long hours, while others have more relaxed schedules. We can see a company's culture in how its employees dress, how they communicate, and how they work together. Some companies want their employees to be involved in charity work, while others do not.\n\nUnderstanding values is very important too. Values are the reasons behind a culture. For example, if a culture values being polite, someone from that culture will not want to make their company or boss look bad in public. If a culture values making a good deal, someone from that culture will not give up easily. We should think about these things before we start negotiating. We should also try to get to know the person we are negotiating with, so we can make the negotiation more effective.",
            "A famous Bible quote says, \"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This quote is from Psalm 14. It is also the start of a discussion by St. Anselm about the existence of God. Thomas Aquinas also believes in God. Both have good reasons to believe. To compare their ideas, we must first assume they are both right about the God of the Bible. If we had a different idea of God, we could not compare their ideas. \n\nWe will look at both men's ideas. St. Anselm says we can find God inside ourselves. He says we cannot think of a God that does not exist. This idea is hard to explain. But in simple words, it means the proof of God is in our minds. Anselm says we do not need outside evidence to prove God exists. This idea is called faith. Faith is trusting in something without proof.\n\nThomas Aquinas has a different idea. He says we can prove God exists with reason and evidence. We do not need faith. This idea is good for spreading the message of God. We can use logic to convince people to believe. Aquinas gives five reasons to prove God exists. These are change, cause, chance, good and bad things, and order. He says we can know God is real by using these reasons.",
            "A long time ago, in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince was born. He would later be called Buddha. He gave up the world and became wise. His teachings created Buddhism. One part of Buddhism is called Theravada Buddhism. This religion is about 2,500 years old. It has changed over time. You can see this in the Theravada country of Sri Lanka. There, people celebrate a special ceremony every year. Monks and lay people take part in this ceremony. But Buddha never taught about this festival. These changes are not just in small things. They also affect the main ideas of the religion.\n\nWe need to understand some special terms. We will use them often. An internal force is a force from within the Buddhist group. An external force is a force from someone who is not Buddhist. A hostile force is any force that hurts the Buddhist group. A benign force is a force that does not want to hurt the Buddhist group, but may still cause harm.\n\nFirst, let's look at the main ideas of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists trust in three things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is a collection of Buddhist texts. It has three parts: the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka has the teachings of the Buddha. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for living. The Abhidhamma Pitaka has ideas about the nature of things. Some of these ideas are Anatta (there is no soul), Dukkha (life is suffering), and Anicca (everything is impermanent). If we understand these ideas, we can end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. We can also end lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). This happens when we become enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. Lay people have five rules: do not kill, do not lie, do not steal, do not be immoral, and do not take drugs. Monks have many more rules. The most important idea in Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico had a long time rivalry.  It lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145) The biggest fight was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. The United States won and took Texas and the Southwest from Mexico. There were many other fights. The rivalry stopped just before World War I. \n\nThis is not new. Many countries have a long time rivalry with a neighbor.  Countries that share a border often have disagreements. These disagreements can make two countries enemies. The United States and Mexico are like many other countries that have a long time rivalry. David M. Pletcher (1977) says that there are only two countries in the world with a long time rivalry with the United States. One is Mexico and the other is Cuba. Both countries are close to the United States. They have been enemies of the United States for a long time. Other countries in Latin America have good relations with the United States.\n\nReligion was a problem between the United States and Mexico. This is not new. Many countries have had problems because of religion in the past. Sally Frahm (2001) says that Americans did not like Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries. This was a big problem between the United States and Mexico. The two countries did not like each other because of their different beliefs.\n\nThe United States and Mexico did not like each other because they inherited feelings of distrust from their former rulers. The English and Spanish did not like each other, and this feeling was passed down to the United States and Mexico. This made it difficult for the two countries to have good relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) say that there were 17 fights between the United States and Mexico during their 57-year rivalry. Most of the fights were about border problems and raids from Mexico into the United States. The problem of border raids went on for a long time. It stopped only when both countries used their military to control their borders. \n\nSchmitt (1974) says that the rivalry ended as Mexico became dependent on the United States. The United States changed its goals from taking land to helping Mexico economically. This happened in the late 19th century.",

            "Why do living things change over time? Are there limits to how they change? Many people have tried to answer these questions, but it is still not easy. In 1917, a scientist named D'Arcy Thompson said that it is hard to explain even simple living things in simple terms. Today, we use math to study how living things change. We are also using math to study how a group of animals called mollusks grow their shells. Our study is looking at how math and experiments can help us understand how living things change over time.\n\nWe studied a group of mollusks called Prunum. We used special pictures of their shells to find numbers that we can use in math problems. We used a computer program to make math models of their shells. These models can help us understand how their shells can change. We combined our math models with experiments and observations to learn more about how these animals change over time.\n\nA shell is like a tube that grows as the animal gets older. It grows in a spiral shape around a central point. We can count the turns of the spiral, which are called whorls. Each whorl has a line that separates it from the one before it. This line is called a suture. The biggest whorl is the one at the end of the shell. The tip of the shell is called the apex, and the other end is called the base. The animal comes out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nWe can look at shells from different angles. One way is to look at the tip, another way is to look at the base, and another way is to look at the opening. Most people look at shells from the side, with the opening facing them.\n\nTo count the whorls, we look at the shell from the tip. We draw a line where the first suture starts. Then we count the whorls from that line. We can estimate the number of whorls to a quarter of one.\n\nA shell is like a path that the animal follows as it grows. We can find the path by looking at the center of each whorl and the size of the opening. We can draw a picture of the path and write math equations to explain it. Once we have a math equation, we can change the numbers and see how the shell changes.",
            "Indonesia has not seen much change in the death rate of newborn and baby children over the last 10 years.  The country is on track to meet some of the goals set by the Millennium Development Plans, like improving water and sanitation.  However, the country is not meeting its goals for improving the health of children and mothers.  The country needs to improve its health system, not just individual health programs.\n\nIndonesia has made some progress.  More babies are now born with a trained health worker present.  But this does not mean that the health worker is a doctor.  Many are nurses or midwives who cannot help if there are serious problems.  This means many mothers die from bleeding during pregnancy.  Indonesia needs to do more to improve this area.  Fewer children under five years old are being treated for diarrhea.  We do not have complete information about how well new mothers are being taken care of after giving birth.  But it is clear that this is a problem.\n\nMore babies are not born by C-section than they should be.  There is a problem with how babies are born in rural areas.  In cities, 7% of babies are born by C-section.  In rural areas, it is only 2%.  This shows that people in cities have better access to healthcare.  Another problem is that the rich have better access to healthcare than the poor.  The poor have to pay money out of their own pockets, and this makes it hard for them to get the care they need.\n\nThe next step is to find a way to make healthcare services more available.  One question is whether Indonesia should focus on one area at a time or improve the overall healthcare system.  Program-specific approaches can be effective and fast.  But they have some problems.  Investing in one area can mean less money for other important areas.  This can cause problems with training and equipment.  It can also cause confusion and waste.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their detailed descriptions. But two novels, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, are different from others in this group. They use mystery and strange events to make their characters more interesting. These unusual events give us a better understanding of the characters' feelings and reasons for acting in certain ways.\n\nFor example, in Oliver Twist, the main character has many strange thoughts and feelings. He is walking with two men who are arguing. The words they are saying are loud in his ears. He looks around and sees that there is a lot of noise and confusion. He is being taken away quickly, but he feels a lot of pain.\n\nIn these novels, the authors use strange and unclear events to show what is happening inside the characters' minds. In Oliver Twist, these events often help us understand what is hurting Oliver and what he knows about the world around him. In one scene, Oliver relives a shooting that happened earlier in the book. He sees and feels it as if it is happening again. This scene shows that Oliver has no control over the events in his life. He is in a lot of pain and is afraid.\n\nOliver's lack of control is clear when he cannot even try to stop what is happening to him, even when his life is in danger. This makes us think that Oliver is giving up. He may be losing his ability to make choices and act on his own. Otherwise, he would try to save himself, even if it was just for his own life.\n\nAnother example from Wuthering Heights is: \"The day passed quickly – but it was not a real day. It was gone before it started, and the night came back again. The night was long and quiet – but it was also short. It lasted only a few hours.\"",
            "I worked with a program for students after school two years ago. My job was to help them with their school work. I was good at helping with English and reading. A teacher asked me to work with a boy named Adrian. He was having trouble reading. I was surprised. He could speak English well, but he had trouble with the letters. Some letters he knew, but others he did not.\n\nI thought he might have a problem because his family was from a different country. When his mother came to talk to me, I could not understand her. She only spoke Spanish. But we were able to talk a little bit. I then understood the problem. Adrian knew how to read, but he did not know the English alphabet.\n\nI tell this story to show that language can be a big problem for some students. Even if a student speaks English well, reading can still be hard. I think many people agree that this is a big problem. So, what can we do? I think tutoring in reading, especially the alphabet and how to say the letters, can help. But for students who do not speak English well, it is harder.\n\nThere is no one solution to the problem. Some people think that bilingual programs are good. This means teaching students two languages at the same time. Research shows that students in these programs do well in school. Some people are afraid that it will not help many students. They think it is a waste of time and money. But this is not true. If we make bilingual programs the rule, not the exception, all students will benefit.\n\nSo, how do we do this? Do we make all teachers speak two languages? No, that is not possible or fair. But we can have special helpers, like tutors, who speak two languages. They can work with students who need help.",
            "We are taught from a young age that something big is out there that we cannot understand.  Some people go to school to learn about it.  Others search within themselves for answers.  Many people accept the religions taught by their parents.  But some people do not believe.  They think there is no life after death.  We look for a way to understand the world.  We search for a light in the dark.\n\nOne day, my father and I sat on our porch.  We listened to the rain.  He said, \"A cardinal is my favorite bird.\"  I asked him why.  He looked out into the rain.  His eyes looked sad.  He was not eating well and looked weak.  I sat close to him.  We watched the rain together.\n\nLater, my father died.  He was sick for a long time.  The medicine did not help.  He lived a few more months than the doctors said.  I was sad.  I thought, \"What kind of God would make him suffer?\"  I did not pray.  If God existed, I thought, he was not listening to me.\n\nI did not want to see my father die.  I wanted to remember how he lived, not how he died.  I knew my father better than anyone else.  I knew he would not want me to see him die.  I stayed in my bed for three days.  I waited for news.  But no one called me.",
            "The Gothic novel is a mix of old and new ideas. It is also called an oxymoron, which means a combination of two things that do not go together, like 'old' and 'new.' \n\nThe first Gothic novel was written by Horace Walpole. It is called \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Walpole used old and new ideas to create a new kind of story. He took old theatrical elements and combined them with new ideas from modern novels. This created a new way of writing.\n\nThe Gothic novel is based on old things like medieval theater, architecture, and traditions. Many people thought these old things were old-fashioned and not good enough for modern times. But Walpole used these old things in a new way to create a new kind of story.\n\nOne important idea in Gothic novels is chivalry. Chivalry is a quality that knights are supposed to have. They are brave, honest, and kind. Walpole wanted to show that people in his time did not have these qualities. He wrote about a character named Frederic. Frederic is a prince who is brave and kind. He has suffered a lot and is supposed to be dead. But he is not. He is a good example of a knight.\n\nWalpole wrote \"The Castle of Otranto\" during a time when there was a lot of trouble in the country. He was unhappy with the way things were going. He wanted to write about a time when things were better. He used the idea of chivalry to show that people in his time were not living up to the standards of the past. He wanted to say that people were not as good as they used to be.\n\nWalpole's ideas about chivalry and the past are still popular today. They are part of the Gothic style of writing, which is still used in many stories. The Gothic novel is a mix of old and new ideas, and it continues to be popular because of its unique style.",
            "The supply chain is a series of steps to get goods from the customer to the customer. It starts with the raw materials and ends with the customer.  This idea was first used in 1982 by a man named Keith Oliver.  Keith Oliver said that supply chain management is planning, making decisions, and controlling the process to meet customers' needs quickly and efficiently. \n\nThere are six main parts of a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these parts to give good service to their customers.\n\nProduction is the first step. Production is the foundation for the whole supply chain. It decides when, why, where, and how things are made. Managers must know what customers want. They look at the market to find out what the customers want. The market is the biggest sign of what customers want. After looking at the market, managers decide what products to make and how many to make. They also decide where to make the products and what plant will be best for quality and amount. They think about customer demand and satisfaction. After choosing a place to make the products, managers focus on planning workloads and equipment maintenance.\n\nSupply is the second key part. Supply means making decisions about what a business can do best and what to do with others. A business can have many teams to make a product. Each team has different tools, workers, and experts. Managers decide which team is best for each step. They may also send work to other companies. The main reason is to go faster and be flexible while keeping costs low.\n\nThese two parts are very important. If they are not planned carefully, a company may lose time and money in the long run. For example, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target. They have a plan for every part of the business. They have a design for employee uniforms and a plan for when shipments come in. This helps the company work smoothly and avoid confusion.\n\nOther key parts of the supply chain are inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers use these parts to give good service to customers.",
            "A sign in Burma, also known as Myanmar, says Hitler is still alive. Ellen Page, a famous actress, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard. The sign on the cardboard is very disturbing.\n\nBurma is a country in Southeast Asia. A group of military leaders took control of the country in 1962. In 2007, many people went to the streets to protest against the government. They were led by Buddhist monks, who wear orange robes. The protests were called the Saffron Revolution. But the military leaders did not like the protests. They started to be violent. They even attacked and destroyed some of the monks' homes.\n\nForeign journalists, people who report news, were arrested. A Japanese journalist was killed while he was reporting on a protest. The government said 13 people died, but a former army leader said that many more people were killed. He said that it is hard to count the number of deaths because the bodies are hidden.\n\nThis is not a new problem. Governments have been trying to control their people for a long time. Even in ancient times, leaders claimed they were chosen by gods to rule. In some countries, leaders are still believed to be gods. In the United States, the president talks to a leader of a church group.\n\nThere have been many examples of governments being very strict and controlling. In 1989, many students and activists protested in China. The Chinese government said that 200-300 people died, but others said that 2,000-3,000 people died. In Rwanda, a group of people killed many others because of their ethnic group. In Germany, a leader named Hitler and his followers killed many Jewish people.",

Often, Ellington played the piano in his songs, but he was also very good at writing music for his whole band. He made a framework for band members to play their own music. Ellington also wrote music that each band member could play in their own special way. This made his music sound good and original.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary says Ellington was good at using voice like a musical instrument in his songs. This was true from the beginning of his career. A good example is Creole Love Call. This slow song is a blues piece with six parts. Each part is different and has a special sound.\n\nPart 1: The voice and woodwind instruments talk to each other. The voice starts singing smooth and then gets rough.\nPart 2: A trumpet player sings a solo. He plays high notes and adds to the song.\nPart 3: A clarinet player plays a fast, high solo. The piano player adds a special rhythm to the music.\nPart 4: The whole band sings like the first part. The brass and woodwind instruments talk to each other.\nPart 5: This is the most exciting part of the song. The woodwind instruments start singing, and the brass and rhythm players add a special sound.\nPart 6: The song goes back to the first part, but the voice sounds like it is growling. The voice plays like a musical instrument.\n\nEllington used voice to add color to his music. This is one reason his songs are special.\n\nIn another song, Hot and Bothered, Ellington uses his skill at writing music for his band. He also uses his ear to make the music sound good. The song has a special sound because of the way the trumpet and voice play together.\n\nIn another song, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington uses a trombone player named Joe Nanton. Nanton is very good at playing the trombone, and Ellington uses him to start the song.\n\nEllington was a great musician because he was good at using voice and instruments to make music that sounds good. His songs are still popular today.",
            "She had a big need. It was a feeling that she could not stop. It started when she was 14. She was growing up and trying to be a young adult. Three years later, at 17, it was still there. She decided she wanted a person, not just something. But she did not feel attracted to any boys. Some boys liked her, but she did not like them. She asked herself many times, \"Why is this happening to me?\" She thought about many reasons, but she did not think it was a good idea.\n\nMost days at home were calm. Her parents were good people. They never argued with each other. They rarely argued with her too. They argued about her wanting to be independent and free. She liked to be different and energetic. This made her a nice person that people liked.\n\nToday was not a calm day. She was looking for something new to be excited about. She heard a loud cry from the kitchen. It was her mother's voice. She ran to the kitchen. She saw her mother on the ground. Her mother was hurt. She was saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. She put her hand on her mother to help. \"Ouch ... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her mother was in a lot of pain. \"Okay Mom, where can I pick you up?\" Her mother showed her with her hands. She was happy she could help her mother because of some classes she took to be strong. She carried her mother to the car and put her in the back. Then she drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital had a strong smell of sickness. She was not scared. She was worried about her mother. She helped her mother lie down on a special bed. Then she called for the doctors to help. Some doctors came and took her mother to be looked at. Her daughter waited in worry.\n\nHer mother fell off a small step stool. She was trying to get a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study looked at how following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" can lower the risk of heart disease and stroke. The study used a \"Mediterranean Diet Score\" to measure how well people followed the diet. A high score means people ate a lot of plant food, like fruits, nuts, and whole grains. They ate less animal food and fat. A little bit of alcohol was okay.\n\nPast studies showed that following the Mediterranean Diet can lower the risk of heart disease and death from heart disease. But these studies did not look at stroke. This study looked at 74,886 women who were 38 to 63 years old and did not have heart disease or diabetes. They were part of a big study of female nurses.\n\nThe researchers used food questionnaires to see what the women ate. They asked the women what they ate every year for 20 years. Most of the women answered the questionnaires all 20 years. The researchers checked the food questionnaires against medical records to see if the women got heart disease or had a stroke. They also checked if the women smoked, were overweight, or took aspirin.\n\nTo get a better idea of what the women ate over time, the researchers averaged the food questionnaires from two years at a time. They then adjusted the results to remove things that could make the results seem different, like age, smoking, and weight.\n\nThe researchers used a special method to see if the Mediterranean Diet lowered the risk of heart disease and stroke. They found that women who ate a lot of plant food and less animal food had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. After 20 years, 2391 women got heart disease, 1763 got a stroke, and 1077 died from heart disease or a stroke. Women who ate a lot of plant food had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and a 29% lower risk of stroke.",
            "In 2007, America had a big economic problem. Many people lost their jobs. The housing market crashed. Many big companies went out of business. This economic problem is still here today. We need to know how this problem started and how to stop it. The problem started because of bad decisions made by some people in government. They wanted banks to give loans to people who could not pay them back. The banks also sold these bad loans to other companies. This caused a big problem when people could not pay their loans.\n\nThe problem started 12 years earlier. President Clinton wanted to be re-elected. He wanted to be popular. So, he changed the rules to make it easier to get loans. This made it easier for people to get loans they could not pay back. A reporter in the New York Times wrote about this in 1999. He said the government was pressuring a company called Fannie Mae to give loans to people who could not pay them back. He said this could cause big problems in the future.\n\nThe housing market was also very complicated. Banks were giving out loans that people could not pay back. They were selling these loans to other companies. This connected many parts of the economy to the housing market. Many people in America were borrowing too much money. When the housing market crashed, these people could not pay their loans. The companies that sold these bad loans had big problems.\n\nIn 2007, the top five big banks in America had $4.1 trillion dollars of bad loans. This was 30% of America's total economy. The government had to help some of these banks. The company Fannie Mae had $5 trillion dollars of bad loans. The government had to control it in 2008.",
            "Exposition is a part of a story where the writer tells the reader information about the characters and setting. But sometimes, too much exposition can be bad. It is like a long, boring speech that makes the reader want to fall asleep.\n\nDr. Merlin is a writer who knows about this problem. She calls it \"Too Much Information.\" She says it is like having a devil on the shoulder that tells you to tell too much about the story.\n\nExposition is when the writer tells the reader what happened. It is like a character in a movie saying, \"I'll tell you the whole story.\" In a book, the writer is the one telling the story.\n\nLet's look at an example. A writer might tell the reader that a main character met her husband, got married, and then he was killed. But that is not enough. The writer should show the reader how much the husband loved his wife and how much she loved him. This helps the reader become involved in the story and feel bad when the husband dies.\n\nThe writer should add \"meat\" to the story. This means giving the reader more information about the characters and what they feel. For example, the writer could show how the husband and wife fell in love and how they were happy together. This would make the reader sad when the husband dies.\n\nAs a writer, it is hard to resist telling too much information. But it is not good to rush past important details. For example, a writer might want to tell the reader that a character used to be in the Air Force, works at a gas station, and has certain dreams. But the writer should only include the information that is important to the story.",
            "I watched two news programs from Columbus, Ohio. The first one was on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The top story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who hurt his wife. He is named Shad Hostettler. The news showed his picture. He looked very bad. They spent two minutes on this story. They said he hurt his wife many times and he was arrested.\n\nThe next story was about a shooting in the Sharon Woods area. A man named Travis Buyers was shot. He is 18 years old. He is very sick. The police are looking for the person who did it. This story was short. I think it was short because the man who was shot is black. I have noticed that the news does not always talk about crimes when the victim is black.\n\nThe news also talked about a helicopter that was shot. They found a hole in it. The police think it was shot with a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. The police are looking for the person who shot the helicopter. They are offering a $5,000 reward for information that helps them catch the person.\n\nThe news also talked about the weather. They said it will be hot and rainy on Saturday. They said the temperature will be in the mid-80s all weekend.\n\nThe news also talked about a robbery at a store on Clime Road in Columbus. A black man with a hoodie robbed the store. He is tall and weighs about 150 pounds. They spent a lot of time saying the man was black.\n\nThe news also talked about a man named Rene Rodriguez. He was a big drug dealer in Texas. He was caught and sentenced to 25 years in prison. They said he was a Hispanic man. I do not think that was important to the story.",
            "There is a strong bond between brothers. This bond contains many emotions. These emotions include love, pride, anger, and sadness. Brothers understand each other better than anyone else. They can see themselves in their brother. When a situation is very bad, the true nature of this bond is clear. It can be good or bad. When brothers have strong feelings, there can be big costs. Understanding these feelings is hard. It means dealing with the bad things that come with them. When you look at a brother, you see your own reflection. You see yourself, not how others see you. Your actions and what happens because of them show your true character.\n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" shows this theme. Two brothers go on a difficult journey. They have strong feelings of anger and pride. In a big moment, they have a bitter fight. Only one brother survives. The story tells us about the feelings of the brothers through direct descriptions of the main character, Doodle, and his brother. It also tells us through the narrator's point of view. This point of view shows the main character's feelings about the world and how they affect his actions.\n\nThe main character feels one main emotion: pride. He wants a brother who can do things with him. He wants a brother to be his friend. But his little brother, Doodle, is sick. Doodle cannot do the things the main character wants him to do. The main character has angry feelings towards Doodle. He even thinks about hurting Doodle. But when Doodle smiles, the main character feels love. This shows that the main character's love for his brother is strong. He wants to take care of Doodle and make him happy.",
            "The human brain is a very complicated system. It helps us think and remember. Over time, people have used different ideas to explain how the brain works. \n- It was like a wax tablet at first.\n- Then it was like a piece of paper.\n- Then it was like a book.\n- Now it is like a computer.\n\nBut these ideas are not very useful. They can lead to wrong conclusions. \nThe brain gets information from our senses. Our senses are our eyes, ears, skin, and so on. They turn the world around us into signals that the brain can understand. The brain turns these signals into information that we can think about.\n\nThe brain uses two kinds of information processing. Bottom-up processing is like building a house. We start with small pieces and put them together to make something big. Top-down processing is like having a plan. We use what we already know to make something. For example, when we see a picture of a box, bottom-up processing helps us see that it is a box. Top-down processing helps us understand that it is a black box, not a hole.\n\nThe brain decides how important the information is. It also chooses which parts of the brain to use to think about it. This is called attention. For example, we can see many things when we look at the grass, but our brain does not make us think about them all. We might hear our name in a noisy room and understand what it means.\n\nThe brain has many stages of processing information. It also has different kinds of memory. We have sensory memory, working memory, and long-term memory. We store information and then we must keep it. There are different ways to store information, like seeing, hearing, or understanding. When we store information, we must keep it safe. Some research on animals shows that working memory is like a temporary signal that goes through the brain. Long-term memory is like a special kind of protein that helps us remember.\n\nWe have many ideas about how the brain organizes information. Some ideas come from how people remember things. Some ideas come from computers. Some ideas come from the way the brain works. One idea is that the brain is like a network. This network has many nodes, or points, that are connected. For example, the node for \"chair\" is connected to the node for \"table.\" The node for \"table\" is connected to the node for \"wooden.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley criticizes the dangers of technology and capitalism in his book Brave New World. In the story, people value community over individuality and are taught to be happy from a young age. But the people are not free. They are controlled by a powerful leader called the World Controller. This story is like a warning about the problems of capitalism. \n\nHuxley uses ideas from a man named Karl Marx. Marx said that people are trapped in a system where they do not understand their place in society. In Brave New World, the people are taught what to think and what to do. They do not think for themselves. This is called false consciousness. The people are busy thinking about their own happiness, not about what is good for them.\n\nThe lower classes in the story are not allowed to be different from the others. They are taught to consume and spend money, but they do not know that they are being controlled. The people in charge, like the World Controller, are in control of everything. They make the rules and the people follow them. This is called hegemony. The people at the top are born into their position and do not think about changing the system. They are happy with their place in society.\n\nIn the story, people do not have deep relationships with each other. They do not feel strong emotions like love. They talk about physical things, like how people look. The people in the story do not question their place in society. They are happy to follow the rules and do what they are told. This shows how capitalism can control people and make them do what they want. \n\nHuxley is warning us about the dangers of a society that values technology and capitalism over individual freedom and happiness. He is saying that if we are not careful, we will lose our freedom and become like the people in Brave New World.",
            "I am a student at University Park. I have been here for two and a half years. Getting around campus can be hard. My freshman year, I lived in a dorm room in East Halls, very far from the center of campus. To get to class in the Willard building, I had to walk 25 minutes. The weather was often bad, making it even harder.\n\nI talked to a friend who rides a bike. He said, \"Bikes are great. It's the best way to get around.\" Bicycling is good for your body and is the fastest way to travel. Eating a meal and biking can take you 30 miles or more.\n\nI now live off campus, far from the center of campus. Buying a bike was a smart choice. I go to class in the Thomas building every day. Walking would take 25 minutes. But biking takes only 5 minutes if I pedal fast.\n\nWalking has its advantages. But I am too busy to walk. If I didn't have a bike, walking would be my only way to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take 30-40 minutes. That's over two hours a week. I don't have time for that.\n\nI think the best solution for getting around campus is to use a bike. If students ride bikes and the campus is built for bicyclists, we can solve the problem of mobility."
