            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

Figured I'd go with the Division of Family and Children Services and help out those kids who've had a rough go of it, the ones who've been abused or forgotten.  I wanna lend a hand to families too, 'cause sometimes they just need a little extra support.  \n\nSee, for me, social work ain't just a job, it's a way of life. I've always wanted to help people, but I didn't know how 'til I figured out what I was good at.  I went to college and got my degree in Psychology, but I still felt like something was missing.\n\nThen one summer, I met this kid, just sixteen, sitting on my friend's couch lookin' like he'd seen a ghost. Turns out, he was runnin' from his parents, who weren't exactly the nicest folks. I didn't know what to do, but I knew I had to help. I talked to the cops, told 'em I was a psychology grad.  They asked me to talk to the parents 'cause they couldn't do much for the kid.  Man, those parents were somethin' else! They were all nervous and makin' excuses about their son bein' a manipulator. It was a wake-up call for me. That's when I knew I wanted to be a social worker, someone who could actually make a difference for kids like him.\n\nAnd let's talk about social justice, somethin' that's super important in this field.  Society always talks about how much it cares about individuals, but then it tries to cram everyone into the same mold.  Why can't we celebrate our differences instead of tryin' to be just like everyone else?  I've always been my own person, standin' up for what I believe in.

            "This piece is gonna break down the sleep-trouble thingy called insomnia, lookin' at why it happens. We'll check out two main ideas: what's going on inside ya (the biological stuff) and what's happening around ya (the sociocultural stuff).\n\nFirst off, let's talk about sleep problems in general. You got your main sleep trouble types: the ones that stand alone (like insomnia), the ones that come with other mental stuff (like anxiety or depression), and the ones caused by stuff like medical stuff or drugs.\n\nNow, insomnia is a real pain. It's when you can't fall asleep or stay asleep, and it's been bugging ya for at least a month. Then there are other sleep issues like oversleeping (hypersomnia) or narcolepsy, which is when ya suddenly fall asleep, even when you don't want to.\n\nSo, the \"what's inside ya\" idea says that genes and your body's insides play a big role. There's this part of your brain called the hypothalamus, which has special cells called orexins that tell you when to sleep and when to wake.\n\nOne study found that these orexin cells have something called GABAB receptors, which are like tiny switches that control sleep. When these switches are turned on, it makes you sleepy. But if they're messed up, well, that could be why you can't sleep!\n\nNow, the \"what's around ya\" idea says that your life stuff matters too. Your job, your family, your money – all that stuff can affect your sleep. Imagine if you're stressed out because you're worried about money or work – it's gonna be hard to sleep!",

Well, there are some red flags, like havin' trouble followin' conversations in a noisy place, mixin' up words, or missin' things when someone's talkin'. It's not that they're not listenin', it's just their brain's havin' a hard time sortin' out all the noise.\n\nNow, imagine you're a teacher in a regular classroom. What can ya do to help a kid with CAPD? Well, ya gotta be patient and creative.  Maybe try lettin' them sit closer to the front,  use visual aids, and break down instructions into smaller steps.  Remember, everyone learns differently, and with a little extra help, kids with CAPD can still succeed!",

But then you got South West Africa, which was a whole different story.  \n\nUnlike East Africa where the government built schools and stuff, in South West Africa, they left it all to the missionaries.  Those missionaries got some government support, but not much.  Meanwhile, the Germans were all about educating their own people, building fancy schools and supporting those missionary ones too.  This messed things up big time for South West Africa. While other colonies had tons of educated Africans, South West Africa was like, \"Nah, we good.\" Most folks there were still stuck in the dark ages, can't read, can't write, you know the drill.\n\nWhy the big difference?  Well, that's what this paper's all about.  We gotta dig into the whole settler scene and figure out what the bigwigs were thinking.  There's a ton of books about German schools, mostly written back in the day, but we need to take a closer look at what went on in South West Africa.  Some smart folks like Cohen have already compared South West Africa to East Africa and found some clues.  They think the big white population in South West Africa had a lot to do with it.\n\nSouth West Africa wasn't as hot and sweaty as some other colonies, but they still had a ton of desert.  And guess what?  More white folks wanted to live there! By 1913, almost 15,000 whites were calling South West Africa home, way more than any other colony.",
            "Man, music these days is wild! Like, there's so many different kinds of music now, it's crazy. Rock, pop, rap, country, jazz, folk—you name it, there's a genre for it. And get this, each of those genres has like, a million sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. It's like a never-ending musical family tree!\n\nBut let's talk about heavy metal, because that's where things get really interesting. That stuff's been around for ages, but it's exploded in the last 40 years. Heavy metal is all about feeling things, you know? And not the happy-go-lucky kind of feelings either. We're talking dark, intense emotions, the kind that make you wanna headbang until your head falls off. \n\nIt's also super diverse. People realized early on that heavy metal wasn't just one thing, it was a whole playground for creativity. So they started making their own sub-genres, then sub-sub-genres, and so on. \n\nNow it's like, what even IS heavy metal anymore? It's borrowed stuff from every other genre, but it still has that core, that dark, powerful energy.  \n\nTo understand heavy metal today, you gotta understand where it came from. It's more than just music, it's a movement. A movement fueled by darkness, loudness, and a whole lotta attitude.\n\nThink about it: more bass, more volume, more guitars screaming, more theatricality. It's like the music scene said \"screw subtlety\" and cranked everything up to 11.\n\nAnd yeah, let's not forget the drugs. The 70s were wild, man. All those psychedelics made people think differently, do different things, make different music. And heavy metal was born from that chaos.\n\nThey weren't afraid to explore the dark side of life, something that was kinda taboo in mainstream music back then. They drew inspiration from the Romantics, those poets who were all about intense feelings and dark themes.  \n\nEven the Beatles got in on the action. Their song \"Helter Skelter\" is a prime example. It's raw, it's chaotic, it's a glimpse into the darkness that was brewing.",
            "Alright, so picture this: before all those fancy Surrealist dudes were painting their crazy dreams, there was this guy, Henri Rousseau. He was like, way ahead of his time. This dude wasn't just painting dreams, he was *living* them, ya know? His famous painting, \"The Dream,\" from 1910, shows this lady totally blown away by the cool stuff she sees in her dream. But here's the kicker - it's also about Rousseau's own dreams, like, what he wanted out of life as an artist.  \n\nSee, he always wanted people to get his art, to be all \"WOW, this guy's amazing!\" But there was this big problem: he had this crazy fight going on inside his head. Should he paint like everyone else to get famous, or should he just do his own thing and be different? \"The Dream\" is like his big, messy answer to that question.\n\nNow, to understand what's going on, you gotta know a little about this guy. He was born way back in 1844 in a dusty French town. His dad was some kind of rich merchant, but Rousseau didn't get any fancy art training. He spent years working for the government, collecting taxes and stuff, until he was like, forty! Then, tragedy struck - his wife and almost all his kids died.  He decided to paint to escape his sadness and start fresh. Unlike those other artists who painted fancy pictures of peasants, Rousseau was a regular guy with regular dreams.\n\nRousseau really, really wanted to be a big deal in the art world.  He was starting late, and all these other artists were already famous. He was like, \"Hey, I'm good too!\" but nobody was listening.  This other artist, Matisse, was getting all the attention, and Rousseau was stuck in the shadows. This guy Gordon wrote a book about French art, and he said that Matisse was all about being different and unique, while Rousseau just wanted to paint something so normal that people would finally accept him.",
            "So, lotsa brainy folks, like, way smarter than me, think there's a super close link between being good and lookin' good, you know, like truth and beauty.  I kinda get it. Like, that poet Keats, he said somethin' like, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - that's all you need to know.\" \n\nWe learn stuff, right? Like, history, math, all that, but stuff like right and wrong, and what's pretty... that just feels different.  It's not like someone taught us to like a sunset or feel bad when someone's mean. It's just... there.\n\nThink about it. We can try to explain what makes art great or what makes somethin' right, but it's kinda hard to put it into words. You ever try to tell someone why you love a certain song? You might say somethin' about the beat, or the lyrics, but it ain't the whole story, ya know? There's just this... *something*\n\nSame with good stuff like kindness or honesty. We can talk about why it's important, but it's more than just words. It's like, deep down, you just *know* it's good.\n\nThat's why I think art and good stuff are connected.  They're both kinda magical, ya know? They move us in ways we can't always explain. It's like this feeling you get when you read a super good book, or see a painting that just blows you away. It's more than just pretty colors or a good story. It's somethin' deeper.",
            "So, lemme tell ya about Germany, alright? It's a powerhouse, a real unified crew, with its own crazy cool culture, from the Alps in München all the way to the Baltic Sea in Kiel.  You feel the same vibe from Köln on the Rhine to Dresden in Saxony by the Elbe.  It's a mix of all sorts of stuff, ya know?  \n\nSee, Germany's got a wild history, a whole bunch of different tribes and stuff that came together to make it what it is today.  Folks call this ancient land \"Germania,\" but where that name came from, well, that's a mystery even smarter folks than me can't solve. Tacitus, this old dude who wrote about Germans way back when, thought it came from a tribe called the Tungrians. They were called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and went head-to-head with the Gauls, ya see. (Tacitus, 98, get it?  Like, 98 AD!)  Then there's Julius Caesar, who, back in the day, used the word \"Germanus\" to talk about these pesky tribes he was fighting near the Rhine.  He nicked it from the Gauls, probably, a way to tell who he'd conquered and who he hadn't. Some think it was just a neighborly term in Gaulish, you know, like \"Hey, those Germans over there.\" (Names of Germany) Other folks say it came from the spear they used, called a \"ger,\" or maybe it meant \"shouty\" in some old language, 'cause Germans were known for being loud. (O.E.D, 2010, whatever that means).\n\nThis other Roman dude, Tacitus, wrote a book called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" way back in 98 AD. It's about where Germans came from, and he's like, \"These guys?  They're the real deal, no mixing with other folks, they just *were*.  Nobody would leave Asia or Africa for this wild, cold, grumpy place unless it was home, right?\" (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who'd want to leave Rome for Germania?  Not the Romans, not at first anyway.  But they'd send their guys out to get stuff and fight the occasional battle, but mostly, they went back to their big ol' empire.\n\nSo, these Germanic tribes, they were hanging out on the edge of Rome's land, trading their stuff and even fighting for Rome in their army.  (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17)",
            "Man, I was staring at this thing, my brain just kinda... empty. Not thinking, just seeing. Like, super focused but not really 'getting' it, y'know? Thoughts were popping in and out, but nothin' stuck. It was like my mind was just... flowing with what I was looking at.\n\nThis artist pal once told me to check out this book, \"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" or somethin'.  Always wanted to draw, ever since I was a kid, and this book was supposed to teach ya how, like, what a pencil is and how your brain even sees lines. \n\nOne trick in there is to picture a box around whatever ya lookin' at.  Like, say you've got a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen that's connected to a dining room, bam! Now it's just the bowl of fruit, simple as that.\n\nBut staring at this thing... I couldn't do it. It was just too much, too mind-blowing. Picasso had his blue stuff, Monet went crazy for green, Renaissance dudes loved all the colors.  My art was gonna be different, man, this was gonna be \"Work in Brown,\" the start of my masterpiece.\n\nSo I grabbed my tool, muscles gettin' tense and loose as I moved my hand, like, my mind was telling my hand what to do.  Water was swirlin', smooth and clear, and stuff was breakin' off and just... gone.  Muscles gettin' jumpy, I slammed the toilet handle again.  This brown thing wasn't budging, stuck like a bug on the bottom.\n\nMop in hand, feet apart, tie chokin' me, I frowned at this mess someone left for us bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of peaceful thinkin', then I grabbed the toilet paper, wrapped it around my hand like a giant oven mitt, and dove in. Just like a mom checkin' on the turkey in the oven...",
            "Yo, check this out.  Junior drivers are croakin' behind the wheel, man. It's a real bummer. Why? Well, the brainiacs at the National Institutes of Health say those teen brains ain't quite ready for the insanity of the road yet.  And, let's face it, they're green as grass. Not only do they cause more wrecks, but they're more likely to flip their cars, speed like crazy, and end up in the ditch.  \n\nTalk about a recipe for disaster!\n\nAnd get this, having your buddies in the car makes it even worse.  Some smarty-pants in California did a study and found that the more passengers a teen has, the more likely they are to crash.  Duh!\n\nSo, some states are tryin' to fix this mess by giving teens these temporary licenses that limit their driving time and how many friends can tag along.  But, honestly, that's just a band-aid on a gaping wound. The real problem is that teen drivers, statistically speaking, are just not cut out for the dangers of the road.  This psychologist dude, Marvin Zuckerman, thinks 18 is even too young to get a license.  He says teenagers are wired to take risks just for the rush, which, let's be real, is a bad combo with a steering wheel.  \n\nWe gotta delay driving until they're a little older, when they've calmed down and don't feel the need to live life on the edge.  Otherwise, we're gonna have a highway full of carnage.  Just you wait—the Baby Boomers' kids are gonna be hitting the road soon, and that's a whole lot of new drivers with questionable skills.\n\nHere's what we need: a national law that says no one under 18 can drive. Schools can still teach 'em about driving, but no keys until they're older.  We can still have those temporary permits and practice hours, but no exceptions.  That way, we can keep everyone safe.\n\nIt ain't rocket science, folks.",
            "So, I was digging through these old Edison movies at the Library of Congress, you know, the ones from way back when. I found fifteen of these \"trick films\" from between 1895 and 1901. These flicks, they're all about tricking your eyes with clever editing. Basically, I wanted to figure out how they made these tricks work and see if any of them got fancy later on. \n\nMost of the time, these early trick films were pretty simple. They were like little plays, all set up in front of a camera like a stage. No fancy camera moves, just straight-ahead shots of people doing their thing.  Think of it like a vaudeville show, but on film! You know, the audience always sees the whole picture at once, just like on a stage. \n\nThese tricksters mostly stuck to long shots or medium shots, never getting close-up on anyone's face.  They even kept the action limited to side-to-side movements  - no walking towards or away from the camera. Like in this film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" from 1900, the actors just walk back and forth, never leaving that stage-like area. \n\nAnd get this, each trick film was usually just one long shot, like a single scene.  They couldn't really tell a full story because they were so short. They were more like little magic tricks or gags, lasting maybe a minute or less. \n\nBut here's the kicker: what looks like one shot to us might actually be several shots spliced together to make the illusion work. Take \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" from 1895, for example.  If you watch closely, you'll see the moment where they switch out the \"head\" – it's like a hidden camera trick!",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya 'bout this dude John Taylor, real upstanding guy, straight outta Caroline. This fella was all about the Republican thing, ya know?  Didn't matter that he was a farmer, that life and his little stint in politics made him a real firebrand when it came to folks' freedom and how the government should run things. He was all about farms and stuff, thought it was the best job in the world, and that's what shaped his whole take on the government, the Constitution, even the courts.\n\nSee, John thought America had a shot at gettin' things right 'cause we didn't have no old traditions messin' things up. We could build somethin' new, somethin' based on people takin' care of themselves. He was a real believer in rights, the kind you're born with, that can't be touched by the government.  He figured if you mess with one right, they all start to crumble.  And he thought the idea of a \"state of nature\" where the strong just bulldoze the weak was a load of baloney. Civilization should be better than that.\n\nTo make this perfect society, John thought we needed a government that knew folks are a mix of good and bad. He was hard-line on that, thought we gotta be honest about it. He said,\"Government's run by people, so it's gonna have all the good and bad that comes with 'em.\"  He thought good government protected your stuff, helped farmers, and kept big businesses in check. He figured even if the people runnin' things were greedy, a good system would still work out fair.\n\nJohn believed folks are driven by self-interest, but it ain't always bad. It's only bad when it makes folks want to screw over others.  A good government keeps that in check.  He was all about the Constitution, but he didn't think just readin' the words was enough. You gotta understand what the guys who wrote it meant.  He thought the Declaration of Independence was even more important 'cause it made it clear America was a bunch of separate states, not just one big country.",
            "So, check it out. We were tracking how many folks were ditching their cars for bikes or walking or whatever, right? But in month three, bam!  The numbers nosedived like a cheetah on roller skates. Kinda bummer, ya know?\n\nWinter hit New England, so maybe folks just stopped biking and walking as much.  Plus, December is crazy busy with school stuff ending and holidays kicking in.  People are probably too swamped with exams and gift-wrapping to remember to fill out those log sheets. \n\nThen, December turned into January, and everyone was on break. Like, no one even needs to be on campus! Then classes start up again in January, and, guess what? Still low numbers! \n\nYou know how it is, things get hyped up at first, then people kinda lose steam.  We tried to pump things up with a \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, and it worked! More people started logging their commutes.  \n\nBut here's the deal - keeping people interested when there's a natural lull, plus those big school breaks, is tough.  \n\nAnother thing? People love their cars. It's like, built into our brains! So, to get them to ditch the wheels, you gotta give 'em good reasons. \n\nWe gave away cool stuff like gift cards to local places – restaurants, coffee shops, even massages!  I wonder if something bigger, like a sweet bicycle or even a hybrid car, would have made a bigger splash.\n\nWe kept the prizes the same the whole time. Maybe if we'd upped the ante as things went on – maybe a couple bikes in December, then a hybrid or electric car in January – things might have stayed super pumped.",
            "Hold onto your hats, folks! Today we're diving deep into the wild world of ETFs, those fancy financial instruments that track stuff like stock indexes or even whole baskets of assets. Think of them like index funds, but way more flexible, like a stock you can buy and sell on the open market.  \n\nThese bad boys give you the best of both worlds: the spread-out protection of an index fund and the cool perks of owning individual stocks, like short selling, margin trading, and snagging just one share at a time. Oh, and did I mention they're usually cheaper to own than your average mutual fund? Talk about a win-win!\n\nBut hold up! There's always a catch, right? Well, with ETFs, you gotta cough up a commission every time you buy or sell, just like with regular stocks.  And while they offer a ton of choices, it's always smart to double-check if those benefits, like diversification, are really delivering the goods.\n\nToday, we're putting a popular ETF called IHF under the microscope. We're gonna compare it to its top ten holdings, which make up a whopping 63.58% of the whole shebang. These top dogs are like the VIPs of the ETF world, so if we understand them, we're halfway to understanding the whole crew.\n\nWe're gonna see if owning just these ten stocks would be just as good, or even better, than owning the whole IHF ETF.  Plus, we'll see if we can find a better way to mix and match these ten stocks to get even better returns, like a financial magic trick!  \n\nFirst, we'll crunch some numbers to figure out how these ten stocks contribute to the overall return and risk (or Beta) of the ETF. Then, we'll see if these two portfolios - the ETF and the top ten - are truly different, or just playing a game of chance. Stay tuned, folks, it's gonna be a wild ride!",
            "Alright, so check it out, this poem \"Dream-Land\" by Poe, he thinks it's pretty rad. Now, Poe uses this word \"Thulé\" a couple times, and some dude named Mabbott figured out it comes from this old dude Virgil. Virgil used it for this island way up north, like beyond the edge of the known world, ya know?  Virgil totally used it, but there's this other dude, Goethe, who Poe was digging big time. This Karl J. Arndt guy, he wrote a whole book about Poe and Goethe's poems, and he reckons Poe was basically copying Goethe.\n\nGoethe, man, he was a big deal. Wrote this epic poem called \"Faust,\" two parts, way back in the day.  Part two has this poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It's about this king whose wife kicks the bucket after giving him this goblet. He starts drowning his sorrows in booze, missing his queen like crazy.  Then he's all, \"Screw this,\" decides to join his wife, gives his stuff to his kids, except for the goblet, walks to a cliff, tosses the goblet in the ocean, closes his eyes, and bam! Dead. Pretty messed up, right?  \n\nSo, the King of Thulé and the dude in Poe's poem, they're kinda like mirror images, like Poe's own messed up feelings bottled up in this poem.  There was even this play version of Faust in 1842,  just before Poe used \"Thulé\" in his other poem, \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" \n\nPoe uses \"Thulé\" twice in his poems, like bookends, but \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land,\" they're like buddies. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about how dark and lonely Thulé is, haunted by dead friends, everything's gray and depressing. Sounds a lot like how the King of Thulé feels after his wife dies, right? \n\nGoethe was a big deal, and Poe would have known him, even if it was just because he liked Tennyson. Plus, Goethe's stuff was everywhere back then.",
            "Okay, lemme tell ya about this crazy case I heard about. So there's this lady, Jennifer, right? She slipped and fell on some spilled applesauce in a grocery store called D&D. Ouch! Turns out, the manager, Paul, knew about the mess 'cause two employees told him about it. But guess what? He was too busy eating dinner!  Thirty minutes passed and BAM! Jennifer goes down!  \n\nNow, Jennifer's lawyer wants to go after Paul big time with \"punitive damages\". That means like, extra money to punish him 'cause they think he was super reckless. See, in California, you can get those if someone acts really bad on purpose, or just plain stupid and doesn't care if someone gets hurt. And in this case, they think Paul fits the bill.  \n\nThey're going to argue that Paul knew this store was a slip-and-slide! Apparently, there'd been five other falls that year already! But nope, he still wouldn't clean it up.  \n\nIt's a bit of a stretch to say he was \"despicable,\" but hey, it's California, anything goes!  They're gonna try to convince the judge that Paul was playing with fire and Jennifer got burned. \n\nTheir story goes like this:  It was a Friday afternoon, 5 p.m. sharp.  One of Paul's guys, Rich, tells him about the applesauce. Paul's like, \"Dude, I'm on a break, go away!\" Then another employee, Mary, tries to warn him again, and guess what? Same response!  \n\nFinally, at 5:30, poor Jennifer slips and falls, and ouch, she really hurt her back. So now she's suing D&D for all the money they can get.  It's gonna be a showdown in court!",
            "Man, lemme tell ya, four years ago I took this Islam class at CBC, and let me tell ya, things got heated! We were debating whether Islam was a bad religion or not, and it feels even more important today than ever. It's crazy how things have changed since 9/11.  I mean, back then the media was all over Islam, sayin' it was bad news, and now it's like everyone loves it!  Heck, we even got a president named Barack Obama, who's got Muslim roots, can you believe it?!\n\nNow, this book about Muhammad's life, it got me thinkin'. See, I thought Muhammad was a tough guy, conquering tribes and forcing them to become Muslims, but this book paints him as this misunderstood martyr, a humble dude who people just naturally flocked to. It's kinda strange, like they're trying to make him look like some kinda Jesus figure.\n\nAnd get this, there are some crazy similarities between Jesus and Muhammad. Like, there's this story where Muhammad turns some mutton and milk into enough food for forty guys!  It's like they're tryin' to make Muhammad look like some kinda miracle worker, which, you know, kinda steals thunder from Jesus, if you ask me.\n\nThe book's full of stories about people converting to Islam, but a lot of them come from, like, second or third hand accounts. It's all \"so-and-so told me, who heard it from so-and-so.\" It makes you wonder how true it all really is.\n\nThe thing that bugs me the most is how they try to make Muhammad out to be this perfect, gentle guy. But history tells a different story, man! He wasn't exactly Mr. Nice Guy. I gotta wonder if Muslims today even know the real story about how Muhammad got his power.",
            "Whoa, man, listen up!  So, you know how Jesus taught his stuff, right?  Well, after he, like, disappeared, Christianity went totally off the rails!  It's like, they added all this extra junk over time, making it way different from the original deal.  \n\nThese days, everyone's all about change and progress, ya know?  The old-school folks, they cling to what they know, but they're not gonna be able to stop the tide.  People are gonna start figuring out what was really important to Jesus, and ditch all the extra stuff.\n\nIt might take a while, maybe decades, maybe centuries, but it's gonna happen. Christianity's gonna go back to its roots, stripping away all the layers, like turning back time!  Eventually, we'll be worshipping just like they did back in Jesus' day, following only his teachings.\n\nThe churches will still be there, but everything will be way more unified.  No more different groups, no more arguments, just everyone on the same page.  Think of it like history reversing itself.  Remember how Christians used to get persecuted?  Then the Romans became Christian themselves!  Or how slavery ended and African-Americans rose to power?  \n\nThis big shift in Christianity is gonna be just like that.  It'll go back to the source, back to what Jesus really taught, and it'll bring everyone together.  The key is understanding that Jesus' words were meant metaphorically, not literally.  \n\nSo, what happened after Jesus?  Well, before Jesus, there was Judaism, the starting point for it all.  The Jews believed in one God, had scriptures they considered divinely inspired, and they were all about that religious authority.",
            "Man, lemme tell ya about this book, \"The Jungle.\" It's like, a real eye-opener about how messed up people can get when they're all about money and power. I mean, these factory owners, they're like, obsessed with makin' their businesses bigger and richer, no matter who they step on along the way. They're practically demons, those guys.\n\nTake a look at this line from the book: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\".  It's like Upton Sinclair is sayin', \"Yo, look at this pollution! It's outta control!\"  These owners, they don't even care about the air we breathe or the animals gettin' hurt. They're like, \"more profit, more profit!\"  \n\nAnd forget about the workers, man. They're just pawns in this whole game. The owners squeeze 'em dry, makin' 'em work crazy hours, and then BAM! They're out on the street with nothin'. No warning, no nothin'. They don't even get a \"thank you\" for all their hard work.  Back then, there were no rules or nothin' to protect these poor dudes. They were stuck in a system that was rigged against 'em.\n\nIt's like they're slaves, man.  Sinclair even says, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"  Harsh, right?\n\nSo yeah, \"The Jungle\" shows how greedy and selfish humans can be when they're chasin' after money. It's a real wake-up call.",
            "So, you see, some writers are real slick, they use tricks to make you *feel* somethin' about stuff, ya know? Like, they pair words together that wouldn't normally hang out, just to make ya think a certain way. Or they pick symbols, like colors, and give 'em a secret meaning, then use 'em to make ya remember that feeling every time you see 'em. F. Scott Fitzgerald, the guy who wrote *The Great Gatsby*, he's a master of this stuff.\n\nHe does this whole thing with colors, like gold, green, white, gray, and even red and pink. He builds up this meaning, like a secret code, and then uses those colors to remind ya of that feeling later on.\n\nTake white and gray, for example. Fitzgerald uses these colors a lot, and he makes them mean somethin' special. White, it's like, fancy and all that, while gray is kinda old and faded. He throws these colors around everywhere at the start of the story. Daisy and Jordan, they're always dressed in white, like it's the only color they know. Even Nick, he's wearing white flannels at Gatsby's party, and Tom's got a white shirt on when he meets Myrtle. It's like everyone's wearin' white, and the only time they're not is when Nick's getting a vibe from Gatsby's party, and then it's all these crazy colors, like red and blue, nothin' fancy.\n\nThen Fitzgerald keeps throwin' white and gray at ya, like when Nick goes to work, he goes down \"white chasms,\" or when Gatsby's party guests are just \"gray names\" to Nick. Even places are white or gray, like the apartment buildings, the cars, the land, even people like that gray old dog-seller.\n\nSo, after you've seen white and gray everywhere, Fitzgerald uses 'em to show ya somethin' ain't important, or kinda boring. He uses this with Daisy, too. After a while, he describes her in all white, and suddenly, she doesn't seem so special anymore. She's just another white thing, somethin' Gatsby wants but ain't really real. He keeps doin' this with Daisy, makin' her seem like she's just a part of the pattern, not a real person.",

Tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers - they grow it all! And get this, people are going crazy for organic food here. Like, seriously, there are tons of farms selling it straight to folks, and they have waiting lists longer than my arm!  Organic eggs and milk are the faves, too.  \n\nThese organic farms are pretty cool. They give tours, let you hike around, birdwatch, the whole shebang. It's like a win-win: farmers get to be all green and stuff, and people get to learn about where their food comes from. Plus, they get government help for doing it, which is pretty sweet.\n\nNow, here's the thing about organic farming. It's awesome for the environment because it keeps the soil and water clean, which makes all sorts of plants and critters happy. But it's also a bit more work.  It takes extra effort to keep those pesky bugs and weeds away without chemicals, and sometimes you lose more crops. It's like trying to build a castle out of marshmallows - it looks great, but it might not be as strong as a regular brick one.  \n\nThen there are all these other things farmers do to help wildlife, like planting special plants, letting animals graze in different spots, and keeping those nasty invasive plants in check. All that extra work adds up, so it's no wonder farmers sometimes need a little help to make ends meet and keep the wildlife happy.\n\nSo, I found this cool piece of land near a town called Potrero. It's got all sorts of stuff growing on it - chaparral, grass, and oak trees - and it's right next to a big forest.  Lots of animals live there, some even endangered ones like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog.\n\nThis land has a cool history. Native Americans lived there for ages, then ranchers came along and raised cattle and chopped down trees for firewood.  It's been around for a long time, and now someone could make it into an awesome organic farm.\n\nI found a real farm doing this kind of stuff nearby and checked out what kind of help the government offers.  It's pretty inspiring to see people working hard to grow good food and protect nature at the same time.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya somethin' 'bout culture, see?  It's like, way more than just what ya see on the surface. It's like, a whole vibe, y'know? Ain't no two cultures exactly alike, and sayin' somethin' like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are nice\" is just plain wrong.  It's like, yeah, there might be some truths there, but everyone's different, right?  The real deal is to get a feel for what makes a culture tick, how it plays into the deal, and how their way of thinkin' might affect things. \n\nWhen you're dealin' with folks from a different place, you're gonna see it through your own lens, and that's natural. But tryin' to understand 'em means lookin' at their history, their beliefs, their whole deal. You gotta respect it, even if it's different from your own. Especially if you're the one with less to bargain with, ya know?  It's like, if you're walkin' into their turf, show 'em some respect, understand their rules, and things'll go smoother.\n\nNow, culture ain't just 'bout countries.  Even within a country, companies have their own vibes. Some are all about workin' hard, others are chill.  You can tell by how folks dress, how they talk, who they trust to do what.  Some companies encourage helpin' out, others are all about stickin' to the rules. Just look at all the different ways American companies operate, even in the same city.  And some cultures, they might seem more uniform at first, but that just means you gotta dig deeper, y'know?\n\nValues, that's the real key. They're like, the reason behind everything. If a culture values lookin' good or keepin' the peace, they ain't gonna embarrass themselves or their boss just to win a deal.  If they value a tough bargain, they ain't gonna give up easy.  So, before you sit down at the table, get a feel for those values. \n\nBut here's the thing:  gettin' to know the other guy personally can make a big difference too.  It's like, understand their values, but also, who they are.  That's how you make a real connection and get a good deal.",
            "Alright, lemme break this down for ya. So, these two brainiacs, St. Anselm and St. Thomas, both think God's the real deal. They're like, \"Yo, God exists!\" But they go about proving it in totally different ways. Anselm's all, \"Look inside yourself, dude! God's already there, man! You just gotta know it!\" He's sayin' that faith, like, knowing somethin' without proof, is the key. Kinda like trustin' your gut, ya know? \n\nThen there's Thomas, who's like, \"Nah, man, we need evidence! We gotta use our smarts!\"  He lays out five reasons why God's gotta be real, like pieces of a puzzle, ya dig?  He's all about logic and facts.\n\nNow, both these guys make some good points, but neither one, like, totally knocks it outta the park. \n\nIt's kinda like this: Anselm's sayin' faith is enough, but can you really trust somethin' you can't see or touch? And Thomas is like, \"Show me the proof!\" but where do you even start lookin' for proof of somethin' bigger than everything? It's a head-scratcher, man.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this dude, Buddha. He was born way back, like, way back in the day, like the 5th or 6th century BCE. This cat was a prince, but he went all zen and ditched the fancy life. He got super enlightened and started preachin', and his teachings became this thing called Buddhism. There's a bunch of different kinds of Buddhism, but the oldest one is called Theravada.  It's been around for like, 2500 years, and things have changed a bit since Buddha was around. Like in Sri Lanka, they got this water-cutting thing they do every year. Monks and regular folks do it, and it's kinda religious, even though Buddha never said nothin' about it.  It's like that, man, all kinds of stuff has changed, from the small stuff to the big stuff, the core stuff. The Theravada Buddhist peeps, both the monks and the regular folks, have had to tweak their beliefs over time. It's like, stuff happens, ya know? \n\nNow, listen up, 'cause we gotta talk about some special words. We're gonna use \"internal\" and \"external\" a lot. An internal force is somethin' that comes from inside the Buddhist crew, doesn't matter if you're a monk or not. An external force is anything from folks outside Buddhism. A hostile force is somethin' that wants to mess with Buddhism, like, hurt it or somethin'. A benign force is just chillin', not tryin' to help or hurt, but it might end up doin' one or the other by accident. We'll be usin' these words a lot, so pay attention.\n\nFirst things first, let's break down the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find safety in the \"triple gem\"—Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha.  Dhamma is like the teachings, all written down in a bunch of books called the Tripitaka. You got the Sutta Pitaka, which is all the Buddha's sayings, the Vinaya Pitaka, which is like the rule book for monks, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which is all the deep, philosophical stuff. They talk about things like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (life is suffering), and Anicca (everything changes).  Gettin' all this stuff down is how you escape Sansara, which is like this endless cycle of bein' born and dying. Along with Sansara, you gotta get rid of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). Only then can you become enlightened.  The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for everyone, but the monks have a lot more. Regular folks gotta follow the five precepts: don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't be a jerk in love, and don't get wasted.  \n\nThe big idea in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, life is suffering (Dukkha). Second,  attaching to stuff causes suffering. Third, you can get rid of suffering. Fourth, there's a path to end suffering, which is called the Eightfold Path.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about these two countries, the U.S. and Mexico. They used to be at each other's throats, like, for a super long time, 57 years, from way back in 1836 to 1893. It was a real showdown, kinda like when Mack sends those goofy robot dudes after us. \n\nBack in 1846, things really kicked off with the Mexican-American War. The U.S. went and stomped all over Mexico, snagged Texas and the Southwest, and basically said, \"This is ours now!\" \n\nBut it wasn't just one big fight, ya know? There were a bunch of smaller skirmishes and arguments along the way. They couldn't see eye-to-eye on stuff like religion, culture, and who owned what. It's kinda like when Camo and Katt argue over who gets to use the TV remote.\n\nThis whole neighbor rivalry thing happens a lot, ya know? Countries that live near each other often butt heads over stuff. It's like when you have a sibling, you're always fighting over something, right? \n\nThe U.S. and Mexico were like that, except on a much bigger scale. This dude Pletcher said that Mexico and Cuba were the only countries that really gave the U.S. a hard time diplomatically, and I guess that makes sense because they're right next door. Other countries in Latin America? Not so much.\n\nReligion was a big deal too. Americans back then weren't too keen on Catholicism, kinda like how Sa2b freaks out when he sees a spider. It all went back to the old days, when the English and Spanish were constantly at odds.  \n\nThose 57 years had a ton of drama, like 17 different disputes!  Most of it was about border stuff, with bandits and outlaws causing trouble on both sides. It wasn't until both countries decided to crack down that things calmed down a bit.\n\n\nEventually, Mexico realized they needed the U.S. for stuff, and the U.S. shifted its focus from taking over land to, well, meddling in Mexico's economy. That's how the rivalry finally died down.",
            "Fifteen years back, bam! I got hit with a nasty illness outta nowhere.  Didn't even know it existed!  See, I was a nurse, always thought that was the safest bet. \"You'll always have a job, people gotta get sick, right?\" That's what everyone kept sayin'. So, even though I dreamed of being a scientist or a journalist, maybe both, I stuck with nursing.  \n\nBut here I was, 46, single, with nothin' saved up and no way to work. Still disabled fifteen years later, livin' on Social Security, and lemme tell ya, I've got nothin' to call my own anymore.  Every day's a struggle, a fight just to feel safe and good about myself.   nothin's for sure anymore, except for one thing: I wouldn't have made it without my family and a few real good friends. Believe me, when disaster hits, you don't feel so tough.\n\nLife throws curveballs, big and small, no matter how prepared you are.  Sometimes you need a hand. I get that we shouldn't rely on the government for everything, but wouldn't it be better if we learned to trust each other again? Help each other out, ask for help when we need it. Instead of building our own little bunkers, maybe we should be building each other up.\n\nThose conservatives talk about \"rugged individualism\" building this country, but it was compassion, respect, and sharing that got our ancestors through tough times. Those pioneers crossing the Rockies didn't do it alone, they relied on each other. \n\n\nSo, yeah, be prepared. I am. I got my emergency kit, first aid stuff, water tablets, and even plastic sheeting for a bio attack. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, canned goods, the whole shebang. If you got the space, grow your own food.  Get a wood stove, if you can.  \n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors. You never know when you might need 'em.",
            "Alright, so how come critters end up looking the way they do?  Is there some kinda rulebook for evolution, ya know?  Back in the day, this guy D'Arcy Thompson, way back in 1917,  said something like, \"Even today, scientists are just starting to figure out how to describe even the simplest creatures with math.\" And guess what? That's still kinda true!  But,  people are gettin' better at using math to figure out how shells grow,  like in those fancy clam things called mollusks.  We're trying to do the same thing with these cool snails called Prunum. We're using  math models and, like,  actual experiments to see how these snails change over time, and why they look the way they do.\n\nThink of a shell like a tube that's always on the move, spiraling around and around. Each twist is called a whorl, and it's all wrapped around this imaginary line called the columella, kinda like the center of the spiral. The size of each whorl can change, and the lines between them are called sutures. Usually, the biggest whorl is the last one, the one that's kind of like the \"belly\" of the snail.  All the other whorls make up the spire,  and the very tip is called the apex.\n\nYou can look at a shell in different ways, like from the top, the bottom, the opening, or even the opposite side of the opening.  \n\nTo count the whorls, you gotta look at it from the top, find the first suture, and draw a line. Then, count all the whorls from that line, even if they're just a little bit there.\n\nBasically, a shell is like a bunch of tiny doors opening up as the snail grows.  We can track these doors across space and time to see how the snail built its shell. We can even use math to figure out how the snail made its shell!  With enough math, we can change things up and see how the snail would look if it grew differently.",
            "Alright, so listen up!  Indonesia's doin' alright, ya know? They're crushin' it with the water and sanitation stuff, gettin' close to those Millennium Development Goals. But when it comes to takin' care of moms and babies, they're fallin' behind.  Like, way behind. It's like, \"Hey, we got clean water, but your kid's, like, dyin' from diarrhea.\"  Makes ya scratch your head, right?\n\nSee, they're sayin' more moms are havin' babies with those fancy \"skilled workers\" around. But here's the kicker: some of these \"skilled workers\" are just midwives, not doctors.  So, yeah, they're makin' progress, but not the kinda progress that saves lives.\n\nAnd they're not doin' so hot with kids either.  Fewer and fewer kiddos are gettin' help when they're sick, and postnatal care?  Forget about it!  It's practically non-existant.\n\nNow, here's the real doozy:  Cesarean sections are way down, like, only 4%. That's low, man, way too low. It's even worse in the country, only 2% compared to 7% in the city.  It's like they're forgettin' about the people who need it most. And the really messed up part? The poor folks, they're strugglin' to even get healthcare.  They're gettin' left behind.\n\nSo, what's the solution?  Should they build more programs or just fix the whole healthcare system? You gotta hand it to the programs, they're quick and easy.  But here's the downside: programs often suck the money and people away from other important stuff.  It's like, \"Hey, we got this HIV program, everyone go there!\"  While other stuff gets ignored.\n\nPlus, when you got a bunch of different programs runnin' around, it gets messy.  You got paperwork everywhere, supplies gettin' lost, and nobody knows what's goin' on.",
            "So, these Victorian books, they're all about fancy stuff and rich people, right?  But then you got these two books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" they're like, \"Nope, forget that!\" They're all about mysteries and weird stuff, which wasn't really a thing back then.  It makes the characters way more interesting, 'cause you get to see what's really going on in their heads.\n\nLike, take Oliver, he's got all these crazy dreams, like he's back with those mean guys, Sikes and Crackit, arguing and stuff. Then BAM!  Gunshots, chaos, lights flashing, he's being dragged away. It's all super confusing and scary, and you can tell Oliver's hurting, both physically and mentally.\n\n\nBoth of these books use dreams and crazy stuff to show us what's really going on inside the characters.  In \"Oliver Twist,\" Oliver's dreams are like windows into his soul, showing us what's bothering him and how he's feeling about everything that's happening. When he gets shot, he has this flashback, like a dream, where he relives the whole thing.  He's trapped, he can't control anything, and all he feels is pain. It's like the world is against him, and he's just a helpless pawn.  It makes you wonder, who's really in charge of his life?  And it makes you feel sorry for him, 'cause he's just a kid trying to survive in a cruel world. \n\n \"Wuthering Heights\" does the dream thing too, but it's a bit more...intense.  It's all about secrets and hidden feelings, and the dreams are like these creepy little glimpses into the characters' dark side.",
            "A couple years back, I was workin' at this after-school program, you know, helpin' out those little elementary kids with their schoolwork. I was pretty good at English and readin', so that's mostly what I stuck to. One day, I got roped into helpin' this little dude named Adrian, I think he was in third or fourth grade, couldn't read worth a lick. Now, this kid, he speaks perfect English,  but somethin' just wasn't right. He'd nail some letters, then completely butcher others, super weird, ya know? I figured he was Latino, but maybe his English was new to him.  We struggled for ages, until one day, Adrian's mom showed up.  Now, she didn't speak a lick of English, just Spanish.  I was tryin' to piece together what she was sayin' with my super rusty Spanish (I was just learnin' back then).  Then it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read fine, he just wasn't familiar with the English alphabet!  I don't know if it made a difference in the long run, but I hope that fella's doin' alright.\n\nSee, that story's why I gotta talk about this whole language barrier thing in schools, especially here in California. It ain't always as obvious as it seems. Even if a kid speaks perfect English, readin' it can still be a major pain.  Everybody knows this problem exists, so what's the deal? For Adrian, it was simple:  tutorin' on English readin', focusin' on the alphabet and sounds. But for kids who barely speak English, it's a whole other ball game. There ain't just one answer, ya know? Dual language programs, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes... none of 'em work miracles on their own. You gotta mix and match!\n\n\nFirst off, dual language programs are a great idea, not just for Spanish speakers, but for everybody! Studies show kids in these programs do better in school.  Some folks get all scared and say it wastes resources and most kids won't benefit.  But that's hogwash! If we made these programs the norm instead of the exception, everyone would be better off. But how do we do it? Make every teacher bilingual?  Nah, that's crazy talk. But we could definitely have bilingual helpers, tutors, you get the idea.",
            "Ok, so picture this: everyone's always talkin' about somethin' big out there, somethin' way bigger than us. Like, duh, right? Some folks go to church, others hit up the temple, some even try to figure it all out on their own. A lot of us just go with what our folks taught us, ya know? But then there are those who say \"Nope, ain't nothin' out there but me!\" They think the world revolves around 'em. Kinda selfish, if you ask me.  Anyway, we all find our own way, tryin' to figure out what makes us tick, what gives our lives meaning. We're lookin' for that spark, somethin' to guide us outta the darkness and into the sunshine.\n\nMy old man, he loved cardinals.  We were sittin' on the porch one day, rain comin' down like crazy, poundin' on the roof. It was like the whole world was drownin'.  He was lookin' out at the rain, all lost in thought. He'd gotten real skinny and his clothes were hangin' off him like he'd shrunk. His hair was thinner too, like the wind had blown it all away. He wouldn't look at me, just stared out at the storm. I felt kinda lost, scared, like I couldn't talk to him about how much I was gonna miss him 'cause sayin' it out loud would make it real. So I just hugged him, moved my chair closer, and we sat there together, watchin' the rain.\n\nHe died that December, five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation didn't really help, just kept him hangin' on longer than the doctors thought.  I couldn't figure out what good that did, y'know? Seemed like a kinda cruel thing for God to do, if He even existed. I didn't pray that night. If God was really listenin', He'd stopped a long time ago.\n\nI didn't wanna see him go, so I didn't. Couldn't stand watchin' the man who made me slip away.  I wanted to remember him how he was, not how he died.  Besides, I knew my dad better than anyone else did, even his own family. I knew he wouldn't want me there, watchin' him fade away. I just curled up in bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called.",
            "Alright, so, get this – the whole \"Gothic Novel\" thing is kinda like a crazy mix-up, right? It's old stuff, but it's also brand new! This guy, Ian Watt, he says it's like an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" which basically means it's a total head-scratcher. People have been talking smack about it, praising it to the heavens, saying it's shallow, then praising its spooky awesomeness.  \n\nSee, this dude Horace Walpole, he wrote the first real Gothic Novel, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" and he mixed up old-school plays with all this nature stuff that was super trendy back then. He called it a \"Gothic Story,\" and BAM! He started a whole new way of writing. \n\nGothic stuff is all about bringing back the spooky vibes of old castles, plays, and legends. When Walpole wrote his thing, people already used \"Gothic\" for all sorts of stuff, like talking about ancient people or whatever. It was like saying something was old-fashioned and not cool compared to the \"modern\" stuff everyone was into.\n\nBut here's the kicker – Gothic novels kinda became a big deal because they had these old-school spooky vibes, but they also let you get into the heads of the characters, which was new and exciting. It's like they're both super old and totally fresh at the same time!\n\nOne of the big ideas in Gothic novels is this whole \"Chivalry\" thing. Think knights in shining armor, brave and honorable, you know? Gothic writers loved talking about chivalry because it was like a reminder of how things used to be, and they thought people weren't as knightly anymore.  \n\nWalpole, he was writing during a time when things were super messed up politically, and he was worried about the future. Maybe he thought the good ol' days were better, back when knights were around. In his story, you see this knightly character named Frederic, who's described as the perfect knight, almost too perfect. He's a prince, he's sad because of some tragedy, and he's supposed to be dead.",
            "Okay, so picture this: you order somethin' online, right?  Like, a new pair of shoes or somethin'.  That order kicks off this crazy chain reaction, like a domino effect, but with stuff instead of dominoes. That's what we call \"Supply Chain Management\", and it's how stuff gets from the raw materials to your doorstep faster than you can say \"Amazon Prime!\"\n\nThis dude named Keith Oliver, back in 1982, came up with the term. He was all about gettin' stuff to customers quick and easy, like a ninja of logistics.\n\nHere's the lowdown: there are six main parts to this whole supply chain thing. We got: \n\n* **Production:** This is where the magic happens!  It's like buildin' a spaceship, but instead of rockets, we're talkin' products. Managers gotta figure out what folks want, how much they want, and where to build it all. Kinda like a super-organized puzzle. \n* **Supply:** Now we gotta get the ingredients for our spaceship, right? That's where supply comes in.  Managers gotta decide who's gonna make what, and if we should team up with other companies. Outsourcing, they call it. It's like gettin' your buddy to help you build your spaceship. \n* **Inventory:** Gotta keep track of all those shiny parts, right?  That's inventory.  Too much, and it takes up space; too little, and we're outta luck. Managers gotta find that sweet spot. \n* **Location:** Where do we build this spaceship, anyway?  Managers gotta pick the best spot for production, thinkin' about stuff like shipping costs and how close it is to customers. \n* **Transportation:** How do we get our spaceship from the factory to the customer? Trucks, trains, planes, maybe even a magic carpet?  Managers gotta figure out the best way to move stuff around. \n* **Information:** This is the brains of the operation.  Managers need to know everything about the whole process, from how much stuff we have to where it's going. Think of it like a giant, interconnected web of data.\n\nIt's a lot to keep track of, but if everything's run smoothly, we get our shiny new spaceship – er, I mean product – delivered right to our door!",
            "Alright, so there's this chick, Ellen, you know, the one from that Juno movie?  She's standing on a street corner, holding up this cardboard sign with some crazy stuff written on it.  It says, \"Hitler is alive in Burma!\"  Now, Burma, that's like this place in Southeast Asia, right?  It's run by these super mean guys who kinda took over back in '62, like a total power grab.  A few years back, these monks, all dressed in saffron robes, started protesting.  They called it the \"Saffron Revolution,\" get it? Anyway, things got really heated, the government wasn't happy, and they started messing with the monks.  Journalists got thrown in jail, one guy even got killed just for taking pictures! It's like, totally messed up.\n\nThis isn't a new thing, though.  It's like, governments have always wanted to control everything, right?  Like back in Rome, the emperors acted like they were gods, bossing everyone around.  And don't even get me started on Japan, they think their emperors are, like, actual gods!  And here in America, our president, well, let's just say he talks to some interesting people.\n\nThen there's stuff like what happened in Tiananmen Square back in '89.  A bunch of students and intellectuals just wanted to speak up, but the government got all violent.  They say only a couple hundred people died, but others say it was thousands! And then there's the Rwandan genocide, where people were killed just because of who they were.  And of course, you can't forget Hitler and the Nazis.  They were all about killing anyone they didn't like.\n\nIt's just, like, sad and scary, you know?",
            "So, check it out, this dude Duke Ellington, right? He's a big deal in the jazz world. He stuck around for ages, which means he got super good at making his band sound awesome.  You know, he doesn't always play piano super loud in his songs, but as a composer, he was a total genius. He wrote these crazy complex tunes that let each musician shine. He'd build a framework where soloists could go wild, but also make these tight, organized sections that showed off each player's style.  He knew how to make the whole band sound like one big, awesome machine.\n\nThis one dictionary, The Grove Music Dictionary, says Ellington was always using his singers like instruments.  They talk about a song called \"Creole Love Call\" where he does this thing where the singer just makes sounds, like a totally new kind of instrument. It's like, forget the words, it's all about the feeling.  And he was always making sure the singers and the instruments worked together perfectly, which is pretty cool.\n\n\"Creole Love Call\" is this slow, bluesy song with six parts, each one different.\n\n* **Part 1:**  The singer and the wind instruments go back and forth, like a conversation. The singer starts smooth, then gets kinda rougher at the end.\n* **Part 2:**  A trumpet player comes in with a muted trumpet – think of it like a cool echo of the tune.  He plays some really long notes, adding this bluesy flavor.\n* **Part 3:**  The clarinet player takes over, playing high and fast. The piano adds these little, off-beat notes that make it all swing.\n* **Part 4:**  The whole band jumps in, echoing the first part with the brass and wind instruments trading lines.\n* **Part 5:**  This is the big one! The wind instruments start singing back and forth in their highest range, and the brass and drums play a crazy fast beat, like it’s about to explode!\n* **Part 6:**  Back to the beginning, but the singer is sounding rougher now, almost like they're growling, making their voice sound like an instrument.\n* **The end:** A quick little finish with the singer running up and down the scale, and then, BOOM! A trombone plays a weird note that just hangs in the air.\n\n Ellington was always finding new ways to use his singers, adding this extra color to his music.\n\nIn another song called \"Hot and Bothered,\" he does this cool thing with a trumpet player and a singer. They take turns playing and singing, and their voices and instruments blend together like they were meant to be. And then in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\"  he uses this trombone player named Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton to start the song. It's like he knew exactly how to make each musician sound their best.",
            "This girl, man, she was always chasing after somethin'. It started when she hit her teens, like, at 14.  This need, this emptiness, it just wouldn't quit. By the time she hit 17, she figured out she wanted someone, not some shiny thing. But boys? Pfft.  They tried, those goofy dudes, all awkward smiles and fumbled attempts to win her over. But nothin' worked. She just wasn't feelin' it. It was like a mystery, this whole \"un-woo-able\" thing. She wracked her brain, tried to figure it out, but nothin' stuck. So she just kept on livin', always wonderin' about this hole inside her. \n\nLife at home was usually chill. Her parents were cool, laid-back folks. They never fought, and arguments with their daughter were, like, super rare. The only time things got heated was when she tried to spread her wings and be her own person.  She was the chill kid of super chill parents, but she brought the energy, you know?  Her personality was big time, and people loved her for it. \n\nBut today, things were off. She was wanderin' around the house, lookin' for some spark of inspiration, when BAM! A scream ripped through the air, her mom's voice, all panicked. She bolted into the kitchen, heart pounding, \"Mom! What's wrong?!\" Her mom was sprawled on the floor, lookin' all messed up, whimpering \"Ow\" between breaths. The daughter rushed to her side, \"Mom, tell me what happened!\"\n\nHer mom, voice shaky, managed, \"Sweetheart... I need you to take me to... the hospital.\" She was in bad shape, her daughter could tell.  \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\"  Her mom gestured weakly, and the daughter, thankful she'd taken those self-defense classes, scooped her up and carried her to the car. \n\nThe hospital was a whirlwind of smells: disinfectant, sickness, and fear.  But she was too focused on her mom to feel it. She rushed her inside, screaming for help. Doctors swarmed around, whisked her mom away on a gurney.  Her daughter, left alone, sat in a chair, worry gnawing at her. Turns out, her mom had tried to grab a vase from a high shelf and tumbled off a step stool.",
            "Alright, so picture this: there's this super healthy way of eating called the \"Mediterranean Diet,\" or Med diet for short.  It's all about lots of fruits, veggies, nuts, whole grains, and fish, with less meat and fat.  Think of it like a giant salad bar with a side of delicious fish!\n\nWell, some brainiacs wanted to see if this Med diet could actually keep your ticker in tip-top shape and prevent heart problems.  They called it the \"aMed diet\" and even made a special score to see how well people followed it. Turns out, folks who ate like they were on a Mediterranean vacation had WAY less heart attacks and strokes.\n\nThis wasn't just some random guess, though. A bunch of smart nurses filled out questionnaires about what they ate for like, twenty years straight.  They even checked their medical records to make sure everything was on the up and up. And guess what? The nurses who ate the most Med-style grub were way less likely to have a heart attack or stroke.\n\nSo, basically, if you wanna live a long, healthy life, maybe start loading up on that Mediterranean goodness!",
            "Back in 2007, America went through a rough patch, like, super rough. People lost their jobs left and right, houses were worth nothin', and even big companies went belly up. This whole mess, it's still kinda hangin' around today. So, what went wrong? Well, let's just say some folks in charge made some bad calls, ya know? They pushed banks and companies to give out loans to folks who weren't exactly the best at paying 'em back. Meanwhile, these two big fellas, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, kept buyin' up these bad loans and stuffin' 'em into these fancy packages. Like, they thought they could sell 'em off like hotcakes. But when people couldn't pay, BAM! The whole thing came crashin' down.\n\nSee, this whole thing started way back in '99 when President Clinton was tryin' to get re-elected. He wanted to look good, ya know? So, he loosened up the rules about loans, which kinda set the stage for this whole mess seven years down the line. One guy, Steven Holmes from the New York Times, he was like, \"Whoa, this ain't gonna end well.\" He saw what was comin', but nobody listened.\n\nSo, now we had these newfangled mortgages, like the ones with interest rates that changed all the time. Plus, these crazy things called mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations. It's like they were tryin' to make everything more complicated than it needed to be. Everyone got so mixed up in the housing market, they forgot to watch their own wallets.\n\nThen, boom! The bubble burst. All those banks and companies that had bought up those fancy mortgage packages were in big trouble. They were drownin' in debt, and the big players, like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, went down in flames.  Fannie and Freddie, those two mortgage giants, they were in trouble too. They were so deep in debt, the government had to step in and take over. \n\nIt was a real mess, man.",
            "Alright, let's talk about exposition. That part of your story where you're supposed to dazzle readers with your fancy writing, you know, the part where everyone's hanging on your every word or... they're hitting that \"Back\" button and muttering curses under their breath. Dr. Merlin, a writing guru I know, she gets pretty riled up when she encounters too much exposition. It's like watching paint dry, only less exciting.\n\nYou writers out there, you already know the golden rule: \"Show, don't tell.\" But even the best of us sometimes fall into the trap of info-dumps, paragraphs and paragraphs of nothing happening, or worse, way too much happening all at once. Exposition is like that little voice in your ear whispering, \"Get the backstory out of the way so you can get to the juicy parts!\"  It's that same voice that makes you want to tell the reader every single detail about every character's childhood.\n\nExposition is basically just telling your audience what happened, usually in a plain and boring way. Think of those long, winded explanations in movies where one character lays out a whole history lesson to another. In writing, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nHere's an example. Imagine you're reading a story where the heroine meets her true love, they have a fancy wedding, and then, bam! He's murdered right in front of her. Would you want to read two whole pages about this, with only a couple of lines of dialogue from each character? Probably not. You'd want the author to spend some time developing the husband's character. Make him come alive through his words, his actions, showing how deeply he loves his wife. You'd want to see how her life changed and improved because of him, in big and small ways.\n\nA good introduction to the husband would make you care about what happens to him, and it would give you a better understanding of the heroine. You'd mourn his death with her, and that would make you feel more connected to her.\n\nBasically, you want to give your readers something more than just the bare bones of the story. You want to give them the juicy stuff, the details that make the story come alive.\n\nSometimes it's tempting to rush past important details. You might have a new character who used to be in the Air Force, now he's a gas station night manager, he's been married twice, no kids, loves fishing, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast. Give us the details!",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about these news stories I saw from Columbus, Ohio. See, I was watchin' NBC 4 this mornin', August 13th, and this dude named Shad Hostettler, looked like a real scumbag, ya know? Stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. They didn't even say her name, but they showed his mugshot, and boy, did he look evil! They only talked about it for a couple minutes 'cause it was still happening, but they said he stabbed her a bunch of times and got arrested.\n\nThen they talked about some kid named Travis Buyers, 18, got shot up in Sharon Woods early that mornin'. Critically injured, they said, but no arrests yet. SWAT team's on the case. Seemed like they rushed through that one, though. Maybe 'cause he was a black kid, ya know? I've noticed that before, always seems like the media goes crazy over white folks, but black folks, well, it's like they don't even exist sometimes.\n\nNext up, some genius shot a hole in a Med-Flight chopper with a .22 rifle. They were talkin' about where it happened and stuff. Crime Stoppers offered five grand for any tips leading to the shooter. \n\nThen they threw in some weather stuff - rain and thunderstorms comin' Saturday. Short and sweet, like they wanted ya to keep watchin'.\n\nFollowed that with a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. Some dude, supposedly black, wearing a hoodie, about six feet tall and 150 pounds, robbed the place. They kept sayin' he was black and how dark his skin was, seemed kinda weird to me.\n\nFinally, they talked about this Rene Rodriguez, some big-shot drug dealer from Texas. Convicted of sendin' weed to Ohio. Instead of sayin' 25 years, they said \"300 months\". Like that made it sound worse or somethin'. And they kept sayin' he was Hispanic, not sure why that mattered.",
            "Brothers, man, they're somethin' else.  Like, there's this crazy bond between 'em, ya know? It's like, unbreakable, like a freakin' steel cable.  But it's more than just good stuff, like love and all that.  There's jealousy, anger, even that messed-up stuff like cruelty, thrown in there too.  \n\nBrothers, they get each other like nobody else.  It's like lookin' in a mirror, seein' yourself straight up.  But when things get really rough, that's when this bond, it really shows its true colors.  And let me tell ya, sometimes those colors can be pretty darn ugly. \n\nSee, understandin' what brothers feel, it ain't easy.  It's like a rollercoaster of emotions, and the consequences, well, they can be a real pain in the neck.\n\nYou see it all the time, these brothers, starin' each other dead in the eyes, seein' their own reflection.  Not how others see 'em, but the real deal, the good, the bad, the whole shebang.  And in their actions, in the stuff they do and the stuff that happens because of it, that's where you see their true colors, their real character. \n\nThis story, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" it's all about that.  These two brothers, they're like two sides of the same coin, full of all these crazy emotions, tossin' 'em around like it's nothin'.  They go on this wild ride, this journey, and it's a real tearjerker. \n\nOne brother, he's got this big ol' pride thing goin' on.  He wants a brother who can keep up, who can do all the cool stuff, you know? But his little brother, Doodle, he's different. He can't keep up, he's always slowin' him down. And the older brother, well, he starts gettin' all resentful, even angry.",
            "Man, my brain is like this crazy computer, but way cooler! Back in the day, people thought it was like a wax thing or a scroll, but now we know better. It's more like a super-powered machine that takes in all kinds of stuff from the world around us, like sounds, smells, and stuff you can touch. \n\nIt's all about how your brain takes these signals and makes sense of them. It's like a team effort, with different parts working together. First, it breaks things down into tiny bits, like figuring out what colors are where and what shapes are what. Then, it uses what it already knows to help figure things out faster. Like, if you see a black box on a white background, your brain already knows what a box looks like, so it can zoom right in and say, \"Hey, that's a box!\"\n\nBut hold on, there's more! Your brain's also got this super-focus thing called attention. It's like a spotlight that shines on the most important stuff. So, you might be looking at your shoes, but your brain's mostly ignoring all the tiny blades of grass. But if someone says your name, BAM! Your brain's all over it.\n\nAnd get this, your brain stores all this information! It's got different memory places, like a short-term memory for things you're thinking about right now and a long-term memory for everything else. It's how you remember your best friend's birthday or how to ride a bike.\n\nScientists are still trying to figure out exactly how all this works, but they have some pretty cool ideas. One idea is that your brain is like a giant network of connections, with each connection representing a thought or idea.",
            "Okay, so picture this: there's this book called \"Brave New World\" by this dude Huxley, right? He's basically saying that all this fancy technology and the whole \"gotta keep buying stuff\" thing is gonna mess us up big time. See, in this world, folks are all about being part of the group and getting their instant happiness fix. They're practically brainwashed from the get-go to chase after pleasure and forget about being themselves. It's like they're all playing a game, but they don't even know they're pawns!  \n\nThis Huxley dude, he's got this angle that kinda sounds like Marxism. You know, the whole idea that things ain't always fair and that the rich folks are using us for their own gain?  Huxley throws around words like \"homogeny\" and \"reification,\" which basically mean everyone's the same and stuff gets turned into just a thing to be bought and sold. It's like he's saying the whole system is rigged against the little guy.\n\nHe's also got this sharp point about how people in \"Brave New World\" are tricked into thinking they're happy even though they're not. They're so focused on getting the latest gadget or having the coolest clothes that they don't even see the bigger picture. It's like they're wearing a pair of rose-colored glasses, but those glasses are blinding them to the truth.\n\nAnd get this, the way those upper-class folks just go along with everything, even though they know it's messed up, that's kinda like what Marx talked about too! He called it \"hegemony,\" basically one group of people controlling everything while the rest just go along with it.\n\nThen there's this whole thing about relationships. Or, rather, the lack of them.  Everyone's so busy chasing after their own pleasure that they don't have time for real connections. It's all surface level, like they're just going through the motions.\n\nHuxley might be saying that technology and capitalism are sucking the soul out of humanity. No time for love, no time for deep thoughts, just endless consumerism and shallow interactions. It's kinda scary, you know?",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this college campus, man. I've been here for a couple years now, and let me tell ya, getting around this place is a real pain in the butt.  My freshman year, I lived way out east, practically on the edge of the world.  Getting to classes in some random building like Willard, which is, like, in the middle of everything, took forever. \n\nAbout 25 minutes, walking, especially if the weather was being a total jerk, which, let's be real, happens all the time here in State College. I heard from one of my buddies who just graduated that back in the day, there was, like, tons of empty space between the East Halls dorms and the rest of campus. Now, they've built a bunch of new stuff: sports fields, fancy buildings like the Creamery and a new health center, even apartments. \n\nAs the campus keeps growing, it's getting harder and harder to get from point A to point B. What's the best way to solve this mess? Bikes, baby! But it's not just about having bikes, the whole campus needs to be built for bikers. I was talking to this dude the other day who got back into biking after a long break, and he said, \"Bikes are awesome! It's the only way to get around.\"\n\nBesides being good for you, biking is the fastest and most efficient way to travel. You can easily cruise 30 miles on a bowl of oatmeal and some pedaling.  I live off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms.  The best decision I made this year was buying a bike. My classes are in Thomas building, which is, like, a 25-minute walk from my place. But on my bike? Bam! 5 minutes flat if I really push it! \n\nThe only problem is, Pollock Road is the fastest way to get there, but it ain't always the safest for biking.  Walking is cool too, but I'm too busy for that. If I didn't have my bike, I'd be stuck walking everywhere.  Walking to Thomas every day would be an extra 30-40 minutes each way, that's over two and a half hours a week!  And that's just for one class! Add on all the other stuff, and that's way too much time wasted."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day!

            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "So, I'm thinkin' about becoming a social worker, ya know? Figured I'd go with the Division of Family and Children Services and help out those kids who've had a rough go of it, the ones who've been abused or forgotten.  I wanna lend a hand to families too, 'cause sometimes they just need a little extra support.  \n\nSee, for me, social work ain't just a job, it's a way of life. I've always wanted to help people, but I didn't know how 'til I figured out what I was good at.  I went to college and got my degree in Psychology, but I still felt like something was missing.\n\nThen one summer, I met this kid, just sixteen, sitting on my friend's couch lookin' like he'd seen a ghost. Turns out, he was runnin' from his parents, who weren't exactly the nicest folks. I didn't know what to do, but I knew I had to help. I talked to the cops, told 'em I was a psychology grad.  They asked me to talk to the parents 'cause they couldn't do much for the kid.  Man, those parents were somethin' else! They were all nervous and makin' excuses about their son bein' a manipulator. It was a wake-up call for me. That's when I knew I wanted to be a social worker, someone who could actually make a difference for kids like him.\n\nAnd let's talk about social justice, somethin' that's super important in this field.  Society always talks about how much it cares about individuals, but then it tries to cram everyone into the same mold.  Why can't we celebrate our differences instead of tryin' to be just like everyone else?  I've always been my own person, standin' up for what I believe in.  I protested against injustice whenever I could, dyed my hair crazy colors, wore clothes that showed who I was, even joined the GSBA.  I'm all about fightin' for what's right, and social work is the perfect way to do that.",
            "This piece is gonna break down the sleep-trouble thingy called insomnia, lookin' at why it happens. We'll check out two main ideas: what's going on inside ya (the biological stuff) and what's happening around ya (the sociocultural stuff).\n\nFirst off, let's talk about sleep problems in general. You got your main sleep trouble types: the ones that stand alone (like insomnia), the ones that come with other mental stuff (like anxiety or depression), and the ones caused by stuff like medical stuff or drugs.\n\nNow, insomnia is a real pain. It's when you can't fall asleep or stay asleep, and it's been bugging ya for at least a month. Then there are other sleep issues like oversleeping (hypersomnia) or narcolepsy, which is when ya suddenly fall asleep, even when you don't want to.\n\nSo, the \"what's inside ya\" idea says that genes and your body's insides play a big role. There's this part of your brain called the hypothalamus, which has special cells called orexins that tell you when to sleep and when to wake.\n\nOne study found that these orexin cells have something called GABAB receptors, which are like tiny switches that control sleep. When these switches are turned on, it makes you sleepy. But if they're messed up, well, that could be why you can't sleep!\n\nNow, the \"what's around ya\" idea says that your life stuff matters too. Your job, your family, your money – all that stuff can affect your sleep. Imagine if you're stressed out because you're worried about money or work – it's gonna be hard to sleep!",
            "Alright, listen up! Let's talk about this thing called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short. It's basically when your brain has trouble makin' sense of sounds, even if your ears are workin' just fine. Think of it like this: your ears are like a radio receiver, pickin' up all the signals, but the brain is the speaker, and sometimes the speaker is messed up. \n\nSo, how do you know if someone's got CAPD? Well, there are some red flags, like havin' trouble followin' conversations in a noisy place, mixin' up words, or missin' things when someone's talkin'. It's not that they're not listenin', it's just their brain's havin' a hard time sortin' out all the noise.\n\nNow, imagine you're a teacher in a regular classroom. What can ya do to help a kid with CAPD? Well, ya gotta be patient and creative.  Maybe try lettin' them sit closer to the front,  use visual aids, and break down instructions into smaller steps.  Remember, everyone learns differently, and with a little extra help, kids with CAPD can still succeed!",

This play, Twelfth Night, it's like, totally saying that while disguises are great for pulling off con games for a long time, eventually, you gotta ditch the fake persona or you're gonna lose yourself completely.  The thing is, stopping the charade can be a real pain in the neck 'cause you might end up alienating all your friends. So, it's a tough call:  stay true to yourself or keep the peace? Some people are cool with being tricked, but others? Not so much. They'll be totally offended. \n\nNow, pretending to be the opposite gender is a whole other can of worms. Why do people even bother with that?  Why ditch your real identity and pretend to be someone you're not?  Well, in Viola's case, it's all about survival. She's in a strange land, and she needs to protect herself from creepy dudes.  So, she becomes Cesario, a dude. It works, but it also cuts her off from other women, which is kinda a bummer.  \n\nGet this – she's so good at playing a guy that Olivia, this rich lady, totally falls for her!   \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" She's even got Orsino, who's like, totally into her, but she's pretending to be a dude! It's a mess! \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"  \n\nSo, maybe this play is saying that pretending can help people figure out their true feelings?

            "Alright, so listen up!  This whole German colonial thing, yeah?  It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, especially for the Ovaherero and Nama people in South West Africa.  Talk about a massacre!  But hey, you can't just paint a whole empire with one brush, right?  Germany had a bunch of different colonies, each with its own style. \n\nSame goes for schools.  When the Brits took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they were surprised to find a bunch of educated folks already there.  Seems those Germans did a decent job in some places.  But then you got South West Africa, which was a whole different story.  \n\nUnlike East Africa where the government built schools and stuff, in South West Africa, they left it all to the missionaries.  Those missionaries got some government support, but not much.  Meanwhile, the Germans were all about educating their own people, building fancy schools and supporting those missionary ones too.  This messed things up big time for South West Africa. While other colonies had tons of educated Africans, South West Africa was like, \"Nah, we good.\" Most folks there were still stuck in the dark ages, can't read, can't write, you know the drill.\n\nWhy the big difference?  Well, that's what this paper's all about.  We gotta dig into the whole settler scene and figure out what the bigwigs were thinking.  There's a ton of books about German schools, mostly written back in the day, but we need to take a closer look at what went on in South West Africa.  Some smart folks like Cohen have already compared South West Africa to East Africa and found some clues.  They think the big white population in South West Africa had a lot to do with it.\n\nSouth West Africa wasn't as hot and sweaty as some other colonies, but they still had a ton of desert.  And guess what?  More white folks wanted to live there! By 1913, almost 15,000 whites were calling South West Africa home, way more than any other colony.",
            "Man, music these days is wild! Like, there's so many different kinds of music now, it's crazy. Rock, pop, rap, country, jazz, folk—you name it, there's a genre for it. And get this, each of those genres has like, a million sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. It's like a never-ending musical family tree!\n\nBut let's talk about heavy metal, because that's where things get really interesting. That stuff's been around for ages, but it's exploded in the last 40 years. Heavy metal is all about feeling things, you know? And not the happy-go-lucky kind of feelings either. We're talking dark, intense emotions, the kind that make you wanna headbang until your head falls off. \n\nIt's also super diverse. People realized early on that heavy metal wasn't just one thing, it was a whole playground for creativity. So they started making their own sub-genres, then sub-sub-genres, and so on. \n\nNow it's like, what even IS heavy metal anymore? It's borrowed stuff from every other genre, but it still has that core, that dark, powerful energy.  \n\nTo understand heavy metal today, you gotta understand where it came from. It's more than just music, it's a movement. A movement fueled by darkness, loudness, and a whole lotta attitude.\n\nThink about it: more bass, more volume, more guitars screaming, more theatricality. It's like the music scene said \"screw subtlety\" and cranked everything up to 11.\n\nAnd yeah, let's not forget the drugs. The 70s were wild, man. All those psychedelics made people think differently, do different things, make different music. And heavy metal was born from that chaos.\n\nThey weren't afraid to explore the dark side of life, something that was kinda taboo in mainstream music back then. They drew inspiration from the Romantics, those poets who were all about intense feelings and dark themes.  \n\nEven the Beatles got in on the action. Their song \"Helter Skelter\" is a prime example. It's raw, it's chaotic, it's a glimpse into the darkness that was brewing.",

This dude wasn't just painting dreams, he was *living* them, ya know? His famous painting, \"The Dream,\" from 1910, shows this lady totally blown away by the cool stuff she sees in her dream. But here's the kicker - it's also about Rousseau's own dreams, like, what he wanted out of life as an artist.  \n\nSee, he always wanted people to get his art, to be all \"WOW, this guy's amazing!\" But there was this big problem: he had this crazy fight going on inside his head. Should he paint like everyone else to get famous, or should he just do his own thing and be different? \"The Dream\" is like his big, messy answer to that question.\n\nNow, to understand what's going on, you gotta know a little about this guy. He was born way back in 1844 in a dusty French town. His dad was some kind of rich merchant, but Rousseau didn't get any fancy art training. He spent years working for the government, collecting taxes and stuff, until he was like, forty! Then, tragedy struck - his wife and almost all his kids died.  He decided to paint to escape his sadness and start fresh. Unlike those other artists who painted fancy pictures of peasants, Rousseau was a regular guy with regular dreams.\n\nRousseau really, really wanted to be a big deal in the art world.  He was starting late, and all these other artists were already famous. He was like, \"Hey, I'm good too!\" but nobody was listening.  This other artist, Matisse, was getting all the attention, and Rousseau was stuck in the shadows. This guy Gordon wrote a book about French art, and he said that Matisse was all about being different and unique, while Rousseau just wanted to paint something so normal that people would finally accept him.",

You ever try to tell someone why you love a certain song? You might say somethin' about the beat, or the lyrics, but it ain't the whole story, ya know? There's just this... *something*\n\nSame with good stuff like kindness or honesty. We can talk about why it's important, but it's more than just words. It's like, deep down, you just *know* it's good.\n\nThat's why I think art and good stuff are connected.  They're both kinda magical, ya know? They move us in ways we can't always explain. It's like this feeling you get when you read a super good book, or see a painting that just blows you away. It's more than just pretty colors or a good story. It's somethin' deeper.",
            "So, lemme tell ya about Germany, alright? It's a powerhouse, a real unified crew, with its own crazy cool culture, from the Alps in München all the way to the Baltic Sea in Kiel.  You feel the same vibe from Köln on the Rhine to Dresden in Saxony by the Elbe.  It's a mix of all sorts of stuff, ya know?  \n\nSee, Germany's got a wild history, a whole bunch of different tribes and stuff that came together to make it what it is today.  Folks call this ancient land \"Germania,\" but where that name came from, well, that's a mystery even smarter folks than me can't solve. Tacitus, this old dude who wrote about Germans way back when, thought it came from a tribe called the Tungrians. They were called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and went head-to-head with the Gauls, ya see. (Tacitus, 98, get it?  Like, 98 AD!)  Then there's Julius Caesar, who, back in the day, used the word \"Germanus\" to talk about these pesky tribes he was fighting near the Rhine.  He nicked it from the Gauls, probably, a way to tell who he'd conquered and who he hadn't. Some think it was just a neighborly term in Gaulish, you know, like \"Hey, those Germans over there.\" (Names of Germany) Other folks say it came from the spear they used, called a \"ger,\" or maybe it meant \"shouty\" in some old language, 'cause Germans were known for being loud. (O.E.D, 2010, whatever that means).\n\nThis other Roman dude, Tacitus, wrote a book called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" way back in 98 AD. It's about where Germans came from, and he's like, \"These guys?  They're the real deal, no mixing with other folks, they just *were*.  Nobody would leave Asia or Africa for this wild, cold, grumpy place unless it was home, right?\" (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who'd want to leave Rome for Germania?  Not the Romans, not at first anyway.  But they'd send their guys out to get stuff and fight the occasional battle, but mostly, they went back to their big ol' empire.\n\nSo, these Germanic tribes, they were hanging out on the edge of Rome's land, trading their stuff and even fighting for Rome in their army.  (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17)",
            "Man, I was staring at this thing, my brain just kinda... empty. Not thinking, just seeing. Like, super focused but not really 'getting' it, y'know? Thoughts were popping in and out, but nothin' stuck. It was like my mind was just... flowing with what I was looking at.\n\nThis artist pal once told me to check out this book, \"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" or somethin'.  Always wanted to draw, ever since I was a kid, and this book was supposed to teach ya how, like, what a pencil is and how your brain even sees lines. \n\nOne trick in there is to picture a box around whatever ya lookin' at.  Like, say you've got a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen that's connected to a dining room, bam! Now it's just the bowl of fruit, simple as that.\n\nBut staring at this thing... I couldn't do it. It was just too much, too mind-blowing. Picasso had his blue stuff, Monet went crazy for green, Renaissance dudes loved all the colors.  My art was gonna be different, man, this was gonna be \"Work in Brown,\" the start of my masterpiece.\n\nSo I grabbed my tool, muscles gettin' tense and loose as I moved my hand, like, my mind was telling my hand what to do.  Water was swirlin', smooth and clear, and stuff was breakin' off and just... gone.  Muscles gettin' jumpy, I slammed the toilet handle again.  This brown thing wasn't budging, stuck like a bug on the bottom.\n\nMop in hand, feet apart, tie chokin' me, I frowned at this mess someone left for us bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of peaceful thinkin', then I grabbed the toilet paper, wrapped it around my hand like a giant oven mitt, and dove in. Just like a mom checkin' on the turkey in the oven...",
            "Yo, check this out.  Junior drivers are croakin' behind the wheel, man. It's a real bummer. Why? Well, the brainiacs at the National Institutes of Health say those teen brains ain't quite ready for the insanity of the road yet.  And, let's face it, they're green as grass. Not only do they cause more wrecks, but they're more likely to flip their cars, speed like crazy, and end up in the ditch.  \n\nTalk about a recipe for disaster!\n\nAnd get this, having your buddies in the car makes it even worse.  Some smarty-pants in California did a study and found that the more passengers a teen has, the more likely they are to crash.  Duh!\n\nSo, some states are tryin' to fix this mess by giving teens these temporary licenses that limit their driving time and how many friends can tag along.  But, honestly, that's just a band-aid on a gaping wound. The real problem is that teen drivers, statistically speaking, are just not cut out for the dangers of the road.  This psychologist dude, Marvin Zuckerman, thinks 18 is even too young to get a license.  He says teenagers are wired to take risks just for the rush, which, let's be real, is a bad combo with a steering wheel.  \n\nWe gotta delay driving until they're a little older, when they've calmed down and don't feel the need to live life on the edge.  Otherwise, we're gonna have a highway full of carnage.  Just you wait—the Baby Boomers' kids are gonna be hitting the road soon, and that's a whole lot of new drivers with questionable skills.\n\nHere's what we need: a national law that says no one under 18 can drive. Schools can still teach 'em about driving, but no keys until they're older.  We can still have those temporary permits and practice hours, but no exceptions.  That way, we can keep everyone safe.\n\nIt ain't rocket science, folks.",
            "So, I was digging through these old Edison movies at the Library of Congress, you know, the ones from way back when. I found fifteen of these \"trick films\" from between 1895 and 1901. These flicks, they're all about tricking your eyes with clever editing. Basically, I wanted to figure out how they made these tricks work and see if any of them got fancy later on. \n\nMost of the time, these early trick films were pretty simple. They were like little plays, all set up in front of a camera like a stage. No fancy camera moves, just straight-ahead shots of people doing their thing.  Think of it like a vaudeville show, but on film! You know, the audience always sees the whole picture at once, just like on a stage. \n\nThese tricksters mostly stuck to long shots or medium shots, never getting close-up on anyone's face.  They even kept the action limited to side-to-side movements  - no walking towards or away from the camera. Like in this film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" from 1900, the actors just walk back and forth, never leaving that stage-like area. \n\nAnd get this, each trick film was usually just one long shot, like a single scene.  They couldn't really tell a full story because they were so short. They were more like little magic tricks or gags, lasting maybe a minute or less. \n\nBut here's the kicker: what looks like one shot to us might actually be several shots spliced together to make the illusion work. Take \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" from 1895, for example.  If you watch closely, you'll see the moment where they switch out the \"head\" – it's like a hidden camera trick!",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya 'bout this dude John Taylor, real upstanding guy, straight outta Caroline. This fella was all about the Republican thing, ya know?  Didn't matter that he was a farmer, that life and his little stint in politics made him a real firebrand when it came to folks' freedom and how the government should run things. He was all about farms and stuff, thought it was the best job in the world, and that's what shaped his whole take on the government, the Constitution, even the courts.\n\nSee, John thought America had a shot at gettin' things right 'cause we didn't have no old traditions messin' things up. We could build somethin' new, somethin' based on people takin' care of themselves. He was a real believer in rights, the kind you're born with, that can't be touched by the government.  He figured if you mess with one right, they all start to crumble.  And he thought the idea of a \"state of nature\" where the strong just bulldoze the weak was a load of baloney. Civilization should be better than that.\n\nTo make this perfect society, John thought we needed a government that knew folks are a mix of good and bad. He was hard-line on that, thought we gotta be honest about it. He said,\"Government's run by people, so it's gonna have all the good and bad that comes with 'em.\"  He thought good government protected your stuff, helped farmers, and kept big businesses in check. He figured even if the people runnin' things were greedy, a good system would still work out fair.\n\nJohn believed folks are driven by self-interest, but it ain't always bad. It's only bad when it makes folks want to screw over others.  A good government keeps that in check.  He was all about the Constitution, but he didn't think just readin' the words was enough. You gotta understand what the guys who wrote it meant.  He thought the Declaration of Independence was even more important 'cause it made it clear America was a bunch of separate states, not just one big country.",
            "So, check it out. We were tracking how many folks were ditching their cars for bikes or walking or whatever, right? But in month three, bam!  The numbers nosedived like a cheetah on roller skates. Kinda bummer, ya know?\n\nWinter hit New England, so maybe folks just stopped biking and walking as much.  Plus, December is crazy busy with school stuff ending and holidays kicking in.  People are probably too swamped with exams and gift-wrapping to remember to fill out those log sheets. \n\nThen, December turned into January, and everyone was on break. Like, no one even needs to be on campus! Then classes start up again in January, and, guess what? Still low numbers! \n\nYou know how it is, things get hyped up at first, then people kinda lose steam.  We tried to pump things up with a \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, and it worked! More people started logging their commutes.  \n\nBut here's the deal - keeping people interested when there's a natural lull, plus those big school breaks, is tough.  \n\nAnother thing? People love their cars. It's like, built into our brains! So, to get them to ditch the wheels, you gotta give 'em good reasons. \n\nWe gave away cool stuff like gift cards to local places – restaurants, coffee shops, even massages!  I wonder if something bigger, like a sweet bicycle or even a hybrid car, would have made a bigger splash.\n\nWe kept the prizes the same the whole time. Maybe if we'd upped the ante as things went on – maybe a couple bikes in December, then a hybrid or electric car in January – things might have stayed super pumped.",
            "Hold onto your hats, folks! Today we're diving deep into the wild world of ETFs, those fancy financial instruments that track stuff like stock indexes or even whole baskets of assets. Think of them like index funds, but way more flexible, like a stock you can buy and sell on the open market.  \n\nThese bad boys give you the best of both worlds: the spread-out protection of an index fund and the cool perks of owning individual stocks, like short selling, margin trading, and snagging just one share at a time. Oh, and did I mention they're usually cheaper to own than your average mutual fund? Talk about a win-win!\n\nBut hold up! There's always a catch, right? Well, with ETFs, you gotta cough up a commission every time you buy or sell, just like with regular stocks.  And while they offer a ton of choices, it's always smart to double-check if those benefits, like diversification, are really delivering the goods.\n\nToday, we're putting a popular ETF called IHF under the microscope. We're gonna compare it to its top ten holdings, which make up a whopping 63.58% of the whole shebang. These top dogs are like the VIPs of the ETF world, so if we understand them, we're halfway to understanding the whole crew.\n\nWe're gonna see if owning just these ten stocks would be just as good, or even better, than owning the whole IHF ETF.  Plus, we'll see if we can find a better way to mix and match these ten stocks to get even better returns, like a financial magic trick!  \n\nFirst, we'll crunch some numbers to figure out how these ten stocks contribute to the overall return and risk (or Beta) of the ETF. Then, we'll see if these two portfolios - the ETF and the top ten - are truly different, or just playing a game of chance. Stay tuned, folks, it's gonna be a wild ride!",
            "Alright, so check it out, this poem \"Dream-Land\" by Poe, he thinks it's pretty rad. Now, Poe uses this word \"Thulé\" a couple times, and some dude named Mabbott figured out it comes from this old dude Virgil. Virgil used it for this island way up north, like beyond the edge of the known world, ya know?  Virgil totally used it, but there's this other dude, Goethe, who Poe was digging big time. This Karl J. Arndt guy, he wrote a whole book about Poe and Goethe's poems, and he reckons Poe was basically copying Goethe.\n\nGoethe, man, he was a big deal. Wrote this epic poem called \"Faust,\" two parts, way back in the day.  Part two has this poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It's about this king whose wife kicks the bucket after giving him this goblet. He starts drowning his sorrows in booze, missing his queen like crazy.  Then he's all, \"Screw this,\" decides to join his wife, gives his stuff to his kids, except for the goblet, walks to a cliff, tosses the goblet in the ocean, closes his eyes, and bam! Dead. Pretty messed up, right?  \n\nSo, the King of Thulé and the dude in Poe's poem, they're kinda like mirror images, like Poe's own messed up feelings bottled up in this poem.  There was even this play version of Faust in 1842,  just before Poe used \"Thulé\" in his other poem, \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" \n\nPoe uses \"Thulé\" twice in his poems, like bookends, but \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land,\" they're like buddies. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about how dark and lonely Thulé is, haunted by dead friends, everything's gray and depressing. Sounds a lot like how the King of Thulé feels after his wife dies, right? \n\nGoethe was a big deal, and Poe would have known him, even if it was just because he liked Tennyson. Plus, Goethe's stuff was everywhere back then.",
            "Okay, lemme tell ya about this crazy case I heard about. So there's this lady, Jennifer, right? She slipped and fell on some spilled applesauce in a grocery store called D&D. Ouch! Turns out, the manager, Paul, knew about the mess 'cause two employees told him about it. But guess what? He was too busy eating dinner!  Thirty minutes passed and BAM! Jennifer goes down!  \n\nNow, Jennifer's lawyer wants to go after Paul big time with \"punitive damages\". That means like, extra money to punish him 'cause they think he was super reckless. See, in California, you can get those if someone acts really bad on purpose, or just plain stupid and doesn't care if someone gets hurt. And in this case, they think Paul fits the bill.  \n\nThey're going to argue that Paul knew this store was a slip-and-slide! Apparently, there'd been five other falls that year already! But nope, he still wouldn't clean it up.  \n\nIt's a bit of a stretch to say he was \"despicable,\" but hey, it's California, anything goes!  They're gonna try to convince the judge that Paul was playing with fire and Jennifer got burned. \n\nTheir story goes like this:  It was a Friday afternoon, 5 p.m. sharp.  One of Paul's guys, Rich, tells him about the applesauce. Paul's like, \"Dude, I'm on a break, go away!\" Then another employee, Mary, tries to warn him again, and guess what? Same response!  \n\nFinally, at 5:30, poor Jennifer slips and falls, and ouch, she really hurt her back. So now she's suing D&D for all the money they can get.  It's gonna be a showdown in court!",
            "Man, lemme tell ya, four years ago I took this Islam class at CBC, and let me tell ya, things got heated! We were debating whether Islam was a bad religion or not, and it feels even more important today than ever. It's crazy how things have changed since 9/11.  I mean, back then the media was all over Islam, sayin' it was bad news, and now it's like everyone loves it!  Heck, we even got a president named Barack Obama, who's got Muslim roots, can you believe it?!\n\nNow, this book about Muhammad's life, it got me thinkin'. See, I thought Muhammad was a tough guy, conquering tribes and forcing them to become Muslims, but this book paints him as this misunderstood martyr, a humble dude who people just naturally flocked to. It's kinda strange, like they're trying to make him look like some kinda Jesus figure.\n\nAnd get this, there are some crazy similarities between Jesus and Muhammad. Like, there's this story where Muhammad turns some mutton and milk into enough food for forty guys!  It's like they're tryin' to make Muhammad look like some kinda miracle worker, which, you know, kinda steals thunder from Jesus, if you ask me.\n\nThe book's full of stories about people converting to Islam, but a lot of them come from, like, second or third hand accounts. It's all \"so-and-so told me, who heard it from so-and-so.\" It makes you wonder how true it all really is.\n\nThe thing that bugs me the most is how they try to make Muhammad out to be this perfect, gentle guy. But history tells a different story, man! He wasn't exactly Mr. Nice Guy. I gotta wonder if Muslims today even know the real story about how Muhammad got his power.",
            "Whoa, man, listen up!  So, you know how Jesus taught his stuff, right?  Well, after he, like, disappeared, Christianity went totally off the rails!  It's like, they added all this extra junk over time, making it way different from the original deal.  \n\nThese days, everyone's all about change and progress, ya know?  The old-school folks, they cling to what they know, but they're not gonna be able to stop the tide.  People are gonna start figuring out what was really important to Jesus, and ditch all the extra stuff.\n\nIt might take a while, maybe decades, maybe centuries, but it's gonna happen. Christianity's gonna go back to its roots, stripping away all the layers, like turning back time!  Eventually, we'll be worshipping just like they did back in Jesus' day, following only his teachings.\n\nThe churches will still be there, but everything will be way more unified.  No more different groups, no more arguments, just everyone on the same page.  Think of it like history reversing itself.  Remember how Christians used to get persecuted?  Then the Romans became Christian themselves!  Or how slavery ended and African-Americans rose to power?  \n\nThis big shift in Christianity is gonna be just like that.  It'll go back to the source, back to what Jesus really taught, and it'll bring everyone together.  The key is understanding that Jesus' words were meant metaphorically, not literally.  \n\nSo, what happened after Jesus?  Well, before Jesus, there was Judaism, the starting point for it all.  The Jews believed in one God, had scriptures they considered divinely inspired, and they were all about that religious authority.",
            "Man, lemme tell ya about this book, \"The Jungle.\" It's like, a real eye-opener about how messed up people can get when they're all about money and power. I mean, these factory owners, they're like, obsessed with makin' their businesses bigger and richer, no matter who they step on along the way. They're practically demons, those guys.\n\nTake a look at this line from the book: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\".  It's like Upton Sinclair is sayin', \"Yo, look at this pollution! It's outta control!\"  These owners, they don't even care about the air we breathe or the animals gettin' hurt. They're like, \"more profit, more profit!\"  \n\nAnd forget about the workers, man. They're just pawns in this whole game. The owners squeeze 'em dry, makin' 'em work crazy hours, and then BAM! They're out on the street with nothin'. No warning, no nothin'. They don't even get a \"thank you\" for all their hard work.  Back then, there were no rules or nothin' to protect these poor dudes. They were stuck in a system that was rigged against 'em.\n\nIt's like they're slaves, man.  Sinclair even says, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"  Harsh, right?\n\nSo yeah, \"The Jungle\" shows how greedy and selfish humans can be when they're chasin' after money. It's a real wake-up call.",
            "So, you see, some writers are real slick, they use tricks to make you *feel* somethin' about stuff, ya know? Like, they pair words together that wouldn't normally hang out, just to make ya think a certain way. Or they pick symbols, like colors, and give 'em a secret meaning, then use 'em to make ya remember that feeling every time you see 'em. F. Scott Fitzgerald, the guy who wrote *The Great Gatsby*, he's a master of this stuff.\n\nHe does this whole thing with colors, like gold, green, white, gray, and even red and pink. He builds up this meaning, like a secret code, and then uses those colors to remind ya of that feeling later on.\n\nTake white and gray, for example. Fitzgerald uses these colors a lot, and he makes them mean somethin' special. White, it's like, fancy and all that, while gray is kinda old and faded. He throws these colors around everywhere at the start of the story. Daisy and Jordan, they're always dressed in white, like it's the only color they know. Even Nick, he's wearing white flannels at Gatsby's party, and Tom's got a white shirt on when he meets Myrtle. It's like everyone's wearin' white, and the only time they're not is when Nick's getting a vibe from Gatsby's party, and then it's all these crazy colors, like red and blue, nothin' fancy.\n\nThen Fitzgerald keeps throwin' white and gray at ya, like when Nick goes to work, he goes down \"white chasms,\" or when Gatsby's party guests are just \"gray names\" to Nick. Even places are white or gray, like the apartment buildings, the cars, the land, even people like that gray old dog-seller.\n\nSo, after you've seen white and gray everywhere, Fitzgerald uses 'em to show ya somethin' ain't important, or kinda boring. He uses this with Daisy, too. After a while, he describes her in all white, and suddenly, she doesn't seem so special anymore. She's just another white thing, somethin' Gatsby wants but ain't really real. He keeps doin' this with Daisy, makin' her seem like she's just a part of the pattern, not a real person.",
            "So, check this out. San Diego's a real hot spot for growing stuff, thanks to the killer weather. Tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers - they grow it all! And get this, people are going crazy for organic food here. Like, seriously, there are tons of farms selling it straight to folks, and they have waiting lists longer than my arm!  Organic eggs and milk are the faves, too.  \n\nThese organic farms are pretty cool. They give tours, let you hike around, birdwatch, the whole shebang. It's like a win-win: farmers get to be all green and stuff, and people get to learn about where their food comes from. Plus, they get government help for doing it, which is pretty sweet.\n\nNow, here's the thing about organic farming. It's awesome for the environment because it keeps the soil and water clean, which makes all sorts of plants and critters happy. But it's also a bit more work.  It takes extra effort to keep those pesky bugs and weeds away without chemicals, and sometimes you lose more crops. It's like trying to build a castle out of marshmallows - it looks great, but it might not be as strong as a regular brick one.  \n\nThen there are all these other things farmers do to help wildlife, like planting special plants, letting animals graze in different spots, and keeping those nasty invasive plants in check. All that extra work adds up, so it's no wonder farmers sometimes need a little help to make ends meet and keep the wildlife happy.\n\nSo, I found this cool piece of land near a town called Potrero. It's got all sorts of stuff growing on it - chaparral, grass, and oak trees - and it's right next to a big forest.  Lots of animals live there, some even endangered ones like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog.\n\nThis land has a cool history. Native Americans lived there for ages, then ranchers came along and raised cattle and chopped down trees for firewood.  It's been around for a long time, and now someone could make it into an awesome organic farm.\n\nI found a real farm doing this kind of stuff nearby and checked out what kind of help the government offers.  It's pretty inspiring to see people working hard to grow good food and protect nature at the same time.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya somethin' 'bout culture, see?  It's like, way more than just what ya see on the surface. It's like, a whole vibe, y'know? Ain't no two cultures exactly alike, and sayin' somethin' like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are nice\" is just plain wrong.  It's like, yeah, there might be some truths there, but everyone's different, right?  The real deal is to get a feel for what makes a culture tick, how it plays into the deal, and how their way of thinkin' might affect things. \n\nWhen you're dealin' with folks from a different place, you're gonna see it through your own lens, and that's natural. But tryin' to understand 'em means lookin' at their history, their beliefs, their whole deal. You gotta respect it, even if it's different from your own. Especially if you're the one with less to bargain with, ya know?  It's like, if you're walkin' into their turf, show 'em some respect, understand their rules, and things'll go smoother.\n\nNow, culture ain't just 'bout countries.  Even within a country, companies have their own vibes. Some are all about workin' hard, others are chill.  You can tell by how folks dress, how they talk, who they trust to do what.  Some companies encourage helpin' out, others are all about stickin' to the rules. Just look at all the different ways American companies operate, even in the same city.  And some cultures, they might seem more uniform at first, but that just means you gotta dig deeper, y'know?\n\nValues, that's the real key. They're like, the reason behind everything. If a culture values lookin' good or keepin' the peace, they ain't gonna embarrass themselves or their boss just to win a deal.  If they value a tough bargain, they ain't gonna give up easy.  So, before you sit down at the table, get a feel for those values. \n\nBut here's the thing:  gettin' to know the other guy personally can make a big difference too.  It's like, understand their values, but also, who they are.  That's how you make a real connection and get a good deal.",
            "Alright, lemme break this down for ya. So, these two brainiacs, St. Anselm and St. Thomas, both think God's the real deal. They're like, \"Yo, God exists!\" But they go about proving it in totally different ways. Anselm's all, \"Look inside yourself, dude! God's already there, man! You just gotta know it!\" He's sayin' that faith, like, knowing somethin' without proof, is the key. Kinda like trustin' your gut, ya know? \n\nThen there's Thomas, who's like, \"Nah, man, we need evidence! We gotta use our smarts!\"  He lays out five reasons why God's gotta be real, like pieces of a puzzle, ya dig?  He's all about logic and facts.\n\nNow, both these guys make some good points, but neither one, like, totally knocks it outta the park. \n\nIt's kinda like this: Anselm's sayin' faith is enough, but can you really trust somethin' you can't see or touch? And Thomas is like, \"Show me the proof!\" but where do you even start lookin' for proof of somethin' bigger than everything? It's a head-scratcher, man.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this dude, Buddha. He was born way back, like, way back in the day, like the 5th or 6th century BCE. This cat was a prince, but he went all zen and ditched the fancy life. He got super enlightened and started preachin', and his teachings became this thing called Buddhism. There's a bunch of different kinds of Buddhism, but the oldest one is called Theravada.  It's been around for like, 2500 years, and things have changed a bit since Buddha was around. Like in Sri Lanka, they got this water-cutting thing they do every year. Monks and regular folks do it, and it's kinda religious, even though Buddha never said nothin' about it.  It's like that, man, all kinds of stuff has changed, from the small stuff to the big stuff, the core stuff. The Theravada Buddhist peeps, both the monks and the regular folks, have had to tweak their beliefs over time. It's like, stuff happens, ya know? \n\nNow, listen up, 'cause we gotta talk about some special words. We're gonna use \"internal\" and \"external\" a lot. An internal force is somethin' that comes from inside the Buddhist crew, doesn't matter if you're a monk or not. An external force is anything from folks outside Buddhism. A hostile force is somethin' that wants to mess with Buddhism, like, hurt it or somethin'. A benign force is just chillin', not tryin' to help or hurt, but it might end up doin' one or the other by accident. We'll be usin' these words a lot, so pay attention.\n\nFirst things first, let's break down the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find safety in the \"triple gem\"—Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha.  Dhamma is like the teachings, all written down in a bunch of books called the Tripitaka. You got the Sutta Pitaka, which is all the Buddha's sayings, the Vinaya Pitaka, which is like the rule book for monks, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which is all the deep, philosophical stuff. They talk about things like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (life is suffering), and Anicca (everything changes).  Gettin' all this stuff down is how you escape Sansara, which is like this endless cycle of bein' born and dying. Along with Sansara, you gotta get rid of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). Only then can you become enlightened.  The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for everyone, but the monks have a lot more. Regular folks gotta follow the five precepts: don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't be a jerk in love, and don't get wasted.  \n\nThe big idea in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, life is suffering (Dukkha). Second,  attaching to stuff causes suffering. Third, you can get rid of suffering. Fourth, there's a path to end suffering, which is called the Eightfold Path.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about these two countries, the U.S. and Mexico. They used to be at each other's throats, like, for a super long time, 57 years, from way back in 1836 to 1893. It was a real showdown, kinda like when Mack sends those goofy robot dudes after us. \n\nBack in 1846, things really kicked off with the Mexican-American War. The U.S. went and stomped all over Mexico, snagged Texas and the Southwest, and basically said, \"This is ours now!\" \n\nBut it wasn't just one big fight, ya know? There were a bunch of smaller skirmishes and arguments along the way. They couldn't see eye-to-eye on stuff like religion, culture, and who owned what. It's kinda like when Camo and Katt argue over who gets to use the TV remote.\n\nThis whole neighbor rivalry thing happens a lot, ya know? Countries that live near each other often butt heads over stuff. It's like when you have a sibling, you're always fighting over something, right? \n\nThe U.S. and Mexico were like that, except on a much bigger scale. This dude Pletcher said that Mexico and Cuba were the only countries that really gave the U.S. a hard time diplomatically, and I guess that makes sense because they're right next door. Other countries in Latin America? Not so much.\n\nReligion was a big deal too. Americans back then weren't too keen on Catholicism, kinda like how Sa2b freaks out when he sees a spider. It all went back to the old days, when the English and Spanish were constantly at odds.  \n\nThose 57 years had a ton of drama, like 17 different disputes!  Most of it was about border stuff, with bandits and outlaws causing trouble on both sides. It wasn't until both countries decided to crack down that things calmed down a bit.\n\n\nEventually, Mexico realized they needed the U.S. for stuff, and the U.S. shifted its focus from taking over land to, well, meddling in Mexico's economy. That's how the rivalry finally died down.",
            "Fifteen years back, bam! I got hit with a nasty illness outta nowhere.  Didn't even know it existed!  See, I was a nurse, always thought that was the safest bet. \"You'll always have a job, people gotta get sick, right?\" That's what everyone kept sayin'. So, even though I dreamed of being a scientist or a journalist, maybe both, I stuck with nursing.  \n\nBut here I was, 46, single, with nothin' saved up and no way to work. Still disabled fifteen years later, livin' on Social Security, and lemme tell ya, I've got nothin' to call my own anymore.  Every day's a struggle, a fight just to feel safe and good about myself.   nothin's for sure anymore, except for one thing: I wouldn't have made it without my family and a few real good friends. Believe me, when disaster hits, you don't feel so tough.\n\nLife throws curveballs, big and small, no matter how prepared you are.  Sometimes you need a hand. I get that we shouldn't rely on the government for everything, but wouldn't it be better if we learned to trust each other again? Help each other out, ask for help when we need it. Instead of building our own little bunkers, maybe we should be building each other up.\n\nThose conservatives talk about \"rugged individualism\" building this country, but it was compassion, respect, and sharing that got our ancestors through tough times. Those pioneers crossing the Rockies didn't do it alone, they relied on each other. \n\n\nSo, yeah, be prepared. I am. I got my emergency kit, first aid stuff, water tablets, and even plastic sheeting for a bio attack. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, canned goods, the whole shebang. If you got the space, grow your own food.  Get a wood stove, if you can.  \n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors. You never know when you might need 'em.",
            "Alright, so how come critters end up looking the way they do?  Is there some kinda rulebook for evolution, ya know?  Back in the day, this guy D'Arcy Thompson, way back in 1917,  said something like, \"Even today, scientists are just starting to figure out how to describe even the simplest creatures with math.\" And guess what? That's still kinda true!  But,  people are gettin' better at using math to figure out how shells grow,  like in those fancy clam things called mollusks.  We're trying to do the same thing with these cool snails called Prunum. We're using  math models and, like,  actual experiments to see how these snails change over time, and why they look the way they do.\n\nThink of a shell like a tube that's always on the move, spiraling around and around. Each twist is called a whorl, and it's all wrapped around this imaginary line called the columella, kinda like the center of the spiral. The size of each whorl can change, and the lines between them are called sutures. Usually, the biggest whorl is the last one, the one that's kind of like the \"belly\" of the snail.  All the other whorls make up the spire,  and the very tip is called the apex.\n\nYou can look at a shell in different ways, like from the top, the bottom, the opening, or even the opposite side of the opening.  \n\nTo count the whorls, you gotta look at it from the top, find the first suture, and draw a line. Then, count all the whorls from that line, even if they're just a little bit there.\n\nBasically, a shell is like a bunch of tiny doors opening up as the snail grows.  We can track these doors across space and time to see how the snail built its shell. We can even use math to figure out how the snail made its shell!  With enough math, we can change things up and see how the snail would look if it grew differently.",
            "Alright, so listen up!  Indonesia's doin' alright, ya know? They're crushin' it with the water and sanitation stuff, gettin' close to those Millennium Development Goals. But when it comes to takin' care of moms and babies, they're fallin' behind.  Like, way behind. It's like, \"Hey, we got clean water, but your kid's, like, dyin' from diarrhea.\"  Makes ya scratch your head, right?\n\nSee, they're sayin' more moms are havin' babies with those fancy \"skilled workers\" around. But here's the kicker: some of these \"skilled workers\" are just midwives, not doctors.  So, yeah, they're makin' progress, but not the kinda progress that saves lives.\n\nAnd they're not doin' so hot with kids either.  Fewer and fewer kiddos are gettin' help when they're sick, and postnatal care?  Forget about it!  It's practically non-existant.\n\nNow, here's the real doozy:  Cesarean sections are way down, like, only 4%. That's low, man, way too low. It's even worse in the country, only 2% compared to 7% in the city.  It's like they're forgettin' about the people who need it most. And the really messed up part? The poor folks, they're strugglin' to even get healthcare.  They're gettin' left behind.\n\nSo, what's the solution?  Should they build more programs or just fix the whole healthcare system? You gotta hand it to the programs, they're quick and easy.  But here's the downside: programs often suck the money and people away from other important stuff.  It's like, \"Hey, we got this HIV program, everyone go there!\"  While other stuff gets ignored.\n\nPlus, when you got a bunch of different programs runnin' around, it gets messy.  You got paperwork everywhere, supplies gettin' lost, and nobody knows what's goin' on.",
            "So, these Victorian books, they're all about fancy stuff and rich people, right?  But then you got these two books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" they're like, \"Nope, forget that!\" They're all about mysteries and weird stuff, which wasn't really a thing back then.  It makes the characters way more interesting, 'cause you get to see what's really going on in their heads.\n\nLike, take Oliver, he's got all these crazy dreams, like he's back with those mean guys, Sikes and Crackit, arguing and stuff. Then BAM!  Gunshots, chaos, lights flashing, he's being dragged away. It's all super confusing and scary, and you can tell Oliver's hurting, both physically and mentally.\n\n\nBoth of these books use dreams and crazy stuff to show us what's really going on inside the characters.  In \"Oliver Twist,\" Oliver's dreams are like windows into his soul, showing us what's bothering him and how he's feeling about everything that's happening. When he gets shot, he has this flashback, like a dream, where he relives the whole thing.  He's trapped, he can't control anything, and all he feels is pain. It's like the world is against him, and he's just a helpless pawn.  It makes you wonder, who's really in charge of his life?  And it makes you feel sorry for him, 'cause he's just a kid trying to survive in a cruel world. \n\n \"Wuthering Heights\" does the dream thing too, but it's a bit more...intense.  It's all about secrets and hidden feelings, and the dreams are like these creepy little glimpses into the characters' dark side.",
            "A couple years back, I was workin' at this after-school program, you know, helpin' out those little elementary kids with their schoolwork. I was pretty good at English and readin', so that's mostly what I stuck to. One day, I got roped into helpin' this little dude named Adrian, I think he was in third or fourth grade, couldn't read worth a lick. Now, this kid, he speaks perfect English,  but somethin' just wasn't right. He'd nail some letters, then completely butcher others, super weird, ya know? I figured he was Latino, but maybe his English was new to him.  We struggled for ages, until one day, Adrian's mom showed up.  Now, she didn't speak a lick of English, just Spanish.  I was tryin' to piece together what she was sayin' with my super rusty Spanish (I was just learnin' back then).  Then it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read fine, he just wasn't familiar with the English alphabet!  I don't know if it made a difference in the long run, but I hope that fella's doin' alright.\n\nSee, that story's why I gotta talk about this whole language barrier thing in schools, especially here in California. It ain't always as obvious as it seems. Even if a kid speaks perfect English, readin' it can still be a major pain.  Everybody knows this problem exists, so what's the deal? For Adrian, it was simple:  tutorin' on English readin', focusin' on the alphabet and sounds. But for kids who barely speak English, it's a whole other ball game. There ain't just one answer, ya know? Dual language programs, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes... none of 'em work miracles on their own. You gotta mix and match!\n\n\nFirst off, dual language programs are a great idea, not just for Spanish speakers, but for everybody! Studies show kids in these programs do better in school.  Some folks get all scared and say it wastes resources and most kids won't benefit.  But that's hogwash! If we made these programs the norm instead of the exception, everyone would be better off. But how do we do it? Make every teacher bilingual?  Nah, that's crazy talk. But we could definitely have bilingual helpers, tutors, you get the idea.",
            "Ok, so picture this: everyone's always talkin' about somethin' big out there, somethin' way bigger than us. Like, duh, right? Some folks go to church, others hit up the temple, some even try to figure it all out on their own. A lot of us just go with what our folks taught us, ya know? But then there are those who say \"Nope, ain't nothin' out there but me!\" They think the world revolves around 'em. Kinda selfish, if you ask me.  Anyway, we all find our own way, tryin' to figure out what makes us tick, what gives our lives meaning. We're lookin' for that spark, somethin' to guide us outta the darkness and into the sunshine.\n\nMy old man, he loved cardinals.  We were sittin' on the porch one day, rain comin' down like crazy, poundin' on the roof. It was like the whole world was drownin'.  He was lookin' out at the rain, all lost in thought. He'd gotten real skinny and his clothes were hangin' off him like he'd shrunk. His hair was thinner too, like the wind had blown it all away. He wouldn't look at me, just stared out at the storm. I felt kinda lost, scared, like I couldn't talk to him about how much I was gonna miss him 'cause sayin' it out loud would make it real. So I just hugged him, moved my chair closer, and we sat there together, watchin' the rain.\n\nHe died that December, five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation didn't really help, just kept him hangin' on longer than the doctors thought.  I couldn't figure out what good that did, y'know? Seemed like a kinda cruel thing for God to do, if He even existed. I didn't pray that night. If God was really listenin', He'd stopped a long time ago.\n\nI didn't wanna see him go, so I didn't. Couldn't stand watchin' the man who made me slip away.  I wanted to remember him how he was, not how he died.  Besides, I knew my dad better than anyone else did, even his own family. I knew he wouldn't want me there, watchin' him fade away. I just curled up in bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called.",
            "Alright, so, get this – the whole \"Gothic Novel\" thing is kinda like a crazy mix-up, right? It's old stuff, but it's also brand new! This guy, Ian Watt, he says it's like an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" which basically means it's a total head-scratcher. People have been talking smack about it, praising it to the heavens, saying it's shallow, then praising its spooky awesomeness.  \n\nSee, this dude Horace Walpole, he wrote the first real Gothic Novel, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" and he mixed up old-school plays with all this nature stuff that was super trendy back then. He called it a \"Gothic Story,\" and BAM! He started a whole new way of writing. \n\nGothic stuff is all about bringing back the spooky vibes of old castles, plays, and legends. When Walpole wrote his thing, people already used \"Gothic\" for all sorts of stuff, like talking about ancient people or whatever. It was like saying something was old-fashioned and not cool compared to the \"modern\" stuff everyone was into.\n\nBut here's the kicker – Gothic novels kinda became a big deal because they had these old-school spooky vibes, but they also let you get into the heads of the characters, which was new and exciting. It's like they're both super old and totally fresh at the same time!\n\nOne of the big ideas in Gothic novels is this whole \"Chivalry\" thing. Think knights in shining armor, brave and honorable, you know? Gothic writers loved talking about chivalry because it was like a reminder of how things used to be, and they thought people weren't as knightly anymore.  \n\nWalpole, he was writing during a time when things were super messed up politically, and he was worried about the future. Maybe he thought the good ol' days were better, back when knights were around. In his story, you see this knightly character named Frederic, who's described as the perfect knight, almost too perfect. He's a prince, he's sad because of some tragedy, and he's supposed to be dead.",
            "Okay, so picture this: you order somethin' online, right?  Like, a new pair of shoes or somethin'.  That order kicks off this crazy chain reaction, like a domino effect, but with stuff instead of dominoes. That's what we call \"Supply Chain Management\", and it's how stuff gets from the raw materials to your doorstep faster than you can say \"Amazon Prime!\"\n\nThis dude named Keith Oliver, back in 1982, came up with the term. He was all about gettin' stuff to customers quick and easy, like a ninja of logistics.\n\nHere's the lowdown: there are six main parts to this whole supply chain thing. We got: \n\n* **Production:** This is where the magic happens!  It's like buildin' a spaceship, but instead of rockets, we're talkin' products. Managers gotta figure out what folks want, how much they want, and where to build it all. Kinda like a super-organized puzzle. \n* **Supply:** Now we gotta get the ingredients for our spaceship, right? That's where supply comes in.  Managers gotta decide who's gonna make what, and if we should team up with other companies. Outsourcing, they call it. It's like gettin' your buddy to help you build your spaceship. \n* **Inventory:** Gotta keep track of all those shiny parts, right?  That's inventory.  Too much, and it takes up space; too little, and we're outta luck. Managers gotta find that sweet spot. \n* **Location:** Where do we build this spaceship, anyway?  Managers gotta pick the best spot for production, thinkin' about stuff like shipping costs and how close it is to customers. \n* **Transportation:** How do we get our spaceship from the factory to the customer? Trucks, trains, planes, maybe even a magic carpet?  Managers gotta figure out the best way to move stuff around. \n* **Information:** This is the brains of the operation.  Managers need to know everything about the whole process, from how much stuff we have to where it's going. Think of it like a giant, interconnected web of data.\n\nIt's a lot to keep track of, but if everything's run smoothly, we get our shiny new spaceship – er, I mean product – delivered right to our door!",
            "Alright, so there's this chick, Ellen, you know, the one from that Juno movie?  She's standing on a street corner, holding up this cardboard sign with some crazy stuff written on it.  It says, \"Hitler is alive in Burma!\"  Now, Burma, that's like this place in Southeast Asia, right?  It's run by these super mean guys who kinda took over back in '62, like a total power grab.  A few years back, these monks, all dressed in saffron robes, started protesting.  They called it the \"Saffron Revolution,\" get it? Anyway, things got really heated, the government wasn't happy, and they started messing with the monks.  Journalists got thrown in jail, one guy even got killed just for taking pictures! It's like, totally messed up.\n\nThis isn't a new thing, though.  It's like, governments have always wanted to control everything, right?  Like back in Rome, the emperors acted like they were gods, bossing everyone around.  And don't even get me started on Japan, they think their emperors are, like, actual gods!  And here in America, our president, well, let's just say he talks to some interesting people.\n\nThen there's stuff like what happened in Tiananmen Square back in '89.  A bunch of students and intellectuals just wanted to speak up, but the government got all violent.  They say only a couple hundred people died, but others say it was thousands! And then there's the Rwandan genocide, where people were killed just because of who they were.  And of course, you can't forget Hitler and the Nazis.  They were all about killing anyone they didn't like.\n\nIt's just, like, sad and scary, you know?",
            "So, check it out, this dude Duke Ellington, right? He's a big deal in the jazz world. He stuck around for ages, which means he got super good at making his band sound awesome.  You know, he doesn't always play piano super loud in his songs, but as a composer, he was a total genius. He wrote these crazy complex tunes that let each musician shine. He'd build a framework where soloists could go wild, but also make these tight, organized sections that showed off each player's style.  He knew how to make the whole band sound like one big, awesome machine.\n\nThis one dictionary, The Grove Music Dictionary, says Ellington was always using his singers like instruments.  They talk about a song called \"Creole Love Call\" where he does this thing where the singer just makes sounds, like a totally new kind of instrument. It's like, forget the words, it's all about the feeling.  And he was always making sure the singers and the instruments worked together perfectly, which is pretty cool.\n\n\"Creole Love Call\" is this slow, bluesy song with six parts, each one different.\n\n* **Part 1:**  The singer and the wind instruments go back and forth, like a conversation. The singer starts smooth, then gets kinda rougher at the end.\n* **Part 2:**  A trumpet player comes in with a muted trumpet – think of it like a cool echo of the tune.  He plays some really long notes, adding this bluesy flavor.\n* **Part 3:**  The clarinet player takes over, playing high and fast. The piano adds these little, off-beat notes that make it all swing.\n* **Part 4:**  The whole band jumps in, echoing the first part with the brass and wind instruments trading lines.\n* **Part 5:**  This is the big one! The wind instruments start singing back and forth in their highest range, and the brass and drums play a crazy fast beat, like it’s about to explode!\n* **Part 6:**  Back to the beginning, but the singer is sounding rougher now, almost like they're growling, making their voice sound like an instrument.\n* **The end:** A quick little finish with the singer running up and down the scale, and then, BOOM! A trombone plays a weird note that just hangs in the air.\n\n Ellington was always finding new ways to use his singers, adding this extra color to his music.\n\nIn another song called \"Hot and Bothered,\" he does this cool thing with a trumpet player and a singer. They take turns playing and singing, and their voices and instruments blend together like they were meant to be. And then in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\"  he uses this trombone player named Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton to start the song. It's like he knew exactly how to make each musician sound their best.",
            "This girl, man, she was always chasing after somethin'. It started when she hit her teens, like, at 14.  This need, this emptiness, it just wouldn't quit. By the time she hit 17, she figured out she wanted someone, not some shiny thing. But boys? Pfft.  They tried, those goofy dudes, all awkward smiles and fumbled attempts to win her over. But nothin' worked. She just wasn't feelin' it. It was like a mystery, this whole \"un-woo-able\" thing. She wracked her brain, tried to figure it out, but nothin' stuck. So she just kept on livin', always wonderin' about this hole inside her. \n\nLife at home was usually chill. Her parents were cool, laid-back folks. They never fought, and arguments with their daughter were, like, super rare. The only time things got heated was when she tried to spread her wings and be her own person.  She was the chill kid of super chill parents, but she brought the energy, you know?  Her personality was big time, and people loved her for it. \n\nBut today, things were off. She was wanderin' around the house, lookin' for some spark of inspiration, when BAM! A scream ripped through the air, her mom's voice, all panicked. She bolted into the kitchen, heart pounding, \"Mom! What's wrong?!\" Her mom was sprawled on the floor, lookin' all messed up, whimpering \"Ow\" between breaths. The daughter rushed to her side, \"Mom, tell me what happened!\"\n\nHer mom, voice shaky, managed, \"Sweetheart... I need you to take me to... the hospital.\" She was in bad shape, her daughter could tell.  \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\"  Her mom gestured weakly, and the daughter, thankful she'd taken those self-defense classes, scooped her up and carried her to the car. \n\nThe hospital was a whirlwind of smells: disinfectant, sickness, and fear.  But she was too focused on her mom to feel it. She rushed her inside, screaming for help. Doctors swarmed around, whisked her mom away on a gurney.  Her daughter, left alone, sat in a chair, worry gnawing at her. Turns out, her mom had tried to grab a vase from a high shelf and tumbled off a step stool.",
            "Alright, so picture this: there's this super healthy way of eating called the \"Mediterranean Diet,\" or Med diet for short.  It's all about lots of fruits, veggies, nuts, whole grains, and fish, with less meat and fat.  Think of it like a giant salad bar with a side of delicious fish!\n\nWell, some brainiacs wanted to see if this Med diet could actually keep your ticker in tip-top shape and prevent heart problems.  They called it the \"aMed diet\" and even made a special score to see how well people followed it. Turns out, folks who ate like they were on a Mediterranean vacation had WAY less heart attacks and strokes.\n\nThis wasn't just some random guess, though. A bunch of smart nurses filled out questionnaires about what they ate for like, twenty years straight.  They even checked their medical records to make sure everything was on the up and up. And guess what? The nurses who ate the most Med-style grub were way less likely to have a heart attack or stroke.\n\nSo, basically, if you wanna live a long, healthy life, maybe start loading up on that Mediterranean goodness!",
            "Back in 2007, America went through a rough patch, like, super rough. People lost their jobs left and right, houses were worth nothin', and even big companies went belly up. This whole mess, it's still kinda hangin' around today. So, what went wrong? Well, let's just say some folks in charge made some bad calls, ya know? They pushed banks and companies to give out loans to folks who weren't exactly the best at paying 'em back. Meanwhile, these two big fellas, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, kept buyin' up these bad loans and stuffin' 'em into these fancy packages. Like, they thought they could sell 'em off like hotcakes. But when people couldn't pay, BAM! The whole thing came crashin' down.\n\nSee, this whole thing started way back in '99 when President Clinton was tryin' to get re-elected. He wanted to look good, ya know? So, he loosened up the rules about loans, which kinda set the stage for this whole mess seven years down the line. One guy, Steven Holmes from the New York Times, he was like, \"Whoa, this ain't gonna end well.\" He saw what was comin', but nobody listened.\n\nSo, now we had these newfangled mortgages, like the ones with interest rates that changed all the time. Plus, these crazy things called mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations. It's like they were tryin' to make everything more complicated than it needed to be. Everyone got so mixed up in the housing market, they forgot to watch their own wallets.\n\nThen, boom! The bubble burst. All those banks and companies that had bought up those fancy mortgage packages were in big trouble. They were drownin' in debt, and the big players, like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, went down in flames.  Fannie and Freddie, those two mortgage giants, they were in trouble too. They were so deep in debt, the government had to step in and take over. \n\nIt was a real mess, man.",
            "Alright, let's talk about exposition. That part of your story where you're supposed to dazzle readers with your fancy writing, you know, the part where everyone's hanging on your every word or... they're hitting that \"Back\" button and muttering curses under their breath. Dr. Merlin, a writing guru I know, she gets pretty riled up when she encounters too much exposition. It's like watching paint dry, only less exciting.\n\nYou writers out there, you already know the golden rule: \"Show, don't tell.\" But even the best of us sometimes fall into the trap of info-dumps, paragraphs and paragraphs of nothing happening, or worse, way too much happening all at once. Exposition is like that little voice in your ear whispering, \"Get the backstory out of the way so you can get to the juicy parts!\"  It's that same voice that makes you want to tell the reader every single detail about every character's childhood.\n\nExposition is basically just telling your audience what happened, usually in a plain and boring way. Think of those long, winded explanations in movies where one character lays out a whole history lesson to another. In writing, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nHere's an example. Imagine you're reading a story where the heroine meets her true love, they have a fancy wedding, and then, bam! He's murdered right in front of her. Would you want to read two whole pages about this, with only a couple of lines of dialogue from each character? Probably not. You'd want the author to spend some time developing the husband's character. Make him come alive through his words, his actions, showing how deeply he loves his wife. You'd want to see how her life changed and improved because of him, in big and small ways.\n\nA good introduction to the husband would make you care about what happens to him, and it would give you a better understanding of the heroine. You'd mourn his death with her, and that would make you feel more connected to her.\n\nBasically, you want to give your readers something more than just the bare bones of the story. You want to give them the juicy stuff, the details that make the story come alive.\n\nSometimes it's tempting to rush past important details. You might have a new character who used to be in the Air Force, now he's a gas station night manager, he's been married twice, no kids, loves fishing, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast. Give us the details!",

See, I was watchin' NBC 4 this mornin', August 13th, and this dude named Shad Hostettler, looked like a real scumbag, ya know? Stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. They didn't even say her name, but they showed his mugshot, and boy, did he look evil! They only talked about it for a couple minutes 'cause it was still happening, but they said he stabbed her a bunch of times and got arrested.\n\nThen they talked about some kid named Travis Buyers, 18, got shot up in Sharon Woods early that mornin'. Critically injured, they said, but no arrests yet. SWAT team's on the case. Seemed like they rushed through that one, though. Maybe 'cause he was a black kid, ya know? I've noticed that before, always seems like the media goes crazy over white folks, but black folks, well, it's like they don't even exist sometimes.\n\nNext up, some genius shot a hole in a Med-Flight chopper with a .22 rifle. They were talkin' about where it happened and stuff. Crime Stoppers offered five grand for any tips leading to the shooter. \n\nThen they threw in some weather stuff - rain and thunderstorms comin' Saturday. Short and sweet, like they wanted ya to keep watchin'.\n\nFollowed that with a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. Some dude, supposedly black, wearing a hoodie, about six feet tall and 150 pounds, robbed the place. They kept sayin' he was black and how dark his skin was, seemed kinda weird to me.\n\nFinally, they talked about this Rene Rodriguez, some big-shot drug dealer from Texas. Convicted of sendin' weed to Ohio. Instead of sayin' 25 years, they said \"300 months\". Like that made it sound worse or somethin'. And they kept sayin' he was Hispanic, not sure why that mattered.",
            "Brothers, man, they're somethin' else.  Like, there's this crazy bond between 'em, ya know? It's like, unbreakable, like a freakin' steel cable.  But it's more than just good stuff, like love and all that.  There's jealousy, anger, even that messed-up stuff like cruelty, thrown in there too.  \n\nBrothers, they get each other like nobody else.  It's like lookin' in a mirror, seein' yourself straight up.  But when things get really rough, that's when this bond, it really shows its true colors.  And let me tell ya, sometimes those colors can be pretty darn ugly. \n\nSee, understandin' what brothers feel, it ain't easy.  It's like a rollercoaster of emotions, and the consequences, well, they can be a real pain in the neck.\n\nYou see it all the time, these brothers, starin' each other dead in the eyes, seein' their own reflection.  Not how others see 'em, but the real deal, the good, the bad, the whole shebang.  And in their actions, in the stuff they do and the stuff that happens because of it, that's where you see their true colors, their real character. \n\nThis story, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" it's all about that.  These two brothers, they're like two sides of the same coin, full of all these crazy emotions, tossin' 'em around like it's nothin'.  They go on this wild ride, this journey, and it's a real tearjerker. \n\nOne brother, he's got this big ol' pride thing goin' on.  He wants a brother who can keep up, who can do all the cool stuff, you know? But his little brother, Doodle, he's different. He can't keep up, he's always slowin' him down. And the older brother, well, he starts gettin' all resentful, even angry.",
            "Man, my brain is like this crazy computer, but way cooler! Back in the day, people thought it was like a wax thing or a scroll, but now we know better. It's more like a super-powered machine that takes in all kinds of stuff from the world around us, like sounds, smells, and stuff you can touch. \n\nIt's all about how your brain takes these signals and makes sense of them. It's like a team effort, with different parts working together. First, it breaks things down into tiny bits, like figuring out what colors are where and what shapes are what. Then, it uses what it already knows to help figure things out faster. Like, if you see a black box on a white background, your brain already knows what a box looks like, so it can zoom right in and say, \"Hey, that's a box!\"\n\nBut hold on, there's more! Your brain's also got this super-focus thing called attention. It's like a spotlight that shines on the most important stuff. So, you might be looking at your shoes, but your brain's mostly ignoring all the tiny blades of grass. But if someone says your name, BAM! Your brain's all over it.\n\nAnd get this, your brain stores all this information! It's got different memory places, like a short-term memory for things you're thinking about right now and a long-term memory for everything else. It's how you remember your best friend's birthday or how to ride a bike.\n\nScientists are still trying to figure out exactly how all this works, but they have some pretty cool ideas. One idea is that your brain is like a giant network of connections, with each connection representing a thought or idea.",
            "Okay, so picture this: there's this book called \"Brave New World\" by this dude Huxley, right? He's basically saying that all this fancy technology and the whole \"gotta keep buying stuff\" thing is gonna mess us up big time. See, in this world, folks are all about being part of the group and getting their instant happiness fix. They're practically brainwashed from the get-go to chase after pleasure and forget about being themselves. It's like they're all playing a game, but they don't even know they're pawns!  \n\nThis Huxley dude, he's got this angle that kinda sounds like Marxism. You know, the whole idea that things ain't always fair and that the rich folks are using us for their own gain?  Huxley throws around words like \"homogeny\" and \"reification,\" which basically mean everyone's the same and stuff gets turned into just a thing to be bought and sold. It's like he's saying the whole system is rigged against the little guy.\n\nHe's also got this sharp point about how people in \"Brave New World\" are tricked into thinking they're happy even though they're not. They're so focused on getting the latest gadget or having the coolest clothes that they don't even see the bigger picture. It's like they're wearing a pair of rose-colored glasses, but those glasses are blinding them to the truth.\n\nAnd get this, the way those upper-class folks just go along with everything, even though they know it's messed up, that's kinda like what Marx talked about too! He called it \"hegemony,\" basically one group of people controlling everything while the rest just go along with it.\n\nThen there's this whole thing about relationships. Or, rather, the lack of them.  Everyone's so busy chasing after their own pleasure that they don't have time for real connections. It's all surface level, like they're just going through the motions.\n\nHuxley might be saying that technology and capitalism are sucking the soul out of humanity. No time for love, no time for deep thoughts, just endless consumerism and shallow interactions. It's kinda scary, you know?",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this college campus, man. I've been here for a couple years now, and let me tell ya, getting around this place is a real pain in the butt.  My freshman year, I lived way out east, practically on the edge of the world.  Getting to classes in some random building like Willard, which is, like, in the middle of everything, took forever. \n\nAbout 25 minutes, walking, especially if the weather was being a total jerk, which, let's be real, happens all the time here in State College. I heard from one of my buddies who just graduated that back in the day, there was, like, tons of empty space between the East Halls dorms and the rest of campus. Now, they've built a bunch of new stuff: sports fields, fancy buildings like the Creamery and a new health center, even apartments. \n\nAs the campus keeps growing, it's getting harder and harder to get from point A to point B. What's the best way to solve this mess? Bikes, baby! But it's not just about having bikes, the whole campus needs to be built for bikers. I was talking to this dude the other day who got back into biking after a long break, and he said, \"Bikes are awesome! It's the only way to get around.\"\n\nBesides being good for you, biking is the fastest and most efficient way to travel. You can easily cruise 30 miles on a bowl of oatmeal and some pedaling.  I live off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms.  The best decision I made this year was buying a bike. My classes are in Thomas building, which is, like, a 25-minute walk from my place. But on my bike? Bam! 5 minutes flat if I really push it! \n\nThe only problem is, Pollock Road is the fastest way to get there, but it ain't always the safest for biking.  Walking is cool too, but I'm too busy for that. If I didn't have my bike, I'd be stuck walking everywhere.  Walking to Thomas every day would be an extra 30-40 minutes each way, that's over two and a half hours a week!  And that's just for one class! Add on all the other stuff, and that's way too much time wasted."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "So, I'm thinkin' about becoming a social worker, ya know? Figured I'd go with the Division of Family and Children Services and help out those kids who've had a rough go of it, the ones who've been abused or forgotten.  I wanna lend a hand to families too, 'cause sometimes they just need a little extra support.  \n\nSee, for me, social work ain't just a job, it's a way of life. I've always wanted to help people, but I didn't know how 'til I figured out what I was good at.  I went to college and got my degree in Psychology, but I still felt like something was missing.\n\nThen one summer, I met this kid, just sixteen, sitting on my friend's couch lookin' like he'd seen a ghost. Turns out, he was runnin' from his parents, who weren't exactly the nicest folks. I didn't know what to do, but I knew I had to help. I talked to the cops, told 'em I was a psychology grad.  They asked me to talk to the parents 'cause they couldn't do much for the kid.  Man, those parents were somethin' else! They were all nervous and makin' excuses about their son bein' a manipulator. It was a wake-up call for me. That's when I knew I wanted to be a social worker, someone who could actually make a difference for kids like him.\n\nAnd let's talk about social justice, somethin' that's super important in this field.  Society always talks about how much it cares about individuals, but then it tries to cram everyone into the same mold.  Why can't we celebrate our differences instead of tryin' to be just like everyone else?  I've always been my own person, standin' up for what I believe in.  I protested against injustice whenever I could, dyed my hair crazy colors, wore clothes that showed who I was, even joined the GSBA.  I'm all about fightin' for what's right, and social work is the perfect way to do that.",
            "This piece is gonna break down the sleep-trouble thingy called insomnia, lookin' at why it happens. We'll check out two main ideas: what's going on inside ya (the biological stuff) and what's happening around ya (the sociocultural stuff).\n\nFirst off, let's talk about sleep problems in general. You got your main sleep trouble types: the ones that stand alone (like insomnia), the ones that come with other mental stuff (like anxiety or depression), and the ones caused by stuff like medical stuff or drugs.\n\nNow, insomnia is a real pain. It's when you can't fall asleep or stay asleep, and it's been bugging ya for at least a month. Then there are other sleep issues like oversleeping (hypersomnia) or narcolepsy, which is when ya suddenly fall asleep, even when you don't want to.\n\nSo, the \"what's inside ya\" idea says that genes and your body's insides play a big role. There's this part of your brain called the hypothalamus, which has special cells called orexins that tell you when to sleep and when to wake.\n\nOne study found that these orexin cells have something called GABAB receptors, which are like tiny switches that control sleep. When these switches are turned on, it makes you sleepy. But if they're messed up, well, that could be why you can't sleep!\n\nNow, the \"what's around ya\" idea says that your life stuff matters too. Your job, your family, your money – all that stuff can affect your sleep. Imagine if you're stressed out because you're worried about money or work – it's gonna be hard to sleep!",
            "Alright, listen up! Let's talk about this thing called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short. It's basically when your brain has trouble makin' sense of sounds, even if your ears are workin' just fine. Think of it like this: your ears are like a radio receiver, pickin' up all the signals, but the brain is the speaker, and sometimes the speaker is messed up. \n\nSo, how do you know if someone's got CAPD? Well, there are some red flags, like havin' trouble followin' conversations in a noisy place, mixin' up words, or missin' things when someone's talkin'. It's not that they're not listenin', it's just their brain's havin' a hard time sortin' out all the noise.\n\nNow, imagine you're a teacher in a regular classroom. What can ya do to help a kid with CAPD? Well, ya gotta be patient and creative.  Maybe try lettin' them sit closer to the front,  use visual aids, and break down instructions into smaller steps.  Remember, everyone learns differently, and with a little extra help, kids with CAPD can still succeed!",
            "Listen up, folks!  This play, Twelfth Night, it's like, totally saying that while disguises are great for pulling off con games for a long time, eventually, you gotta ditch the fake persona or you're gonna lose yourself completely.  The thing is, stopping the charade can be a real pain in the neck 'cause you might end up alienating all your friends. So, it's a tough call:  stay true to yourself or keep the peace? Some people are cool with being tricked, but others? Not so much. They'll be totally offended. \n\nNow, pretending to be the opposite gender is a whole other can of worms. Why do people even bother with that?  Why ditch your real identity and pretend to be someone you're not?  Well, in Viola's case, it's all about survival. She's in a strange land, and she needs to protect herself from creepy dudes.  So, she becomes Cesario, a dude. It works, but it also cuts her off from other women, which is kinda a bummer.  \n\nGet this – she's so good at playing a guy that Olivia, this rich lady, totally falls for her!   \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" She's even got Orsino, who's like, totally into her, but she's pretending to be a dude! It's a mess! \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\"  \n\nSo, maybe this play is saying that pretending can help people figure out their true feelings? Or maybe not.  Olivia's all over Cesario, but is that because he's a guy or is she secretly into women?  Who knows?  \n\nShakespeare's got a way of making you think, you know? He's like, \"What's real anyway?\"",
            "Alright, so listen up!  This whole German colonial thing, yeah?  It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, especially for the Ovaherero and Nama people in South West Africa.  Talk about a massacre!  But hey, you can't just paint a whole empire with one brush, right?  Germany had a bunch of different colonies, each with its own style. \n\nSame goes for schools.  When the Brits took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they were surprised to find a bunch of educated folks already there.  Seems those Germans did a decent job in some places.  But then you got South West Africa, which was a whole different story.  \n\nUnlike East Africa where the government built schools and stuff, in South West Africa, they left it all to the missionaries.  Those missionaries got some government support, but not much.  Meanwhile, the Germans were all about educating their own people, building fancy schools and supporting those missionary ones too.  This messed things up big time for South West Africa. While other colonies had tons of educated Africans, South West Africa was like, \"Nah, we good.\" Most folks there were still stuck in the dark ages, can't read, can't write, you know the drill.\n\nWhy the big difference?  Well, that's what this paper's all about.  We gotta dig into the whole settler scene and figure out what the bigwigs were thinking.  There's a ton of books about German schools, mostly written back in the day, but we need to take a closer look at what went on in South West Africa.  Some smart folks like Cohen have already compared South West Africa to East Africa and found some clues.  They think the big white population in South West Africa had a lot to do with it.\n\nSouth West Africa wasn't as hot and sweaty as some other colonies, but they still had a ton of desert.  And guess what?  More white folks wanted to live there! By 1913, almost 15,000 whites were calling South West Africa home, way more than any other colony.",
            "Man, music these days is wild! Like, there's so many different kinds of music now, it's crazy. Rock, pop, rap, country, jazz, folk—you name it, there's a genre for it. And get this, each of those genres has like, a million sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. It's like a never-ending musical family tree!\n\nBut let's talk about heavy metal, because that's where things get really interesting. That stuff's been around for ages, but it's exploded in the last 40 years. Heavy metal is all about feeling things, you know? And not the happy-go-lucky kind of feelings either. We're talking dark, intense emotions, the kind that make you wanna headbang until your head falls off. \n\nIt's also super diverse. People realized early on that heavy metal wasn't just one thing, it was a whole playground for creativity. So they started making their own sub-genres, then sub-sub-genres, and so on. \n\nNow it's like, what even IS heavy metal anymore? It's borrowed stuff from every other genre, but it still has that core, that dark, powerful energy.  \n\nTo understand heavy metal today, you gotta understand where it came from. It's more than just music, it's a movement. A movement fueled by darkness, loudness, and a whole lotta attitude.\n\nThink about it: more bass, more volume, more guitars screaming, more theatricality. It's like the music scene said \"screw subtlety\" and cranked everything up to 11.\n\nAnd yeah, let's not forget the drugs. The 70s were wild, man. All those psychedelics made people think differently, do different things, make different music. And heavy metal was born from that chaos.\n\nThey weren't afraid to explore the dark side of life, something that was kinda taboo in mainstream music back then. They drew inspiration from the Romantics, those poets who were all about intense feelings and dark themes.  \n\nEven the Beatles got in on the action. Their song \"Helter Skelter\" is a prime example. It's raw, it's chaotic, it's a glimpse into the darkness that was brewing.",
            "Alright, so picture this: before all those fancy Surrealist dudes were painting their crazy dreams, there was this guy, Henri Rousseau. He was like, way ahead of his time. This dude wasn't just painting dreams, he was *living* them, ya know? His famous painting, \"The Dream,\" from 1910, shows this lady totally blown away by the cool stuff she sees in her dream. But here's the kicker - it's also about Rousseau's own dreams, like, what he wanted out of life as an artist.  \n\nSee, he always wanted people to get his art, to be all \"WOW, this guy's amazing!\" But there was this big problem: he had this crazy fight going on inside his head. Should he paint like everyone else to get famous, or should he just do his own thing and be different? \"The Dream\" is like his big, messy answer to that question.\n\nNow, to understand what's going on, you gotta know a little about this guy. He was born way back in 1844 in a dusty French town. His dad was some kind of rich merchant, but Rousseau didn't get any fancy art training. He spent years working for the government, collecting taxes and stuff, until he was like, forty! Then, tragedy struck - his wife and almost all his kids died.  He decided to paint to escape his sadness and start fresh. Unlike those other artists who painted fancy pictures of peasants, Rousseau was a regular guy with regular dreams.\n\nRousseau really, really wanted to be a big deal in the art world.  He was starting late, and all these other artists were already famous. He was like, \"Hey, I'm good too!\" but nobody was listening.  This other artist, Matisse, was getting all the attention, and Rousseau was stuck in the shadows. This guy Gordon wrote a book about French art, and he said that Matisse was all about being different and unique, while Rousseau just wanted to paint something so normal that people would finally accept him.",
            "So, lotsa brainy folks, like, way smarter than me, think there's a super close link between being good and lookin' good, you know, like truth and beauty.  I kinda get it. Like, that poet Keats, he said somethin' like, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - that's all you need to know.\" \n\nWe learn stuff, right? Like, history, math, all that, but stuff like right and wrong, and what's pretty... that just feels different.  It's not like someone taught us to like a sunset or feel bad when someone's mean. It's just... there.\n\nThink about it. We can try to explain what makes art great or what makes somethin' right, but it's kinda hard to put it into words. You ever try to tell someone why you love a certain song? You might say somethin' about the beat, or the lyrics, but it ain't the whole story, ya know? There's just this... *something*\n\nSame with good stuff like kindness or honesty. We can talk about why it's important, but it's more than just words. It's like, deep down, you just *know* it's good.\n\nThat's why I think art and good stuff are connected.  They're both kinda magical, ya know? They move us in ways we can't always explain. It's like this feeling you get when you read a super good book, or see a painting that just blows you away. It's more than just pretty colors or a good story. It's somethin' deeper.",
            "So, lemme tell ya about Germany, alright? It's a powerhouse, a real unified crew, with its own crazy cool culture, from the Alps in München all the way to the Baltic Sea in Kiel.  You feel the same vibe from Köln on the Rhine to Dresden in Saxony by the Elbe.  It's a mix of all sorts of stuff, ya know?  \n\nSee, Germany's got a wild history, a whole bunch of different tribes and stuff that came together to make it what it is today.  Folks call this ancient land \"Germania,\" but where that name came from, well, that's a mystery even smarter folks than me can't solve. Tacitus, this old dude who wrote about Germans way back when, thought it came from a tribe called the Tungrians. They were called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and went head-to-head with the Gauls, ya see. (Tacitus, 98, get it?  Like, 98 AD!)  Then there's Julius Caesar, who, back in the day, used the word \"Germanus\" to talk about these pesky tribes he was fighting near the Rhine.  He nicked it from the Gauls, probably, a way to tell who he'd conquered and who he hadn't. Some think it was just a neighborly term in Gaulish, you know, like \"Hey, those Germans over there.\" (Names of Germany) Other folks say it came from the spear they used, called a \"ger,\" or maybe it meant \"shouty\" in some old language, 'cause Germans were known for being loud. (O.E.D, 2010, whatever that means).\n\nThis other Roman dude, Tacitus, wrote a book called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" way back in 98 AD. It's about where Germans came from, and he's like, \"These guys?  They're the real deal, no mixing with other folks, they just *were*.  Nobody would leave Asia or Africa for this wild, cold, grumpy place unless it was home, right?\" (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who'd want to leave Rome for Germania?  Not the Romans, not at first anyway.  But they'd send their guys out to get stuff and fight the occasional battle, but mostly, they went back to their big ol' empire.\n\nSo, these Germanic tribes, they were hanging out on the edge of Rome's land, trading their stuff and even fighting for Rome in their army.  (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17)",
            "Man, I was staring at this thing, my brain just kinda... empty. Not thinking, just seeing. Like, super focused but not really 'getting' it, y'know? Thoughts were popping in and out, but nothin' stuck. It was like my mind was just... flowing with what I was looking at.\n\nThis artist pal once told me to check out this book, \"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" or somethin'.  Always wanted to draw, ever since I was a kid, and this book was supposed to teach ya how, like, what a pencil is and how your brain even sees lines. \n\nOne trick in there is to picture a box around whatever ya lookin' at.  Like, say you've got a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen that's connected to a dining room, bam! Now it's just the bowl of fruit, simple as that.\n\nBut staring at this thing... I couldn't do it. It was just too much, too mind-blowing. Picasso had his blue stuff, Monet went crazy for green, Renaissance dudes loved all the colors.  My art was gonna be different, man, this was gonna be \"Work in Brown,\" the start of my masterpiece.\n\nSo I grabbed my tool, muscles gettin' tense and loose as I moved my hand, like, my mind was telling my hand what to do.  Water was swirlin', smooth and clear, and stuff was breakin' off and just... gone.  Muscles gettin' jumpy, I slammed the toilet handle again.  This brown thing wasn't budging, stuck like a bug on the bottom.\n\nMop in hand, feet apart, tie chokin' me, I frowned at this mess someone left for us bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid.  A few more flushes, a few more moments of peaceful thinkin', then I grabbed the toilet paper, wrapped it around my hand like a giant oven mitt, and dove in. Just like a mom checkin' on the turkey in the oven...",
            "Yo, check this out.  Junior drivers are croakin' behind the wheel, man. It's a real bummer. Why? Well, the brainiacs at the National Institutes of Health say those teen brains ain't quite ready for the insanity of the road yet.  And, let's face it, they're green as grass. Not only do they cause more wrecks, but they're more likely to flip their cars, speed like crazy, and end up in the ditch.  \n\nTalk about a recipe for disaster!\n\nAnd get this, having your buddies in the car makes it even worse.  Some smarty-pants in California did a study and found that the more passengers a teen has, the more likely they are to crash.  Duh!\n\nSo, some states are tryin' to fix this mess by giving teens these temporary licenses that limit their driving time and how many friends can tag along.  But, honestly, that's just a band-aid on a gaping wound. The real problem is that teen drivers, statistically speaking, are just not cut out for the dangers of the road.  This psychologist dude, Marvin Zuckerman, thinks 18 is even too young to get a license.  He says teenagers are wired to take risks just for the rush, which, let's be real, is a bad combo with a steering wheel.  \n\nWe gotta delay driving until they're a little older, when they've calmed down and don't feel the need to live life on the edge.  Otherwise, we're gonna have a highway full of carnage.  Just you wait—the Baby Boomers' kids are gonna be hitting the road soon, and that's a whole lot of new drivers with questionable skills.\n\nHere's what we need: a national law that says no one under 18 can drive. Schools can still teach 'em about driving, but no keys until they're older.  We can still have those temporary permits and practice hours, but no exceptions.  That way, we can keep everyone safe.\n\nIt ain't rocket science, folks.",
            "So, I was digging through these old Edison movies at the Library of Congress, you know, the ones from way back when. I found fifteen of these \"trick films\" from between 1895 and 1901. These flicks, they're all about tricking your eyes with clever editing. Basically, I wanted to figure out how they made these tricks work and see if any of them got fancy later on. \n\nMost of the time, these early trick films were pretty simple. They were like little plays, all set up in front of a camera like a stage. No fancy camera moves, just straight-ahead shots of people doing their thing.  Think of it like a vaudeville show, but on film! You know, the audience always sees the whole picture at once, just like on a stage. \n\nThese tricksters mostly stuck to long shots or medium shots, never getting close-up on anyone's face.  They even kept the action limited to side-to-side movements  - no walking towards or away from the camera. Like in this film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" from 1900, the actors just walk back and forth, never leaving that stage-like area. \n\nAnd get this, each trick film was usually just one long shot, like a single scene.  They couldn't really tell a full story because they were so short. They were more like little magic tricks or gags, lasting maybe a minute or less. \n\nBut here's the kicker: what looks like one shot to us might actually be several shots spliced together to make the illusion work. Take \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" from 1895, for example.  If you watch closely, you'll see the moment where they switch out the \"head\" – it's like a hidden camera trick!",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya 'bout this dude John Taylor, real upstanding guy, straight outta Caroline. This fella was all about the Republican thing, ya know?  Didn't matter that he was a farmer, that life and his little stint in politics made him a real firebrand when it came to folks' freedom and how the government should run things. He was all about farms and stuff, thought it was the best job in the world, and that's what shaped his whole take on the government, the Constitution, even the courts.\n\nSee, John thought America had a shot at gettin' things right 'cause we didn't have no old traditions messin' things up. We could build somethin' new, somethin' based on people takin' care of themselves. He was a real believer in rights, the kind you're born with, that can't be touched by the government.  He figured if you mess with one right, they all start to crumble.  And he thought the idea of a \"state of nature\" where the strong just bulldoze the weak was a load of baloney. Civilization should be better than that.\n\nTo make this perfect society, John thought we needed a government that knew folks are a mix of good and bad. He was hard-line on that, thought we gotta be honest about it. He said,\"Government's run by people, so it's gonna have all the good and bad that comes with 'em.\"  He thought good government protected your stuff, helped farmers, and kept big businesses in check. He figured even if the people runnin' things were greedy, a good system would still work out fair.\n\nJohn believed folks are driven by self-interest, but it ain't always bad. It's only bad when it makes folks want to screw over others.  A good government keeps that in check.  He was all about the Constitution, but he didn't think just readin' the words was enough. You gotta understand what the guys who wrote it meant.  He thought the Declaration of Independence was even more important 'cause it made it clear America was a bunch of separate states, not just one big country.",
            "So, check it out. We were tracking how many folks were ditching their cars for bikes or walking or whatever, right? But in month three, bam!  The numbers nosedived like a cheetah on roller skates. Kinda bummer, ya know?\n\nWinter hit New England, so maybe folks just stopped biking and walking as much.  Plus, December is crazy busy with school stuff ending and holidays kicking in.  People are probably too swamped with exams and gift-wrapping to remember to fill out those log sheets. \n\nThen, December turned into January, and everyone was on break. Like, no one even needs to be on campus! Then classes start up again in January, and, guess what? Still low numbers! \n\nYou know how it is, things get hyped up at first, then people kinda lose steam.  We tried to pump things up with a \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, and it worked! More people started logging their commutes.  \n\nBut here's the deal - keeping people interested when there's a natural lull, plus those big school breaks, is tough.  \n\nAnother thing? People love their cars. It's like, built into our brains! So, to get them to ditch the wheels, you gotta give 'em good reasons. \n\nWe gave away cool stuff like gift cards to local places – restaurants, coffee shops, even massages!  I wonder if something bigger, like a sweet bicycle or even a hybrid car, would have made a bigger splash.\n\nWe kept the prizes the same the whole time. Maybe if we'd upped the ante as things went on – maybe a couple bikes in December, then a hybrid or electric car in January – things might have stayed super pumped.",
            "Hold onto your hats, folks! Today we're diving deep into the wild world of ETFs, those fancy financial instruments that track stuff like stock indexes or even whole baskets of assets. Think of them like index funds, but way more flexible, like a stock you can buy and sell on the open market.  \n\nThese bad boys give you the best of both worlds: the spread-out protection of an index fund and the cool perks of owning individual stocks, like short selling, margin trading, and snagging just one share at a time. Oh, and did I mention they're usually cheaper to own than your average mutual fund? Talk about a win-win!\n\nBut hold up! There's always a catch, right? Well, with ETFs, you gotta cough up a commission every time you buy or sell, just like with regular stocks.  And while they offer a ton of choices, it's always smart to double-check if those benefits, like diversification, are really delivering the goods.\n\nToday, we're putting a popular ETF called IHF under the microscope. We're gonna compare it to its top ten holdings, which make up a whopping 63.58% of the whole shebang. These top dogs are like the VIPs of the ETF world, so if we understand them, we're halfway to understanding the whole crew.\n\nWe're gonna see if owning just these ten stocks would be just as good, or even better, than owning the whole IHF ETF.  Plus, we'll see if we can find a better way to mix and match these ten stocks to get even better returns, like a financial magic trick!  \n\nFirst, we'll crunch some numbers to figure out how these ten stocks contribute to the overall return and risk (or Beta) of the ETF. Then, we'll see if these two portfolios - the ETF and the top ten - are truly different, or just playing a game of chance. Stay tuned, folks, it's gonna be a wild ride!",
            "Alright, so check it out, this poem \"Dream-Land\" by Poe, he thinks it's pretty rad. Now, Poe uses this word \"Thulé\" a couple times, and some dude named Mabbott figured out it comes from this old dude Virgil. Virgil used it for this island way up north, like beyond the edge of the known world, ya know?  Virgil totally used it, but there's this other dude, Goethe, who Poe was digging big time. This Karl J. Arndt guy, he wrote a whole book about Poe and Goethe's poems, and he reckons Poe was basically copying Goethe.\n\nGoethe, man, he was a big deal. Wrote this epic poem called \"Faust,\" two parts, way back in the day.  Part two has this poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It's about this king whose wife kicks the bucket after giving him this goblet. He starts drowning his sorrows in booze, missing his queen like crazy.  Then he's all, \"Screw this,\" decides to join his wife, gives his stuff to his kids, except for the goblet, walks to a cliff, tosses the goblet in the ocean, closes his eyes, and bam! Dead. Pretty messed up, right?  \n\nSo, the King of Thulé and the dude in Poe's poem, they're kinda like mirror images, like Poe's own messed up feelings bottled up in this poem.  There was even this play version of Faust in 1842,  just before Poe used \"Thulé\" in his other poem, \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" \n\nPoe uses \"Thulé\" twice in his poems, like bookends, but \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land,\" they're like buddies. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about how dark and lonely Thulé is, haunted by dead friends, everything's gray and depressing. Sounds a lot like how the King of Thulé feels after his wife dies, right? \n\nGoethe was a big deal, and Poe would have known him, even if it was just because he liked Tennyson. Plus, Goethe's stuff was everywhere back then.",
            "Okay, lemme tell ya about this crazy case I heard about. So there's this lady, Jennifer, right? She slipped and fell on some spilled applesauce in a grocery store called D&D. Ouch! Turns out, the manager, Paul, knew about the mess 'cause two employees told him about it. But guess what? He was too busy eating dinner!  Thirty minutes passed and BAM! Jennifer goes down!  \n\nNow, Jennifer's lawyer wants to go after Paul big time with \"punitive damages\". That means like, extra money to punish him 'cause they think he was super reckless. See, in California, you can get those if someone acts really bad on purpose, or just plain stupid and doesn't care if someone gets hurt. And in this case, they think Paul fits the bill.  \n\nThey're going to argue that Paul knew this store was a slip-and-slide! Apparently, there'd been five other falls that year already! But nope, he still wouldn't clean it up.  \n\nIt's a bit of a stretch to say he was \"despicable,\" but hey, it's California, anything goes!  They're gonna try to convince the judge that Paul was playing with fire and Jennifer got burned. \n\nTheir story goes like this:  It was a Friday afternoon, 5 p.m. sharp.  One of Paul's guys, Rich, tells him about the applesauce. Paul's like, \"Dude, I'm on a break, go away!\" Then another employee, Mary, tries to warn him again, and guess what? Same response!  \n\nFinally, at 5:30, poor Jennifer slips and falls, and ouch, she really hurt her back. So now she's suing D&D for all the money they can get.  It's gonna be a showdown in court!",
            "Man, lemme tell ya, four years ago I took this Islam class at CBC, and let me tell ya, things got heated! We were debating whether Islam was a bad religion or not, and it feels even more important today than ever. It's crazy how things have changed since 9/11.  I mean, back then the media was all over Islam, sayin' it was bad news, and now it's like everyone loves it!  Heck, we even got a president named Barack Obama, who's got Muslim roots, can you believe it?!\n\nNow, this book about Muhammad's life, it got me thinkin'. See, I thought Muhammad was a tough guy, conquering tribes and forcing them to become Muslims, but this book paints him as this misunderstood martyr, a humble dude who people just naturally flocked to. It's kinda strange, like they're trying to make him look like some kinda Jesus figure.\n\nAnd get this, there are some crazy similarities between Jesus and Muhammad. Like, there's this story where Muhammad turns some mutton and milk into enough food for forty guys!  It's like they're tryin' to make Muhammad look like some kinda miracle worker, which, you know, kinda steals thunder from Jesus, if you ask me.\n\nThe book's full of stories about people converting to Islam, but a lot of them come from, like, second or third hand accounts. It's all \"so-and-so told me, who heard it from so-and-so.\" It makes you wonder how true it all really is.\n\nThe thing that bugs me the most is how they try to make Muhammad out to be this perfect, gentle guy. But history tells a different story, man! He wasn't exactly Mr. Nice Guy. I gotta wonder if Muslims today even know the real story about how Muhammad got his power.",
            "Whoa, man, listen up!  So, you know how Jesus taught his stuff, right?  Well, after he, like, disappeared, Christianity went totally off the rails!  It's like, they added all this extra junk over time, making it way different from the original deal.  \n\nThese days, everyone's all about change and progress, ya know?  The old-school folks, they cling to what they know, but they're not gonna be able to stop the tide.  People are gonna start figuring out what was really important to Jesus, and ditch all the extra stuff.\n\nIt might take a while, maybe decades, maybe centuries, but it's gonna happen. Christianity's gonna go back to its roots, stripping away all the layers, like turning back time!  Eventually, we'll be worshipping just like they did back in Jesus' day, following only his teachings.\n\nThe churches will still be there, but everything will be way more unified.  No more different groups, no more arguments, just everyone on the same page.  Think of it like history reversing itself.  Remember how Christians used to get persecuted?  Then the Romans became Christian themselves!  Or how slavery ended and African-Americans rose to power?  \n\nThis big shift in Christianity is gonna be just like that.  It'll go back to the source, back to what Jesus really taught, and it'll bring everyone together.  The key is understanding that Jesus' words were meant metaphorically, not literally.  \n\nSo, what happened after Jesus?  Well, before Jesus, there was Judaism, the starting point for it all.  The Jews believed in one God, had scriptures they considered divinely inspired, and they were all about that religious authority.",
            "Man, lemme tell ya about this book, \"The Jungle.\" It's like, a real eye-opener about how messed up people can get when they're all about money and power. I mean, these factory owners, they're like, obsessed with makin' their businesses bigger and richer, no matter who they step on along the way. They're practically demons, those guys.\n\nTake a look at this line from the book: \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\".  It's like Upton Sinclair is sayin', \"Yo, look at this pollution! It's outta control!\"  These owners, they don't even care about the air we breathe or the animals gettin' hurt. They're like, \"more profit, more profit!\"  \n\nAnd forget about the workers, man. They're just pawns in this whole game. The owners squeeze 'em dry, makin' 'em work crazy hours, and then BAM! They're out on the street with nothin'. No warning, no nothin'. They don't even get a \"thank you\" for all their hard work.  Back then, there were no rules or nothin' to protect these poor dudes. They were stuck in a system that was rigged against 'em.\n\nIt's like they're slaves, man.  Sinclair even says, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"  Harsh, right?\n\nSo yeah, \"The Jungle\" shows how greedy and selfish humans can be when they're chasin' after money. It's a real wake-up call.",
            "So, you see, some writers are real slick, they use tricks to make you *feel* somethin' about stuff, ya know? Like, they pair words together that wouldn't normally hang out, just to make ya think a certain way. Or they pick symbols, like colors, and give 'em a secret meaning, then use 'em to make ya remember that feeling every time you see 'em. F. Scott Fitzgerald, the guy who wrote *The Great Gatsby*, he's a master of this stuff.\n\nHe does this whole thing with colors, like gold, green, white, gray, and even red and pink. He builds up this meaning, like a secret code, and then uses those colors to remind ya of that feeling later on.\n\nTake white and gray, for example. Fitzgerald uses these colors a lot, and he makes them mean somethin' special. White, it's like, fancy and all that, while gray is kinda old and faded. He throws these colors around everywhere at the start of the story. Daisy and Jordan, they're always dressed in white, like it's the only color they know. Even Nick, he's wearing white flannels at Gatsby's party, and Tom's got a white shirt on when he meets Myrtle. It's like everyone's wearin' white, and the only time they're not is when Nick's getting a vibe from Gatsby's party, and then it's all these crazy colors, like red and blue, nothin' fancy.\n\nThen Fitzgerald keeps throwin' white and gray at ya, like when Nick goes to work, he goes down \"white chasms,\" or when Gatsby's party guests are just \"gray names\" to Nick. Even places are white or gray, like the apartment buildings, the cars, the land, even people like that gray old dog-seller.\n\nSo, after you've seen white and gray everywhere, Fitzgerald uses 'em to show ya somethin' ain't important, or kinda boring. He uses this with Daisy, too. After a while, he describes her in all white, and suddenly, she doesn't seem so special anymore. She's just another white thing, somethin' Gatsby wants but ain't really real. He keeps doin' this with Daisy, makin' her seem like she's just a part of the pattern, not a real person.",
            "So, check this out. San Diego's a real hot spot for growing stuff, thanks to the killer weather. Tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers - they grow it all! And get this, people are going crazy for organic food here. Like, seriously, there are tons of farms selling it straight to folks, and they have waiting lists longer than my arm!  Organic eggs and milk are the faves, too.  \n\nThese organic farms are pretty cool. They give tours, let you hike around, birdwatch, the whole shebang. It's like a win-win: farmers get to be all green and stuff, and people get to learn about where their food comes from. Plus, they get government help for doing it, which is pretty sweet.\n\nNow, here's the thing about organic farming. It's awesome for the environment because it keeps the soil and water clean, which makes all sorts of plants and critters happy. But it's also a bit more work.  It takes extra effort to keep those pesky bugs and weeds away without chemicals, and sometimes you lose more crops. It's like trying to build a castle out of marshmallows - it looks great, but it might not be as strong as a regular brick one.  \n\nThen there are all these other things farmers do to help wildlife, like planting special plants, letting animals graze in different spots, and keeping those nasty invasive plants in check. All that extra work adds up, so it's no wonder farmers sometimes need a little help to make ends meet and keep the wildlife happy.\n\nSo, I found this cool piece of land near a town called Potrero. It's got all sorts of stuff growing on it - chaparral, grass, and oak trees - and it's right next to a big forest.  Lots of animals live there, some even endangered ones like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog.\n\nThis land has a cool history. Native Americans lived there for ages, then ranchers came along and raised cattle and chopped down trees for firewood.  It's been around for a long time, and now someone could make it into an awesome organic farm.\n\nI found a real farm doing this kind of stuff nearby and checked out what kind of help the government offers.  It's pretty inspiring to see people working hard to grow good food and protect nature at the same time.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya somethin' 'bout culture, see?  It's like, way more than just what ya see on the surface. It's like, a whole vibe, y'know? Ain't no two cultures exactly alike, and sayin' somethin' like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are nice\" is just plain wrong.  It's like, yeah, there might be some truths there, but everyone's different, right?  The real deal is to get a feel for what makes a culture tick, how it plays into the deal, and how their way of thinkin' might affect things. \n\nWhen you're dealin' with folks from a different place, you're gonna see it through your own lens, and that's natural. But tryin' to understand 'em means lookin' at their history, their beliefs, their whole deal. You gotta respect it, even if it's different from your own. Especially if you're the one with less to bargain with, ya know?  It's like, if you're walkin' into their turf, show 'em some respect, understand their rules, and things'll go smoother.\n\nNow, culture ain't just 'bout countries.  Even within a country, companies have their own vibes. Some are all about workin' hard, others are chill.  You can tell by how folks dress, how they talk, who they trust to do what.  Some companies encourage helpin' out, others are all about stickin' to the rules. Just look at all the different ways American companies operate, even in the same city.  And some cultures, they might seem more uniform at first, but that just means you gotta dig deeper, y'know?\n\nValues, that's the real key. They're like, the reason behind everything. If a culture values lookin' good or keepin' the peace, they ain't gonna embarrass themselves or their boss just to win a deal.  If they value a tough bargain, they ain't gonna give up easy.  So, before you sit down at the table, get a feel for those values. \n\nBut here's the thing:  gettin' to know the other guy personally can make a big difference too.  It's like, understand their values, but also, who they are.  That's how you make a real connection and get a good deal.",
            "Alright, lemme break this down for ya. So, these two brainiacs, St. Anselm and St. Thomas, both think God's the real deal. They're like, \"Yo, God exists!\" But they go about proving it in totally different ways. Anselm's all, \"Look inside yourself, dude! God's already there, man! You just gotta know it!\" He's sayin' that faith, like, knowing somethin' without proof, is the key. Kinda like trustin' your gut, ya know? \n\nThen there's Thomas, who's like, \"Nah, man, we need evidence! We gotta use our smarts!\"  He lays out five reasons why God's gotta be real, like pieces of a puzzle, ya dig?  He's all about logic and facts.\n\nNow, both these guys make some good points, but neither one, like, totally knocks it outta the park. \n\nIt's kinda like this: Anselm's sayin' faith is enough, but can you really trust somethin' you can't see or touch? And Thomas is like, \"Show me the proof!\" but where do you even start lookin' for proof of somethin' bigger than everything? It's a head-scratcher, man.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this dude, Buddha. He was born way back, like, way back in the day, like the 5th or 6th century BCE. This cat was a prince, but he went all zen and ditched the fancy life. He got super enlightened and started preachin', and his teachings became this thing called Buddhism. There's a bunch of different kinds of Buddhism, but the oldest one is called Theravada.  It's been around for like, 2500 years, and things have changed a bit since Buddha was around. Like in Sri Lanka, they got this water-cutting thing they do every year. Monks and regular folks do it, and it's kinda religious, even though Buddha never said nothin' about it.  It's like that, man, all kinds of stuff has changed, from the small stuff to the big stuff, the core stuff. The Theravada Buddhist peeps, both the monks and the regular folks, have had to tweak their beliefs over time. It's like, stuff happens, ya know? \n\nNow, listen up, 'cause we gotta talk about some special words. We're gonna use \"internal\" and \"external\" a lot. An internal force is somethin' that comes from inside the Buddhist crew, doesn't matter if you're a monk or not. An external force is anything from folks outside Buddhism. A hostile force is somethin' that wants to mess with Buddhism, like, hurt it or somethin'. A benign force is just chillin', not tryin' to help or hurt, but it might end up doin' one or the other by accident. We'll be usin' these words a lot, so pay attention.\n\nFirst things first, let's break down the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists find safety in the \"triple gem\"—Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha.  Dhamma is like the teachings, all written down in a bunch of books called the Tripitaka. You got the Sutta Pitaka, which is all the Buddha's sayings, the Vinaya Pitaka, which is like the rule book for monks, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which is all the deep, philosophical stuff. They talk about things like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (life is suffering), and Anicca (everything changes).  Gettin' all this stuff down is how you escape Sansara, which is like this endless cycle of bein' born and dying. Along with Sansara, you gotta get rid of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). Only then can you become enlightened.  The Vinaya Pitaka has rules for everyone, but the monks have a lot more. Regular folks gotta follow the five precepts: don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't be a jerk in love, and don't get wasted.  \n\nThe big idea in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, life is suffering (Dukkha). Second,  attaching to stuff causes suffering. Third, you can get rid of suffering. Fourth, there's a path to end suffering, which is called the Eightfold Path.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about these two countries, the U.S. and Mexico. They used to be at each other's throats, like, for a super long time, 57 years, from way back in 1836 to 1893. It was a real showdown, kinda like when Mack sends those goofy robot dudes after us. \n\nBack in 1846, things really kicked off with the Mexican-American War. The U.S. went and stomped all over Mexico, snagged Texas and the Southwest, and basically said, \"This is ours now!\" \n\nBut it wasn't just one big fight, ya know? There were a bunch of smaller skirmishes and arguments along the way. They couldn't see eye-to-eye on stuff like religion, culture, and who owned what. It's kinda like when Camo and Katt argue over who gets to use the TV remote.\n\nThis whole neighbor rivalry thing happens a lot, ya know? Countries that live near each other often butt heads over stuff. It's like when you have a sibling, you're always fighting over something, right? \n\nThe U.S. and Mexico were like that, except on a much bigger scale. This dude Pletcher said that Mexico and Cuba were the only countries that really gave the U.S. a hard time diplomatically, and I guess that makes sense because they're right next door. Other countries in Latin America? Not so much.\n\nReligion was a big deal too. Americans back then weren't too keen on Catholicism, kinda like how Sa2b freaks out when he sees a spider. It all went back to the old days, when the English and Spanish were constantly at odds.  \n\nThose 57 years had a ton of drama, like 17 different disputes!  Most of it was about border stuff, with bandits and outlaws causing trouble on both sides. It wasn't until both countries decided to crack down that things calmed down a bit.\n\n\nEventually, Mexico realized they needed the U.S. for stuff, and the U.S. shifted its focus from taking over land to, well, meddling in Mexico's economy. That's how the rivalry finally died down.",
            "Fifteen years back, bam! I got hit with a nasty illness outta nowhere.  Didn't even know it existed!  See, I was a nurse, always thought that was the safest bet. \"You'll always have a job, people gotta get sick, right?\" That's what everyone kept sayin'. So, even though I dreamed of being a scientist or a journalist, maybe both, I stuck with nursing.  \n\nBut here I was, 46, single, with nothin' saved up and no way to work. Still disabled fifteen years later, livin' on Social Security, and lemme tell ya, I've got nothin' to call my own anymore.  Every day's a struggle, a fight just to feel safe and good about myself.   nothin's for sure anymore, except for one thing: I wouldn't have made it without my family and a few real good friends. Believe me, when disaster hits, you don't feel so tough.\n\nLife throws curveballs, big and small, no matter how prepared you are.  Sometimes you need a hand. I get that we shouldn't rely on the government for everything, but wouldn't it be better if we learned to trust each other again? Help each other out, ask for help when we need it. Instead of building our own little bunkers, maybe we should be building each other up.\n\nThose conservatives talk about \"rugged individualism\" building this country, but it was compassion, respect, and sharing that got our ancestors through tough times. Those pioneers crossing the Rockies didn't do it alone, they relied on each other. \n\n\nSo, yeah, be prepared. I am. I got my emergency kit, first aid stuff, water tablets, and even plastic sheeting for a bio attack. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, canned goods, the whole shebang. If you got the space, grow your own food.  Get a wood stove, if you can.  \n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors. You never know when you might need 'em.",
            "Alright, so how come critters end up looking the way they do?  Is there some kinda rulebook for evolution, ya know?  Back in the day, this guy D'Arcy Thompson, way back in 1917,  said something like, \"Even today, scientists are just starting to figure out how to describe even the simplest creatures with math.\" And guess what? That's still kinda true!  But,  people are gettin' better at using math to figure out how shells grow,  like in those fancy clam things called mollusks.  We're trying to do the same thing with these cool snails called Prunum. We're using  math models and, like,  actual experiments to see how these snails change over time, and why they look the way they do.\n\nThink of a shell like a tube that's always on the move, spiraling around and around. Each twist is called a whorl, and it's all wrapped around this imaginary line called the columella, kinda like the center of the spiral. The size of each whorl can change, and the lines between them are called sutures. Usually, the biggest whorl is the last one, the one that's kind of like the \"belly\" of the snail.  All the other whorls make up the spire,  and the very tip is called the apex.\n\nYou can look at a shell in different ways, like from the top, the bottom, the opening, or even the opposite side of the opening.  \n\nTo count the whorls, you gotta look at it from the top, find the first suture, and draw a line. Then, count all the whorls from that line, even if they're just a little bit there.\n\nBasically, a shell is like a bunch of tiny doors opening up as the snail grows.  We can track these doors across space and time to see how the snail built its shell. We can even use math to figure out how the snail made its shell!  With enough math, we can change things up and see how the snail would look if it grew differently.",
            "Alright, so listen up!  Indonesia's doin' alright, ya know? They're crushin' it with the water and sanitation stuff, gettin' close to those Millennium Development Goals. But when it comes to takin' care of moms and babies, they're fallin' behind.  Like, way behind. It's like, \"Hey, we got clean water, but your kid's, like, dyin' from diarrhea.\"  Makes ya scratch your head, right?\n\nSee, they're sayin' more moms are havin' babies with those fancy \"skilled workers\" around. But here's the kicker: some of these \"skilled workers\" are just midwives, not doctors.  So, yeah, they're makin' progress, but not the kinda progress that saves lives.\n\nAnd they're not doin' so hot with kids either.  Fewer and fewer kiddos are gettin' help when they're sick, and postnatal care?  Forget about it!  It's practically non-existant.\n\nNow, here's the real doozy:  Cesarean sections are way down, like, only 4%. That's low, man, way too low. It's even worse in the country, only 2% compared to 7% in the city.  It's like they're forgettin' about the people who need it most. And the really messed up part? The poor folks, they're strugglin' to even get healthcare.  They're gettin' left behind.\n\nSo, what's the solution?  Should they build more programs or just fix the whole healthcare system? You gotta hand it to the programs, they're quick and easy.  But here's the downside: programs often suck the money and people away from other important stuff.  It's like, \"Hey, we got this HIV program, everyone go there!\"  While other stuff gets ignored.\n\nPlus, when you got a bunch of different programs runnin' around, it gets messy.  You got paperwork everywhere, supplies gettin' lost, and nobody knows what's goin' on.",
            "So, these Victorian books, they're all about fancy stuff and rich people, right?  But then you got these two books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" they're like, \"Nope, forget that!\" They're all about mysteries and weird stuff, which wasn't really a thing back then.  It makes the characters way more interesting, 'cause you get to see what's really going on in their heads.\n\nLike, take Oliver, he's got all these crazy dreams, like he's back with those mean guys, Sikes and Crackit, arguing and stuff. Then BAM!  Gunshots, chaos, lights flashing, he's being dragged away. It's all super confusing and scary, and you can tell Oliver's hurting, both physically and mentally.\n\n\nBoth of these books use dreams and crazy stuff to show us what's really going on inside the characters.  In \"Oliver Twist,\" Oliver's dreams are like windows into his soul, showing us what's bothering him and how he's feeling about everything that's happening. When he gets shot, he has this flashback, like a dream, where he relives the whole thing.  He's trapped, he can't control anything, and all he feels is pain. It's like the world is against him, and he's just a helpless pawn.  It makes you wonder, who's really in charge of his life?  And it makes you feel sorry for him, 'cause he's just a kid trying to survive in a cruel world. \n\n \"Wuthering Heights\" does the dream thing too, but it's a bit more...intense.  It's all about secrets and hidden feelings, and the dreams are like these creepy little glimpses into the characters' dark side.",
            "A couple years back, I was workin' at this after-school program, you know, helpin' out those little elementary kids with their schoolwork. I was pretty good at English and readin', so that's mostly what I stuck to. One day, I got roped into helpin' this little dude named Adrian, I think he was in third or fourth grade, couldn't read worth a lick. Now, this kid, he speaks perfect English,  but somethin' just wasn't right. He'd nail some letters, then completely butcher others, super weird, ya know? I figured he was Latino, but maybe his English was new to him.  We struggled for ages, until one day, Adrian's mom showed up.  Now, she didn't speak a lick of English, just Spanish.  I was tryin' to piece together what she was sayin' with my super rusty Spanish (I was just learnin' back then).  Then it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read fine, he just wasn't familiar with the English alphabet!  I don't know if it made a difference in the long run, but I hope that fella's doin' alright.\n\nSee, that story's why I gotta talk about this whole language barrier thing in schools, especially here in California. It ain't always as obvious as it seems. Even if a kid speaks perfect English, readin' it can still be a major pain.  Everybody knows this problem exists, so what's the deal? For Adrian, it was simple:  tutorin' on English readin', focusin' on the alphabet and sounds. But for kids who barely speak English, it's a whole other ball game. There ain't just one answer, ya know? Dual language programs, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes... none of 'em work miracles on their own. You gotta mix and match!\n\n\nFirst off, dual language programs are a great idea, not just for Spanish speakers, but for everybody! Studies show kids in these programs do better in school.  Some folks get all scared and say it wastes resources and most kids won't benefit.  But that's hogwash! If we made these programs the norm instead of the exception, everyone would be better off. But how do we do it? Make every teacher bilingual?  Nah, that's crazy talk. But we could definitely have bilingual helpers, tutors, you get the idea.",
            "Ok, so picture this: everyone's always talkin' about somethin' big out there, somethin' way bigger than us. Like, duh, right? Some folks go to church, others hit up the temple, some even try to figure it all out on their own. A lot of us just go with what our folks taught us, ya know? But then there are those who say \"Nope, ain't nothin' out there but me!\" They think the world revolves around 'em. Kinda selfish, if you ask me.  Anyway, we all find our own way, tryin' to figure out what makes us tick, what gives our lives meaning. We're lookin' for that spark, somethin' to guide us outta the darkness and into the sunshine.\n\nMy old man, he loved cardinals.  We were sittin' on the porch one day, rain comin' down like crazy, poundin' on the roof. It was like the whole world was drownin'.  He was lookin' out at the rain, all lost in thought. He'd gotten real skinny and his clothes were hangin' off him like he'd shrunk. His hair was thinner too, like the wind had blown it all away. He wouldn't look at me, just stared out at the storm. I felt kinda lost, scared, like I couldn't talk to him about how much I was gonna miss him 'cause sayin' it out loud would make it real. So I just hugged him, moved my chair closer, and we sat there together, watchin' the rain.\n\nHe died that December, five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation didn't really help, just kept him hangin' on longer than the doctors thought.  I couldn't figure out what good that did, y'know? Seemed like a kinda cruel thing for God to do, if He even existed. I didn't pray that night. If God was really listenin', He'd stopped a long time ago.\n\nI didn't wanna see him go, so I didn't. Couldn't stand watchin' the man who made me slip away.  I wanted to remember him how he was, not how he died.  Besides, I knew my dad better than anyone else did, even his own family. I knew he wouldn't want me there, watchin' him fade away. I just curled up in bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\nNo one even called.",
            "Alright, so, get this – the whole \"Gothic Novel\" thing is kinda like a crazy mix-up, right? It's old stuff, but it's also brand new! This guy, Ian Watt, he says it's like an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" which basically means it's a total head-scratcher. People have been talking smack about it, praising it to the heavens, saying it's shallow, then praising its spooky awesomeness.  \n\nSee, this dude Horace Walpole, he wrote the first real Gothic Novel, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" and he mixed up old-school plays with all this nature stuff that was super trendy back then. He called it a \"Gothic Story,\" and BAM! He started a whole new way of writing. \n\nGothic stuff is all about bringing back the spooky vibes of old castles, plays, and legends. When Walpole wrote his thing, people already used \"Gothic\" for all sorts of stuff, like talking about ancient people or whatever. It was like saying something was old-fashioned and not cool compared to the \"modern\" stuff everyone was into.\n\nBut here's the kicker – Gothic novels kinda became a big deal because they had these old-school spooky vibes, but they also let you get into the heads of the characters, which was new and exciting. It's like they're both super old and totally fresh at the same time!\n\nOne of the big ideas in Gothic novels is this whole \"Chivalry\" thing. Think knights in shining armor, brave and honorable, you know? Gothic writers loved talking about chivalry because it was like a reminder of how things used to be, and they thought people weren't as knightly anymore.  \n\nWalpole, he was writing during a time when things were super messed up politically, and he was worried about the future. Maybe he thought the good ol' days were better, back when knights were around. In his story, you see this knightly character named Frederic, who's described as the perfect knight, almost too perfect. He's a prince, he's sad because of some tragedy, and he's supposed to be dead.",
            "Okay, so picture this: you order somethin' online, right?  Like, a new pair of shoes or somethin'.  That order kicks off this crazy chain reaction, like a domino effect, but with stuff instead of dominoes. That's what we call \"Supply Chain Management\", and it's how stuff gets from the raw materials to your doorstep faster than you can say \"Amazon Prime!\"\n\nThis dude named Keith Oliver, back in 1982, came up with the term. He was all about gettin' stuff to customers quick and easy, like a ninja of logistics.\n\nHere's the lowdown: there are six main parts to this whole supply chain thing. We got: \n\n* **Production:** This is where the magic happens!  It's like buildin' a spaceship, but instead of rockets, we're talkin' products. Managers gotta figure out what folks want, how much they want, and where to build it all. Kinda like a super-organized puzzle. \n* **Supply:** Now we gotta get the ingredients for our spaceship, right? That's where supply comes in.  Managers gotta decide who's gonna make what, and if we should team up with other companies. Outsourcing, they call it. It's like gettin' your buddy to help you build your spaceship. \n* **Inventory:** Gotta keep track of all those shiny parts, right?  That's inventory.  Too much, and it takes up space; too little, and we're outta luck. Managers gotta find that sweet spot. \n* **Location:** Where do we build this spaceship, anyway?  Managers gotta pick the best spot for production, thinkin' about stuff like shipping costs and how close it is to customers. \n* **Transportation:** How do we get our spaceship from the factory to the customer? Trucks, trains, planes, maybe even a magic carpet?  Managers gotta figure out the best way to move stuff around. \n* **Information:** This is the brains of the operation.  Managers need to know everything about the whole process, from how much stuff we have to where it's going. Think of it like a giant, interconnected web of data.\n\nIt's a lot to keep track of, but if everything's run smoothly, we get our shiny new spaceship – er, I mean product – delivered right to our door!",
            "Alright, so there's this chick, Ellen, you know, the one from that Juno movie?  She's standing on a street corner, holding up this cardboard sign with some crazy stuff written on it.  It says, \"Hitler is alive in Burma!\"  Now, Burma, that's like this place in Southeast Asia, right?  It's run by these super mean guys who kinda took over back in '62, like a total power grab.  A few years back, these monks, all dressed in saffron robes, started protesting.  They called it the \"Saffron Revolution,\" get it? Anyway, things got really heated, the government wasn't happy, and they started messing with the monks.  Journalists got thrown in jail, one guy even got killed just for taking pictures! It's like, totally messed up.\n\nThis isn't a new thing, though.  It's like, governments have always wanted to control everything, right?  Like back in Rome, the emperors acted like they were gods, bossing everyone around.  And don't even get me started on Japan, they think their emperors are, like, actual gods!  And here in America, our president, well, let's just say he talks to some interesting people.\n\nThen there's stuff like what happened in Tiananmen Square back in '89.  A bunch of students and intellectuals just wanted to speak up, but the government got all violent.  They say only a couple hundred people died, but others say it was thousands! And then there's the Rwandan genocide, where people were killed just because of who they were.  And of course, you can't forget Hitler and the Nazis.  They were all about killing anyone they didn't like.\n\nIt's just, like, sad and scary, you know?",
            "So, check it out, this dude Duke Ellington, right? He's a big deal in the jazz world. He stuck around for ages, which means he got super good at making his band sound awesome.  You know, he doesn't always play piano super loud in his songs, but as a composer, he was a total genius. He wrote these crazy complex tunes that let each musician shine. He'd build a framework where soloists could go wild, but also make these tight, organized sections that showed off each player's style.  He knew how to make the whole band sound like one big, awesome machine.\n\nThis one dictionary, The Grove Music Dictionary, says Ellington was always using his singers like instruments.  They talk about a song called \"Creole Love Call\" where he does this thing where the singer just makes sounds, like a totally new kind of instrument. It's like, forget the words, it's all about the feeling.  And he was always making sure the singers and the instruments worked together perfectly, which is pretty cool.\n\n\"Creole Love Call\" is this slow, bluesy song with six parts, each one different.\n\n* **Part 1:**  The singer and the wind instruments go back and forth, like a conversation. The singer starts smooth, then gets kinda rougher at the end.\n* **Part 2:**  A trumpet player comes in with a muted trumpet – think of it like a cool echo of the tune.  He plays some really long notes, adding this bluesy flavor.\n* **Part 3:**  The clarinet player takes over, playing high and fast. The piano adds these little, off-beat notes that make it all swing.\n* **Part 4:**  The whole band jumps in, echoing the first part with the brass and wind instruments trading lines.\n* **Part 5:**  This is the big one! The wind instruments start singing back and forth in their highest range, and the brass and drums play a crazy fast beat, like it’s about to explode!\n* **Part 6:**  Back to the beginning, but the singer is sounding rougher now, almost like they're growling, making their voice sound like an instrument.\n* **The end:** A quick little finish with the singer running up and down the scale, and then, BOOM! A trombone plays a weird note that just hangs in the air.\n\n Ellington was always finding new ways to use his singers, adding this extra color to his music.\n\nIn another song called \"Hot and Bothered,\" he does this cool thing with a trumpet player and a singer. They take turns playing and singing, and their voices and instruments blend together like they were meant to be. And then in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\"  he uses this trombone player named Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton to start the song. It's like he knew exactly how to make each musician sound their best.",
            "This girl, man, she was always chasing after somethin'. It started when she hit her teens, like, at 14.  This need, this emptiness, it just wouldn't quit. By the time she hit 17, she figured out she wanted someone, not some shiny thing. But boys? Pfft.  They tried, those goofy dudes, all awkward smiles and fumbled attempts to win her over. But nothin' worked. She just wasn't feelin' it. It was like a mystery, this whole \"un-woo-able\" thing. She wracked her brain, tried to figure it out, but nothin' stuck. So she just kept on livin', always wonderin' about this hole inside her. \n\nLife at home was usually chill. Her parents were cool, laid-back folks. They never fought, and arguments with their daughter were, like, super rare. The only time things got heated was when she tried to spread her wings and be her own person.  She was the chill kid of super chill parents, but she brought the energy, you know?  Her personality was big time, and people loved her for it. \n\nBut today, things were off. She was wanderin' around the house, lookin' for some spark of inspiration, when BAM! A scream ripped through the air, her mom's voice, all panicked. She bolted into the kitchen, heart pounding, \"Mom! What's wrong?!\" Her mom was sprawled on the floor, lookin' all messed up, whimpering \"Ow\" between breaths. The daughter rushed to her side, \"Mom, tell me what happened!\"\n\nHer mom, voice shaky, managed, \"Sweetheart... I need you to take me to... the hospital.\" She was in bad shape, her daughter could tell.  \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\"  Her mom gestured weakly, and the daughter, thankful she'd taken those self-defense classes, scooped her up and carried her to the car. \n\nThe hospital was a whirlwind of smells: disinfectant, sickness, and fear.  But she was too focused on her mom to feel it. She rushed her inside, screaming for help. Doctors swarmed around, whisked her mom away on a gurney.  Her daughter, left alone, sat in a chair, worry gnawing at her. Turns out, her mom had tried to grab a vase from a high shelf and tumbled off a step stool.",
            "Alright, so picture this: there's this super healthy way of eating called the \"Mediterranean Diet,\" or Med diet for short.  It's all about lots of fruits, veggies, nuts, whole grains, and fish, with less meat and fat.  Think of it like a giant salad bar with a side of delicious fish!\n\nWell, some brainiacs wanted to see if this Med diet could actually keep your ticker in tip-top shape and prevent heart problems.  They called it the \"aMed diet\" and even made a special score to see how well people followed it. Turns out, folks who ate like they were on a Mediterranean vacation had WAY less heart attacks and strokes.\n\nThis wasn't just some random guess, though. A bunch of smart nurses filled out questionnaires about what they ate for like, twenty years straight.  They even checked their medical records to make sure everything was on the up and up. And guess what? The nurses who ate the most Med-style grub were way less likely to have a heart attack or stroke.\n\nSo, basically, if you wanna live a long, healthy life, maybe start loading up on that Mediterranean goodness!",
            "Back in 2007, America went through a rough patch, like, super rough. People lost their jobs left and right, houses were worth nothin', and even big companies went belly up. This whole mess, it's still kinda hangin' around today. So, what went wrong? Well, let's just say some folks in charge made some bad calls, ya know? They pushed banks and companies to give out loans to folks who weren't exactly the best at paying 'em back. Meanwhile, these two big fellas, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, kept buyin' up these bad loans and stuffin' 'em into these fancy packages. Like, they thought they could sell 'em off like hotcakes. But when people couldn't pay, BAM! The whole thing came crashin' down.\n\nSee, this whole thing started way back in '99 when President Clinton was tryin' to get re-elected. He wanted to look good, ya know? So, he loosened up the rules about loans, which kinda set the stage for this whole mess seven years down the line. One guy, Steven Holmes from the New York Times, he was like, \"Whoa, this ain't gonna end well.\" He saw what was comin', but nobody listened.\n\nSo, now we had these newfangled mortgages, like the ones with interest rates that changed all the time. Plus, these crazy things called mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations. It's like they were tryin' to make everything more complicated than it needed to be. Everyone got so mixed up in the housing market, they forgot to watch their own wallets.\n\nThen, boom! The bubble burst. All those banks and companies that had bought up those fancy mortgage packages were in big trouble. They were drownin' in debt, and the big players, like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, went down in flames.  Fannie and Freddie, those two mortgage giants, they were in trouble too. They were so deep in debt, the government had to step in and take over. \n\nIt was a real mess, man.",
            "Alright, let's talk about exposition. That part of your story where you're supposed to dazzle readers with your fancy writing, you know, the part where everyone's hanging on your every word or... they're hitting that \"Back\" button and muttering curses under their breath. Dr. Merlin, a writing guru I know, she gets pretty riled up when she encounters too much exposition. It's like watching paint dry, only less exciting.\n\nYou writers out there, you already know the golden rule: \"Show, don't tell.\" But even the best of us sometimes fall into the trap of info-dumps, paragraphs and paragraphs of nothing happening, or worse, way too much happening all at once. Exposition is like that little voice in your ear whispering, \"Get the backstory out of the way so you can get to the juicy parts!\"  It's that same voice that makes you want to tell the reader every single detail about every character's childhood.\n\nExposition is basically just telling your audience what happened, usually in a plain and boring way. Think of those long, winded explanations in movies where one character lays out a whole history lesson to another. In writing, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nHere's an example. Imagine you're reading a story where the heroine meets her true love, they have a fancy wedding, and then, bam! He's murdered right in front of her. Would you want to read two whole pages about this, with only a couple of lines of dialogue from each character? Probably not. You'd want the author to spend some time developing the husband's character. Make him come alive through his words, his actions, showing how deeply he loves his wife. You'd want to see how her life changed and improved because of him, in big and small ways.\n\nA good introduction to the husband would make you care about what happens to him, and it would give you a better understanding of the heroine. You'd mourn his death with her, and that would make you feel more connected to her.\n\nBasically, you want to give your readers something more than just the bare bones of the story. You want to give them the juicy stuff, the details that make the story come alive.\n\nSometimes it's tempting to rush past important details. You might have a new character who used to be in the Air Force, now he's a gas station night manager, he's been married twice, no kids, loves fishing, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast. Give us the details!",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about these news stories I saw from Columbus, Ohio. See, I was watchin' NBC 4 this mornin', August 13th, and this dude named Shad Hostettler, looked like a real scumbag, ya know? Stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. They didn't even say her name, but they showed his mugshot, and boy, did he look evil! They only talked about it for a couple minutes 'cause it was still happening, but they said he stabbed her a bunch of times and got arrested.\n\nThen they talked about some kid named Travis Buyers, 18, got shot up in Sharon Woods early that mornin'. Critically injured, they said, but no arrests yet. SWAT team's on the case. Seemed like they rushed through that one, though. Maybe 'cause he was a black kid, ya know? I've noticed that before, always seems like the media goes crazy over white folks, but black folks, well, it's like they don't even exist sometimes.\n\nNext up, some genius shot a hole in a Med-Flight chopper with a .22 rifle. They were talkin' about where it happened and stuff. Crime Stoppers offered five grand for any tips leading to the shooter. \n\nThen they threw in some weather stuff - rain and thunderstorms comin' Saturday. Short and sweet, like they wanted ya to keep watchin'.\n\nFollowed that with a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. Some dude, supposedly black, wearing a hoodie, about six feet tall and 150 pounds, robbed the place. They kept sayin' he was black and how dark his skin was, seemed kinda weird to me.\n\nFinally, they talked about this Rene Rodriguez, some big-shot drug dealer from Texas. Convicted of sendin' weed to Ohio. Instead of sayin' 25 years, they said \"300 months\". Like that made it sound worse or somethin'. And they kept sayin' he was Hispanic, not sure why that mattered.",
            "Brothers, man, they're somethin' else.  Like, there's this crazy bond between 'em, ya know? It's like, unbreakable, like a freakin' steel cable.  But it's more than just good stuff, like love and all that.  There's jealousy, anger, even that messed-up stuff like cruelty, thrown in there too.  \n\nBrothers, they get each other like nobody else.  It's like lookin' in a mirror, seein' yourself straight up.  But when things get really rough, that's when this bond, it really shows its true colors.  And let me tell ya, sometimes those colors can be pretty darn ugly. \n\nSee, understandin' what brothers feel, it ain't easy.  It's like a rollercoaster of emotions, and the consequences, well, they can be a real pain in the neck.\n\nYou see it all the time, these brothers, starin' each other dead in the eyes, seein' their own reflection.  Not how others see 'em, but the real deal, the good, the bad, the whole shebang.  And in their actions, in the stuff they do and the stuff that happens because of it, that's where you see their true colors, their real character. \n\nThis story, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" it's all about that.  These two brothers, they're like two sides of the same coin, full of all these crazy emotions, tossin' 'em around like it's nothin'.  They go on this wild ride, this journey, and it's a real tearjerker. \n\nOne brother, he's got this big ol' pride thing goin' on.  He wants a brother who can keep up, who can do all the cool stuff, you know? But his little brother, Doodle, he's different. He can't keep up, he's always slowin' him down. And the older brother, well, he starts gettin' all resentful, even angry.",
            "Man, my brain is like this crazy computer, but way cooler! Back in the day, people thought it was like a wax thing or a scroll, but now we know better. It's more like a super-powered machine that takes in all kinds of stuff from the world around us, like sounds, smells, and stuff you can touch. \n\nIt's all about how your brain takes these signals and makes sense of them. It's like a team effort, with different parts working together. First, it breaks things down into tiny bits, like figuring out what colors are where and what shapes are what. Then, it uses what it already knows to help figure things out faster. Like, if you see a black box on a white background, your brain already knows what a box looks like, so it can zoom right in and say, \"Hey, that's a box!\"\n\nBut hold on, there's more! Your brain's also got this super-focus thing called attention. It's like a spotlight that shines on the most important stuff. So, you might be looking at your shoes, but your brain's mostly ignoring all the tiny blades of grass. But if someone says your name, BAM! Your brain's all over it.\n\nAnd get this, your brain stores all this information! It's got different memory places, like a short-term memory for things you're thinking about right now and a long-term memory for everything else. It's how you remember your best friend's birthday or how to ride a bike.\n\nScientists are still trying to figure out exactly how all this works, but they have some pretty cool ideas. One idea is that your brain is like a giant network of connections, with each connection representing a thought or idea.",
            "Okay, so picture this: there's this book called \"Brave New World\" by this dude Huxley, right? He's basically saying that all this fancy technology and the whole \"gotta keep buying stuff\" thing is gonna mess us up big time. See, in this world, folks are all about being part of the group and getting their instant happiness fix. They're practically brainwashed from the get-go to chase after pleasure and forget about being themselves. It's like they're all playing a game, but they don't even know they're pawns!  \n\nThis Huxley dude, he's got this angle that kinda sounds like Marxism. You know, the whole idea that things ain't always fair and that the rich folks are using us for their own gain?  Huxley throws around words like \"homogeny\" and \"reification,\" which basically mean everyone's the same and stuff gets turned into just a thing to be bought and sold. It's like he's saying the whole system is rigged against the little guy.\n\nHe's also got this sharp point about how people in \"Brave New World\" are tricked into thinking they're happy even though they're not. They're so focused on getting the latest gadget or having the coolest clothes that they don't even see the bigger picture. It's like they're wearing a pair of rose-colored glasses, but those glasses are blinding them to the truth.\n\nAnd get this, the way those upper-class folks just go along with everything, even though they know it's messed up, that's kinda like what Marx talked about too! He called it \"hegemony,\" basically one group of people controlling everything while the rest just go along with it.\n\nThen there's this whole thing about relationships. Or, rather, the lack of them.  Everyone's so busy chasing after their own pleasure that they don't have time for real connections. It's all surface level, like they're just going through the motions.\n\nHuxley might be saying that technology and capitalism are sucking the soul out of humanity. No time for love, no time for deep thoughts, just endless consumerism and shallow interactions. It's kinda scary, you know?",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this college campus, man. I've been here for a couple years now, and let me tell ya, getting around this place is a real pain in the butt.  My freshman year, I lived way out east, practically on the edge of the world.  Getting to classes in some random building like Willard, which is, like, in the middle of everything, took forever. \n\nAbout 25 minutes, walking, especially if the weather was being a total jerk, which, let's be real, happens all the time here in State College. I heard from one of my buddies who just graduated that back in the day, there was, like, tons of empty space between the East Halls dorms and the rest of campus. Now, they've built a bunch of new stuff: sports fields, fancy buildings like the Creamery and a new health center, even apartments. \n\nAs the campus keeps growing, it's getting harder and harder to get from point A to point B. What's the best way to solve this mess? Bikes, baby! But it's not just about having bikes, the whole campus needs to be built for bikers. I was talking to this dude the other day who got back into biking after a long break, and he said, \"Bikes are awesome! It's the only way to get around.\"\n\nBesides being good for you, biking is the fastest and most efficient way to travel. You can easily cruise 30 miles on a bowl of oatmeal and some pedaling.  I live off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms.  The best decision I made this year was buying a bike. My classes are in Thomas building, which is, like, a 25-minute walk from my place. But on my bike? Bam! 5 minutes flat if I really push it! \n\nThe only problem is, Pollock Road is the fastest way to get there, but it ain't always the safest for biking.  Walking is cool too, but I'm too busy for that. If I didn't have my bike, I'd be stuck walking everywhere.  Walking to Thomas every day would be an extra 30-40 minutes each way, that's over two and a half hours a week!  And that's just for one class! Add on all the other stuff, and that's way too much time wasted."
