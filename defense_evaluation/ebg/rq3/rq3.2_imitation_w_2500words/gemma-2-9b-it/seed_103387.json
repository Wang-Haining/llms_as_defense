            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

I wanna work with the Division of Family and Children Services, ya know, be a real hero for those little guys. And hey, I wanna help out families too, get 'em back on track and all that. \n\nI'm all about those core values, the good stuff: helping out, treating everyone with respect, being honest and ethical, and always working to make things better. Not just for other people, but for myself too. Gotta keep learning and growing, right?\n\nSee, I've always wanted to make a difference, but I wasn't sure how. In school, I saw a lot of people trying to escape their problems, some even using pretty messed-up ways to cope. It made me realize that I wanted to do something about it.\n\nSo I went for a Psychology degree, figured it would give me some tools. But after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, ya know, just to chill. One day, a friend introduced me to this kid, just sixteen, sitting like a scared puppy on her couch. Turns out, he was escaping his abusive parents.\n\nThe next day, I heard he called the cops! So I hopped over to his parents' place, just to see if I could help. I told the cops about my degree and my concerns. They asked me to talk to the parents, 'cause there wasn't much they could do.\n\nMan, those parents were shifty! They were nervous and blaming the kid for everything, calling him \"manipulative\" for reaching out for help. That's when I knew, I had to do something. I gotta help these kids, even if it's just to give them a voice. Social work, that's where I gotta be.\n\nAnd hey, it's not just about helping kids, it's about social justice too.  We talk about how important individuals are, but then we expect everyone to be the same.  I'm an individual, and I don't like being boxed in.\n\nThroughout high school and college, I fought for what's right: dyed my hair crazy colors, wore what I wanted, pierced my ears, joined that GSBA thing (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and stood up against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it.  \n\nI'm all about social justice, man.

            "Alright, so check this out!  We're gonna dive into the whole sleep thing, especially this thing called insomnia. There are these two main ways people look at why it happens – the \"it's all in your genes and your body\" way, and the \"it's all about your surroundings and who you hang with\" way. We're gonna check out some studies that back up each idea and see if they hold water.  \n\nSo, basically, sleep problems come in all shapes and sizes. You got your primary sleep messes, like insomnia (can't fall asleep!) or hypersomnia (can't stay awake!).  Then there are sleep problems caused by other mental stuff or even medical conditions.  And don't forget the wild ones - sleepwalking, nightmares, the whole shebang!\n\nWe're gonna focus on insomnia here, and how the \"it's in your genes\" crew and the \"it's all about your life\" crew explain it.\n\nThe \"it's in your genes\" people talk about how your brain is wired for sleep. There are these tiny parts in your brain called neurons that control when you're sleepy and when you're not. They're like little switches that flip back and forth. Scientists did an experiment with mice and found that these neurons have special receptors that can be turned on or off, and when they're turned off, it makes the mice sleepy! \n\nThis means that maybe, just maybe, some people are born with these receptors that don't work quite right, making it harder for them to fall asleep.  If that's the case, it's kinda like a built-in sleep problem. \n\nAnd the \"it's your life, man\" people say that your environment and experiences play a big role too. Where you live, who you hang out with, even your job – all that stuff can mess with your sleep.\n\nSo, who's right? Probably both!

They might also have a hard time followin' instructions or understandin' what people are sayin' when there's lots of background noise.\n\nNow, imagine you're a teacher and one of your students has CAPD. Don't worry, there are things you can do to help 'em out!  Make sure they sit near the front of the classroom, minimize distractions, and break down instructions into smaller, simpler steps.

Maybe Shakespeare is just messing with us, showing how people can be shallow and judge based on looks.  It's kinda funny, but also kinda messed up.\n\nThe whole thing makes you think about how pretending can bring out hidden feelings.

            "Alright, lemme tell ya 'bout this whole German invasion thing, 'cause it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Ya see, they were pretty rough on the folks in South West Africa (that's Namibia now), especially the Ovaherero and Nama people.  They, like, wiped 'em out!  Not cool, right?  \n\nNow, I ain't sayin' all the Germans were bad.  They had different ways of doin' things in different places, kinda like how my buddy Camo does things his own way.  Sometimes they even did good stuff, like teachin' folks in places like East Africa (Tanganyika).  When those Brits showed up in 1919, they were surprised to see so many smart Africans who knew how to read and write!  Even in Kamerun, they got praise for their schools.\n\nBut in South West Africa, it was a whole 'nother story.  No fancy state schools for the locals there.  It was all up to these missionary folks, who didn't get much help from the government.  They did spend a lot of dough on schools for the Europeans though, which ain't right!  This messed things up for a long time, even after the Germans packed up and left.  While other places had lots of educated Africans, South West Africa was left behind.\n\nSo why the difference?  Well, there's a bunch of reasons, and folks are still tryin' to figure it all out.  It's got to do with how the settlers felt about the local folks, and what the government wanted.  There are tons of books about this stuff, mostly written by Germans back in the day.  They mostly just described the schools, but some folks have been diggin' deeper, comparing different colonies and lookin' at what made them tick.  One guy named Cohen did a good job lookin' at South West Africa and East Africa, and he thinks the big settler population in South West Africa had a lot to do with the different education system.  He's probably right, 'cause South West Africa was pretty nice for Europeans compared to other places.  They had good weather and lots of room to spread out.  More folks wanted to move there, which changed everything.",
            "Man, trying to figure out what all the different kinds of music are these days, it's like trying to herd cats! I mean, you got your rock, your rap, your country, your jazz, your folk, and then each of those has like a million different flavours, right?  It's crazy! But outta all those styles, heavy metal, that's the one that's really exploded.  It's been around for about 40 years and it's gotten so big and wild, it's hard to even describe what it is anymore.\n\nSee, heavy metal is all about going big, ya know? It's got more energy, more noise, more attitude than most music. It's like they crank up the volume to eleven and just let loose. And these guys, they can really play their instruments!  It's not just loud, it's actually good. \n\nBut heavy metal is more than just noise.  It's got this dark side too, like it taps into some deep stuff.  Back when it first started, people were experimenting with drugs, like those crazy psychedelic ones. And that got mixed up with the music, making it sound weirder and wilder. \n\nHeavy metal is also like a big family, with lots of different branches. It's like a tree that keeps growing new branches and leaves.  It's borrowed stuff from other kinds of music too,  but it always stays true to its roots. To really understand heavy metal, you gotta see it as a whole movement, not just a bunch of songs.  It's a way of expressing yourself, a way of being loud and proud and not afraid to be different. And that's what makes it so cool.",
            "So, picture this: way before those wacky Surrealists were messing with our minds with their crazy paintings, there was this painter named Henri Rousseau, and he was busy crafting his own kinda dream world, both in his head and on his canvases. This painting, \"The Dream\" – it's from 1910, and man, talk about a mind-bender! This lady's totally blown away by the wild stuff she sees in her dream, right? But get this, it's not just about the dream, it's about Rousseau himself, his hopes and dreams as an artist.  See, this guy really wanted to be recognized, to have other artists and art fans all shout his praises. But here's the catch: he was stuck in this awkward spot – should he play it safe and copy the way everyone else was painting to get those fancy art world folks on his side, or should he just go his own way, paint his own crazy vision, even if it meant no one understood? \"The Dream,\" man, that painting is like his big question mark about that whole thing, his inner battle. \n\nYou gotta know a bit about Rousseau's story to get the full picture. He was born way back in 1844, in France. His dad was a pretty well-off hardware guy, but Rousseau never got any fancy art training. He actually worked for the government for years, dealing with tolls and stuff. He lost his first wife and most of his kids, which was a real blow. So, he decided to paint – it was like his escape hatch, a way to start fresh. And get this, unlike some other artists who painted romanticized versions of peasants, Rousseau was a regular guy, painting about the stuff that mattered to regular people.  \n\nRousseau really wanted to be accepted by the art world, and honestly, you can kinda see why. He was older when he started painting, didn't have any fancy education, and he was competing with all these other talented artists who were already famous. It was like trying to break into a club when everyone else already had VIP passes!  Some folks even say that Rousseau wanted his paintings to be so \"normal\" that people would think he was a real \"official\" artist, while Matisse was all about being unique and terrifying the art world with his wild stuff.",
            "A lotta brainy folks think beauty and right and wrong are, like, totally connected. Like, truth AND beauty, you know?  John Keats kinda said it best, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty – That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn a lot from books and stuff, but beauty and right and wrong, they kinda just hit you, ya know?  It's like we get 'em without someone teachin' us. Both beauty and  doing the right thing, they're more about explainin' why something's good or beautiful, rather than makin' rules about how to make it.\n\nThink about it. You can talk all day about why the Mona Lisa is awesome,  mentionin' foregrounds and shadows and stuff, but that don't really say WHY it's so cool. When someone asks about their favorite book or painting, they're gonna say something like, \"There's just something about it,\" before they even start talkin' 'bout the fancy stuff.\n\nArt and morals, they can't be fully explained, ya know? Like Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\"  Even if you describe a book perfectly, there's still somethin' extra, somethin' special, that you can't quite put your finger on.  And that's kinda how it is with morals too.  \n\nI think that's why art and morals are so close. We feel 'em deep down, in a way that's hard to explain.  And with books, it's even stronger. Literature makes us think about what's right and wrong, just like life does. We care about books 'cause they show us those values.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya 'bout Germany, see? This place is somethin' else!  It's strong, it's united, and it's got this crazy cool mix of culture, from the Alps in München all the way to the Baltic Sea in Kiel.  You go from Köln by the Rhine to Dresden on the Elbe, and you just KNOW this place is special.  It's got a history, you know what I mean?  A bunch of different tribes and stuff, all mixin' together to make what Germany is today.\n\nNow, they call this land \"Germania,\" which is kinda a mystery.  Some bloke named Tacitus, way back when, said it came from a tribe called the Tungrians.  They were tough guys, battled the Gauls, crossed the Rhine and all that.  Then there's Julius Caesar, famous for his Roman stuff, who used the word \"Germanus\" to talk 'bout these tribes he was fightin'.  He got it from the Gauls themselves, I guess, to tell 'em apart.  Some think it came from the spear they used, a \"ger,\" or maybe even from an old word for \"shoutin',\" 'cause those Germans were loud!\n\nThis other Roman guy, Tacitus, wrote a whole book about the Germans, sayin' they were the real deal, nothin' mixed in.  He even said, \"Who would leave Asia, Africa, or even Italy for Germany?  It's wild, the weather's bad, the people are grumpy!\"  Guess not many Romans were headin' there. They'd swing by for some goods or a little fight, but mostly they stayed in Rome.  Meanwhile, the Germanic tribes were livin' on the edges of the Roman Empire, sellin' stuff and even joinin' the Roman army.\n\nSo, that's Germany in a nutshell.  A mix of cultures, a history full of stories, and a bunch of tough people who built somethin' special.",
            "Alright, check this out. I'm lookin' at this mess, right? And my brain, it's just... blank. Like, I'm seein' it all, but I ain't really *thinkin* about it. Just like, processin' it, y'know?  Thoughts pop in and outta my head faster than a jackrabbit on a sugar rush.  It's like my mind's on autopilot, just observin', no big deal.\n\nFunny thing is, this reminds me of this art book I got, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  Always wanted to draw, ever since I was a kid.  This book, it breaks down how your brain sees stuff, how to turn a whole kitchen scene, with a bowl of fruit and all that jazz, into just that bowl of fruit, like a simple picture.\n\nBut right now, I can't do that. I'm too blown away! Picasso had his blue phase, Monet went crazy for greens, the Renaissance guys, they loved their rainbows.  If I'm gonna call myself an artist, well, this is my start, my story, my \"Work in Brown,\" get it?\n\nSo, I'm grabbin' my tool, my hand's twitchin', ready to create. Water's swirl  in' peaceful like, clean and clear. Tiny bits break off and float away.  Then my hand jerks, kinda panicky, like I'm scared of missin' somethin'. I slam the toilet handle again.  Nope. Stuck like glue.\n\nI'm standin' there, tie feelin' like a strangler, mop lookin' kinda pathetic in my hand. I gotta stare at this brown mess someone left, like it's a message for the bathroom cleaners.  Flush, think, flush.  Then I grab the toilet paper, wrap it around my hand like a giant oven mitt.  Bend down, my hand goes in the bowl, slow and steady, like I'm gettin' ready to grab a turkey for Thanksgiving.",
            "Yo, check it! Teenagers are like, totally dying behind the wheel, you know? It's a major bummer.  See, the thing is, their brains ain't fully cooked yet, like, they're still developing.  And they're not exactly experienced behind the wheel either. That's a recipe for disaster, man! They're crashing, rolling over, speeding, and driving off the road like it's nothin'.\n\nPlus, they always gotta have their friends in the car, you know how it is.  It's like they can't even drive without a party bus full of buddies.  These scientists did a study and found that the more young passengers, the more accidents.\n\nSo, some states are trying to keep things a little safer with these \"provisional licenses.\"  You know, those things that limit the hours you can drive and who can ride with you.  But, like, that's just a band-aid, man. The real problem is that teens just aren't ready for the heavy stuff.\n\nThis psychologist dude, Marvin Zuckerman, says even 18 is too young to get a license.  He says young people are all about that thrill, you know, pushing the limits just for the rush.  Maybe we should chill on the driving thing until they're a little older, when they've calmed down a bit.\n\nThink about it:  by 2010, a whole bunch of baby boomers' kids will be hitting the road.  We're gonna have a major teen driver explosion, and it's gonna be a mess if we don't do something.\n\nWe gotta make a change.  Schools can still teach driver's ed, but no one under 18 should be behind the wheel.  We could still have those provisional permits and all that, but the focus needs to shift to safety, man.  Everyone needs to be on board with this, all across the country.  It's the only way to keep those kids safe.",
            "So, I was lookin' through some old Edison movies at the Library of Congress, see?  There were like fifteen of these \"trick\" movies from  back in the day, between 1895 and 1901. Ya know, the ones that use fancy cuttin' and stuff to make ya think things are happenin' that ain't.\n\nI mostly wanted to figure out how these trick movies worked, ya know? Like, what made 'em tick? I looked at most of 'em and saw they were pretty much the same way.  They used these set things, like a stage, and the camera just sat there, not movin' an inch. No zoomin', no fancy stuff like that.  They'd just film everything in one long shot, like they were  puttin' on a show.\n\nAnd speaking of shows, these trick movies were pretty much like vaudeville acts.  The guys in 'em would  dance around and make things disappear and reappear, like magic. But there wasn't much story to 'em, just a bunch of quick tricks. \n\nOne thing that really stuck out was how they filmed 'em. They always used these big, wide shots, like you're lookin' at a whole stage.  No close-ups, nothin' like that.  And the actors, they never came closer to the camera than the middle of the stage.\n\nAnother thing is, each trick movie was like one long take, ya know? Like, they'd film the whole thing in one go, without cuttin' to different shots.  So, most of 'em were only a minute or two long.\n\nBut hey, even though they were simple, these trick movies were pretty cool for their time. They were like the ancestors of all the fancy movies we got nowadays.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this dude John Taylor, he was a real go-getter back in the day. This guy was all about that farming life, and lemme tell ya, he wasn't afraid to speak his mind about how the government should be run. He thought farming was the best gig there was, and he wanted to make sure the government didn't mess it up. He was all about personal liberty, you know, doing what you want as long as you don't hurt nobody. \n\nThis Taylor dude thought the US had a golden chance to build a perfect system 'cause there weren't no old ways to get in the way. He believed folks should be free to do their own thing, and that the government shouldn't be bossing folks around. He thought if one right gets squashed, they all start to crumble, and nobody's really free.\n\nNow, Taylor, he was a firm believer in good and bad. He thought folks are naturally a mix of both, and the government had to be built to deal with that.  He thought a good government protects your stuff, helps farmers out, and keeps big businesses from gettin' too powerful. He believed a good government should be fair, even if the folks running it are lookin' out for themselves.  He thought everyone's got their own agenda, but that's okay as long as it doesn't hurt others. He figured a good government keeps things in check so folks don't get too greedy.\n\nTaylor, like a lot of his buddies back then, thought the Constitution should be read straight up, no fancy interpretations. He wanted the government to have just the powers listed in that document, 'cause he knew big government was a recipe for trouble.  But he also thought just reading the words wasn't enough; you gotta understand what the guys who wrote it meant. He even thought the Declaration of Independence was more important than the Constitution 'cause it talked about states bein' independent more clearly.",
            "So, like, check this out. We were trackin' these commuters, right? Figure 17 shows that, BAM! In the third month, people stopped fillin' out the forms. Kinda bummer, ya know? Dunno why it happened, but maybe winter hit hard and folks just weren't bikin' or walkin' as much. December is also when school gets crazy with finals and stuff, so maybe loggin' commutes just flew outta their minds. Plus, the holidays hit hard – everyone's gone, no campus, nothin'. Then January rolls around, school starts back up, but still, not many logs. February was especially weird, though.\n\nMaybe it's just that, like, new projects have a burst of energy at first, then kinda fizzle out. To fight that, we did this whole \"Carpool Challenge Week\" thing in March, and, boom! More logs! So, we had this problem of folks just losing interest, plus all the breaks and stuff.  \n\nAnother thing is that people, like, LOVE their cars. It's, like, in our culture. So, to get people to ditch the car, gotta give 'em something good. We threw out gift cards for restaurants, coffee, massages, even bookstores. But, I wonder if something bigger woulda worked, like, a sweet bike, a hybrid car, or even an electric one! Maybe that woulda kept things pumpin'.\n\nWe didn't change up the prizes much. If we upped the ante, though, maybe things woulda been different. Maybe if we started with gift cards and then, in December, announced a few bikes, and then, in January, a hybrid or electric car, more people woulda hopped on board.",
            "Yo, lemme break down this ETF thing for ya.  Think of it like this: it's like a stock that tracks a bunch of other stuff, like a whole bunch of companies or even somethin' crazy like gold.  It's kinda like a stock, but it's got more wiggle room.\n\nYou get the cool stuff from a regular stock, like buyin' just one share or even sellin' it short, but it's also spread out like a regular fund, so you don't put all your eggs in one basket.\n\nNow, here's the kicker: these things are cheaper than most funds.  But, there's a catch, ya gotta pay to buy and sell them, just like regular stocks.\n\nAnyway, there's tons of different ETFs out there, so you gotta figure out what's best for you.\n\nSo, let's take this one ETF, IHF, and see if it's really worth it.\n\nWe're gonna look at the top ten companies it's holdin' onto, 'cause those make up most of the ETF.\n\nWe wanna see if just buyin' those ten companies straight up would be better than buyin' the whole ETF.  \n\nWe're gonna compare their returns and how risky they are.  Turns out, just buyin' those top ten companies might actually give you more bang for your buck and less risk!  \n\nBut hold on a sec, maybe we just got lucky with these ten.  We gotta make sure it's not just a fluke.\n\nSo we're gonna check the spread of those companies, just to be sure.\n\nLet's see what we got!",

This poem by Poe, \"Dream-Land,\" is supposed to be one of his best, but it's got this crazy thing going on with this word \"Thulé.\"  Turns out, Poe was a big fan of this German dude named Goethe, and he used the same word in one of his poems, \"The King of Thulé.\"  \n\nSee, in Poe's poem, Thulé is like this far-off island, kind of like the edge of the world.  And in Goethe's poem, it's about this king who's super messed up because his wife died. He's all gloomy and drinks himself silly, and eventually just takes his own life. \n\nSome folks say Poe was totally copying Goethe, but hey, even if he was, it's still a pretty cool connection, right? \n\nPoe even uses \"Thulé\" twice in this other poem, \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"  It's like he's obsessed with the place!  And you know what? Both poems are about this dark, lonely feeling, like you're surrounded by ghosts and everything's kinda gray.\n\nPoe might've been a bit of a goth, but he knew his stuff. He was buddies with Tennyson, who was also into Goethe, so it's no surprise Poe was too.",

He knew the spill was dangerous, but he didn't do nothin' about it.\n\nThink about it: two employees tell him about the spill, he doesn't care. Then, BAM! Jennifer goes down. It's like he didn't even care about her safety or anyone else's!

            "Man, lemme tell ya, back in the day, like almost four years ago, I took this Islam class at CBC. We were always going at it about whether Islam was this, like, scary religion or not. Feels even more real now than it did back then, ya know? I mean, look at the news since 9/11. First, it was all doom and gloom about Islam and these crazy extremists. Now? It's like everyone's suddenly best buddies with Muslims. I swear, back in '01, we'd never have had a prez-wannabe named Borac Obama, who's got family with, like, super obvious Muslim roots. \n\nThis Muhammad dude's story is wild. See, I thought he was this big-time conqueror, forcing people to become Muslims, you know?  But this biography paints him as this martyr, this misunderstood guy who was all humble and stuff. Everyone just kinda saw the light and flocked to him. It's like they're trying to make him look like some kinda Jesus-lite, but let me tell ya, it's kinda sus.\n\nAnd get this: there are some seriously crazy similarities between how Jesus and Muhammad supposedly worked their miracles. Like, Muhammad turning a little mutton and milk into a feast for forty dudes?  That's textbook Jesus stuff, dude!  They're practically stealing Jesus' thunder with all this \"humble prophet\" nonsense. It's like they're trying to make Muhammad look just as awesome as Jesus, but without the real deal.\n\nAnd then there are these stories about how people all converted to Islam on their own. But hold on a sec, a lot of them are just third-hand accounts, like \"So-and-so told me that his buddy heard from another guy who said...\"  It's like they're trying too hard to prove a point, but it just makes it all seem fishy.\n\nHonestly, what really bugs me is how they try to make Muhammad out to be this saintly, gentle, wise dude. But history says otherwise! He was a conqueror, a rough-around-the-edges kind of guy. Makes me wonder if Muslims today even know the real story behind their prophet.",
            "Okay, so lemme tell ya something about this whole Jesus thing. It's like, way back when, folks were all about his teachings, you know? But then things started changing. Christianity went in all sorts of directions, kinda like a runaway roller coaster,  getting further and further from the original path. \n\nNowadays, things are lookin' different. People are gettin' more open-minded, y'know,  thinkin' outside the box. There are still those who cling to the old ways, but they're not really makin' much waves. \n\nBut get this, in the future, folks are gonna start lookin' back. They're gonna wanna know what Jesus REALLY meant, separate from all the stuff that got added over time. It might take a while, years, maybe even centuries, but it's gonna happen.\n\nChristianity's gonna rewind, back to its roots, like a time machine. People are gonna ditch the extra stuff, layer by layer, until it's just pure Jesus, like it was back in the day.  \n\nIt'll start in the US and Europe, then spread like wildfire. People are gonna be worshipin' like it's Jesus' time again, just followin' his teachings.\n\nThe churches will still be there, leadin' the way, but things will be different. All the different groups, all the denominations, they'll start lookin' more alike than before. It'll be a big reunion, back to the basics.\n\nHistory's full of these big shifts, y'know? Like when the Romans were persecutin' Christians, and then BAM!  They became Christians themselves. Or how America went from slavery to Black leaders. \n\nThis big change comin' in Christianity, it's gonna be like that. It's gonna undo history, find the source, and bring everyone together.\n\nBut here's the thing: They're gonna have to see Jesus' words in a new way, kinda like metaphors, not just plain ol' facts.\n\nSo, what happened since Jesus' time?  Well, it all started with Judaism, that's the foundation, y'know?  They were all about one God,  holy books, and stuff like that.  But even then, they weren't all on the same page. They had different groups, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and a bunch of others.",

It's all about the bottom line.\n\nThis one part in the book, it talks about how these factories are like, massive things smokin' up the sky, spewin' out pollution everywhere. It's like they don't even care about the air we breathe or nothin'. And the places where they keep the animals, it's a total mess!  Just piles of crap everywhere. They don't care about the animals, either.\n\nAnd get this, these factory bosses, they treat their workers like garbage! They work 'em to the bone, no breaks, no nothin', and then bam! They just fire 'em without a second thought. Like they're just tools, ya know? There were no rules back then to protect workers, so these guys could get away with anything.\n\nThe workers were stuck in this crazy system, workin' themselves to death just to survive.

Scott Fitzgerald, that dude was a master. He throws these crazy adjective combos at ya, like words that don't usually hang out together. He also plays with symbols, like colors, to pump up the vibes.\n\nFitzgerald's obsessed with colors, man. Gold, green, white, gray, and red, he throws 'em all around. He gives 'em special meanings and then uses 'em to mess with your head about important stuff. \n\nTake white and gray, for instance. He builds up this whole thing about white being fancy and gray being faded and old. He drops these colors everywhere from the get-go. Daisy and Jordan, they're always decked out in white, like it's their uniform. Even Nick, he's rocking \"white flannels\" to Gatsby's wild parties. Tom's got his \"white shirt\" on when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine's all \"powdered milky white.\" It's like everyone's drowning in white.\n\nExcept at Gatsby's bash, where it's all \"gaudy with primary colors.\"  Fitzgerald keeps hammering these colors into your brain. Nick's work trip takes him down \"white chasms\" in New York.  Names at Gatsby's party become just \"gray names\" on his list. Even Catherine's apartment, it's just another \"slice in a long white cake\" of buildings. Straight-up uniformity.\n\nHe uses these colors for the regular folk too.  Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" together. There's \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the Valley of Ashes. The Italian kid on the railroad? \"Gray.\" Even the dog-seller's a \"gray old man.\"\n\nSo, once Fitzgerald's got you seeing white and gray as boring and ordinary, he uses them on Daisy. She suddenly pops up in \"white\" in a \"little white roadster.\"  It's like she's not even a real person anymore, just something Gatsby wants. \n\nHe keeps doing this to Daisy, like she's just a faded picture. \"Gray haze of Daisy's fur collar,\" \"white dress\" before Tom and Gatsby's showdown. It's like Fitzgerald's saying, \"Daisy? Nah, she's just another white, gray thing.\"",

It's like, you can help out the planet, grow some sweet food, and have a blast doing it!\n\nNow, growing organic stuff ain't always easy, ya know?

This piece of land could be a real game-changer, a place where you can grow food, help nature, and make some dough!  \n\nI found this real farm in the same area doing all this stuff, and it's inspiring, man! It's proof that you can do good and make a living at the same time.",
            "Alright, listen up, 'cause this is important for any time ya gotta make a deal with someone who ain't exactly from around the block. See, culture, it ain't just some fancy word, it's like the air you breathe, it shapes how ya think, how ya talk, how ya even eat your tacos. Each group's got its own flavor, its own way of doin' things, and you gotta respect that.\n\nThinkin' all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are super chill? Nah, that's just plain wrong. It's like sayin' all cats are lazy just 'cause you met one who was snoozin' in a sunbeam.  Ya gotta dig deeper and figure out what makes that culture tick, how they see the world, 'cause that's gonna affect how they bargain.\n\nWhen you're dealin' with folks from a different world, ya gotta remember, you see things through your own lens, ya know?  It's like lookin' at a picture through a funhouse mirror, things are a bit warped. So, instead of judgin' or tryin' to change 'em, just accept 'em for who they are, like a weird but cool uncle at a family reunion.  And especially if you're the one with less muscle at the table, ya gotta play nice.\n\nCulture ain't just about countries, either. Even within a company, there's different vibes. Some places are all about grindin' 24/7, others are more laid-back.  You can tell by how folks dress, how they talk, even who gets the fancy corner office.\n\nValues, those are the real deal, they're the \"why\" behind a culture. If a place values respect and harmony, they ain't gonna pull any dirty tricks to win a deal. And if they're all about gettin' the best bang for their buck, they ain't gonna back down easy.\n\nSo, before you even show up to the negotiation, do your homework. Learn about the other side, their customs, their values, their quirks. And hey, maybe even find out what their favorite pizza topping is. You never know, a little common ground can go a long way.",
            "\"A dumb dude once said, 'There ain't no God!'\" That's what Psalm 14 in the Bible says, and it's where St. Anselm starts talkin' about how God exists. Seems like Thomas Aquinas, another brainy dude we're gonna check out, agrees with that.  \n\nNow, they both think God is real, but we gotta stick to the same God they're talkin' about - the one from the Bible. If we start messin' around with different Gods,  it's like comparing apples and oranges. We gotta see which argument for *this* God is stronger.\n\nLook, both Anselm and Aquinas make some good points, but neither one really lays out a totally rock-solid reason to believe in God.  \n\nLet's break down Anselm first. He says we can find God by lookin' inside ourselves. He's sayin' that because God exists in our minds, we can't even imagine him not bein' real. It's kinda like sayin' that because you know somethin' exists in your head, it must be real. He's sayin' faith is enough, we don't need proof. \n\nNow, Thomas Aquinas is all about logic and proof, no faith needed. He's got five big arguments for God, sayin' that lookin' at the world around us shows us God's gotta be there. He's like, \"Look at all this stuff, it couldn't just happen by chance, there's gotta be a reason!\"",
            "A long time ago, way back in the 500s BC, a prince was born who would later become known as Buddha. He decided to ditch all the fancy stuff of being a prince and became super wise. His teachings about life and stuff started something called Buddhism. There are lots of different types of Buddhism, but the oldest one is called Theravada. It's been around for more than 2,500 years, and it's changed a lot since Buddha's time.\n\nFor example, in Sri Lanka, a place where Theravada Buddhism is really big, they do this cool water-cutting ceremony every year. Monks and regular folks all join in, and it's pretty important to them even though Buddha never said anything about it. This shows how Buddhism has changed, from little things like ceremonies to really big ideas about what it means to be Buddhist.\n\nOver time, both monks and regular people who practice Theravada Buddhism have had to change how they understand the religion. This happened because of stuff happening inside and outside of Buddhism. Sometimes it was good stuff, sometimes it was bad. \n\nWe're gonna use some special words a lot: \"internal\" means something from inside Buddhism, like decisions made by Buddhist people, whether they're monks or not. \"External\" means something from outside Buddhism, like stuff from other religions or cultures. \"Hostile\" means something that wants to hurt Buddhism, and \"benign\" means something that doesn't care about helping or hurting Buddhism, but might end up doing one or the other by accident.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in finding peace and happiness by following the \"Triple Gem\": the Buddha himself, his teachings (called the Dhamma), and the community of Buddhists (called the Sangha). The Dhamma is like a big library of Buddhist writings. It has three main parts: the Suttas (Buddha's talks), the Vinaya (rules for monks), and the Abhidhamma (deep philosophical stuff).  \n\nA lot of Buddhist ideas are based on these things: Anatta (no permanent soul), Dukkha (life is full of suffering), and Anicca (everything is always changing). Buddhists believe that by understanding these things, they can escape the cycle of death and rebirth called Sansara. They also try to let go of desire, anger, and confusion (lobha, dosa, moha) so they can reach enlightenment. The Vinaya tells monks how to live their lives, with lots of rules for being good and ethical.  \n\nThe most important thing in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. The first is that life is full of suffering (Dukkha). The second is that suffering comes from clinging to things (attachment). The third is that suffering can end. The fourth is that there's a path to end suffering (The Eightfold Path).",
            "So, get this, America and Mexico, they had this huge beef going on for like, 57 years.  It all started back in 1836 and went on till 1893. These guys were always at each other's throats! The worst part was this thing called the Mexican-American War, where America basically jumped Mexico. They won, of course, and took Texas and a bunch of land in the Southwest. Talk about a power move!\n\nThere were tons of other skirmishes between them, but things finally cooled down right before World War I. You see, they just couldn't see eye to eye on stuff like religion, culture, and who got what. It's like when your siblings fight over the TV remote, but on a whole other level.\n\nThis whole thing reminds me of other neighborly feuds, ya know? Countries that share a border tend to butt heads over stuff. It's like, you're both trying to claim the same parking spot, only with countries and land. \n\nOne guy, David, said that America only really had major problems with Mexico and Cuba. These two countries, being right next door, were always causing trouble. Meanwhile, other Latin American countries were chillin' with the US.\n\nReligion was a big deal too. Back then, America was all about not being Catholic or monarchy, kinda like how they were against communism and fascism later on. It's all about what you believe, I guess.\n\nThis whole distrust thing went way back to the whole English and Spanish thing. They were never really cool with each other, so it spilled over into America and Mexico's relationship.\n\nThese two countries had a ton of disagreements, mostly about borders and stuff.  Bandits and outlaws would just cross back and forth, causing mayhem. Both sides had to put a stop to it with some serious muscle.\n\nEventually, things started to calm down because Mexico needed America's help, kinda like relying on a sibling for homework. And then, America shifted from wanting more land to wanting to control Mexico's economy.  That was the end of the big rivalry.",
            "Fifteen years ago, bam! Life threw me a curveball. I got hit with this sickness outta nowhere, one I'd never even heard of. Talk about a shocker! I was a nurse back then,  a job I picked for the safety and security I craved ever since I was a kid. \"You can always find work as a nurse, people always get sick, right?\" That's what everyone told me growing up. So, even though my real dream was to be a scientist or maybe even a journalist, I ended up in scrubs. \n\nBut there I was, 46 years old, single, and out of a job, thanks to this mysterious illness. Fifteen years of relying on Social Security Disability later, and let me tell you, I'm down to my last dime.  I scrape by, but every day feels like a fight to keep my head above water. My security, my safety, my self-esteem – it's all shaky ground. Nothing feels certain anymore. But here's the thing: I wouldn't have made it this far without my family and a few good friends.  Believe me, when life throws a real curveball, you realize just how much you need others.\n\nLife's gonna throw curveballs, big and small, no matter how prepared you think you are. Sometimes, you just need a helping hand. I totally get the whole \"don't rely on big government\" thing.  Let's face it, the system's got more holes than a Swiss cheese. But instead of everyone hunkering down in their own fallout shelters,  wouldn't it be better if we started trusting each other again?  Learning to help each other out, to ask for help when we need it?\n\nSure, people talk about \"rugged individualism\" being what built this country. But the truth is, our ancestors didn't cross the Rockies alone. They relied on each other, on compassion, respect, and sharing what they had.\n\nSo, yeah, be prepared. I am. I've got my disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purification tablets, even duct tape for the windows. I've got flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and a whole pantry of canned goods. If you've got the space and the know-how, grow your own food, learn to can it.  A wood stove's a good idea too, unless you're living in an apartment.\n\nBut here's the real takeaway: get to know your neighbors. You never know when you'll need them.",
            "So, you're wondering how things like bugs and clams and stuff get so weird lookin', right? Like, why'd they evolve to look that way? And what stops 'em from just getting totally bonkers? Back in 1917, this guy D'Arcy Thompson was like, \"Man, we're just scratching the surface of figuring out how to describe even the simplest living thing with math.\" And, guess what? It's still kinda true today!\n\nBut hey, lately folks have been trying to use math to figure out how shells, those crazy coiled things, grow and change over time. Think of it like this: imagine a snail's shell is a tube that's constantly spinning around in a circle, like a super-slow tornado. Each twist of that tube is called a whorl, and they all spiral around a central point called the columella.\n\nWe can measure stuff like how big the whorls get and how fast they grow, and we can even use computers to make fake shells and see what's possible. We're using X-rays to get a good look at real shells, then we're plugging those measurements into this software called CerioShell. It's like building a digital toolbox for understanding how shells change over time.\n\nWe're combining all this with experiments and observations to try and understand how big changes happen in nature, like when a species evolves into something totally new. It's like solving a giant puzzle, piece by piece.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya about Indonesia's health scene, it's kinda messed up.  \n\nSee, for the last ten years, babies ain't been doin' so hot.  Sure, they're makin' progress on things like clean water and toilets, but when it comes to keepin' moms and kids healthy, they're way behind.  They gotta step it up if they wanna hit their goals by 2015. \n\nThey're sayin' that more babies are bein' born with a doctor or midwife around, which is cool, but a lot of those midwives ain't qualified for emergencies.  So, even though they got more folks around, it ain't actually makin' things safer for moms.   \n\nPlus, fewer kids are seein' doctors for tummy troubles, and they ain't trackin' how many folks are gettin' checkups after they have a baby.  That ain't a good sign.\n\nThey ain't doin' enough C-sections either, especially in the country.  In the city, it's 7%, but in the sticks, it's only 2%!  That means folks in the country ain't gettin' the same care. And the poor folks are havin' a real hard time gettin' to the doctor.  They can't afford it, ya know?\n\nSo, what's the deal?  Should they just focus on one specific problem or fix the whole health system?  Easy programs sound good, but they can suck the funding away from other important stuff.  Plus, you end up with a bunch of separate programs doin' the same thing, which is a headache and a waste of money.",
            "So, like, Victorian books are all about being super detailed and, like, obsessed with rich people, ya know?  But then there are these two books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" that are kinda different. They're still from that time period, but they're more mysterious and, like, kinda freaky, which is totally not what you'd expect.  It's kinda cool 'cause it makes the characters way more interesting. You get a better sense of what makes them tick, y'know?\n\nTake this crazy passage from \"Oliver Twist,\" for example: \n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n\n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nIt's like Oliver is having a totally messed-up dream, right? And these weird dreams and stuff are kinda common in both \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights.\" They help us understand what's going on inside the characters' heads, like what's hurting them and how they really feel about stuff.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" these weird experiences often show us Oliver's inner turmoil.  When he remembers getting shot, it's like he's reliving it all over again in a dream. It's super intense, and it shows how scared and helpless he feels. He's totally overwhelmed, and it's like he can't even control what's happening to him. It makes you wonder who's really in charge of his life, because it sure ain't him. This whole shooting thing is super depressing, like Oliver is just giving up, ya know?",
            "A couple years ago, lemme tell ya, I was workin' at this after-school thing, helpin' out little kids with their schoolwork. I was pretty good at English and readin', so that's what I mostly did. One lil' dude, Adrian, he was in third or fourth grade, I think, was really strugglin' with readin'. It was weird, like he knew some letters but others, forget about it! He spoke perfect English, mind you, but readin', it was a whole other story. He was Latino, I'm pretty sure, but that didn't seem to be the problem. We were stuck, until one day, Adrian's mom showed up. Now, she only spoke Spanish, and my Spanish was, well, let's just say it was more like broken Spanish. But somehow, we managed to talk. And then it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet that well! I don't know if it helped him much in the end, but I hope he's doin' better now.\n\nI tell you this story 'cause it shows how tricky things can be with the language barrier in schools, especially here in California.  It ain't always as obvious as you'd think. Even for kids who speak English perfectly, readin' it can still be a real pain.  We all know this problem exists, so what can we do about it?  \n\nFor Adrian, it was pretty simple: some extra help with English readin', focusin' on the alphabet and sounds. But for kids who barely speak English, it's a whole different ballgame. There ain't no one-size-fits-all solution. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these things alone are gonna fix it. You gotta use a mix of everything!\n\nFirst off, dual language programs are a great idea, not just for kids whose first language is Spanish, but for everyone.  Kids in those programs do better in school, you know? People get scared about it, thinkin' it's a waste of money and that most kids won't benefit. But that ain't true. If we made these programs the norm, not the exception, everyone would be better off. \n\nNow, how do we do that?  Do we make all teachers bilingual? That's a bit much, right?  But I think we should definitely have bilingual helpers, tutors, whatever you wanna call 'em.",
            "Mack's latest robot was a pink bunny with a drum. Pathetic, I tell ya!  Kicked it once, battery popped right out.  Meanwhile, downstairs, some dude got back from filming a marshmallow commercial.  Before he could even get in the door, another guy decked him into a wall.  I bet he left a nice imprint.  Later, Camo and Katt, against his will, somehow got the high score on DDR Max 2.  Oh, and Gage just called.  He's got his dad's Hulk DVD, apparently.  Already saw it in theaters, though.  Ugh, what was I saying?  Oh, right!\n\nMan, when I was a kid, everyone kept telling me there was somethin' bigger out there, somethin' I couldn't even imagine.  Some folks went to Sunday school, others to Temple, some even tried to find answers inside themselves.  Lotta people just took what their parents told 'em, no question asked.  But some of us, we said 'Nah, forget it!' There's nothin' out there but what I see in my own world.  We might start out valuing one thing, then bam!  Suddenly, we're all about somethin' else entirely.  Doesn't matter what path you choose, though.  We're all just trying to figure ourselves out, lookin' for some kinda light in the dark to guide us.  \n\nRemember when my old man told me his favorite bird was a cardinal?  We were sittin' on the porch, rain beatin' down on that tin roof like crazy, both of us smokin' our cigarettes.  The gutters were overflowin', drownin' all the plants by the edge.  He was lookin' out at the rain, kinda lost in thought, like he was searchin' for somethin' or rememberin' somethin' else. He'd gotten thinner these past few months, clothes hangin' off him like a bad joke.  His hair was thinner too, not as full as I remembered.  He wouldn't look at me, just kept lookin' at that rain.  I felt all alone and scared, but couldn't bring myself to talk to him about missin' him.  Didn't wanna make it real for either of us.  So I just hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in starin' out at the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away in December that year, five days after my 22nd birthday.  Chemo and radiation kept him alive a few months longer than the doctors thought, but it didn't ease his pain.  I couldn't see the point of it all.  What kinda God would do that?  I didn't pray that night.  If there was a God, I thought, he stopped listenin' to me a long time ago.\n\nCouldn't bear to watch him go, so I didn't.  Couldn't watch the life that made me end.  I wanted to remember him how he lived, not how he died.  Besides, I knew my dad better than anyone else, even his own family.  He wouldn't want me to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in bed for three days straight, waitin' for the news.\n\nNo one even bothered to call.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this thing called the \"Gothic Novel.\" It's kinda like an oxymoron, ya know? Like, it's both old and new at the same time. This dude Ian Watt, he said that in his book, \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\"\n\nPeople have been talkin' 'bout Gothic novels for ages, sayin' they're either crap or masterpieces. Some say they ain't got no depth, others say they're full of this \"terrible sublime\" stuff.  \n\nSee, the first real Gothic novel was this thing called \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole. He mixed up old-school theater stuff with this newfangled \"nature writing\" thing goin' on at the time. He called it a \"Gothic Story,\" and it kinda blew everyone's minds. \n\nGothic novels are all about lookin' back at that old medieval stuff—the castles, the theaters, the whole vibe. Even back then, the word \"Gothic\" was kinda like a catch-all for anything ancient or, like, uncool compared to the shiny new stuff everyone was into. \n\nThe cool thing about Gothic is that it blends this dramatic, theatrical stuff with this new way of writing novels where you get inside the characters' heads, ya know? That's why it's stuck around for so long, even though it feels kinda outdated sometimes. \n\nOne big thing in Gothic novels is chivalry.  Back in the day, chivalry was all about trainin' up a proper knight, right?  Well, Gothic writers were obsessed with chivalry 'cause it represented this ideal: brave, honorable, the whole deal. They thought society had kinda lost sight of that.\n\nSo, in Gothic novels, they use chivalry to romanticize the past and try to make the present a little better. This guy Walpole, who wrote \"The Castle of Otranto,\" was livin' through some crazy political times. He was probably feelin' pretty down on the world and thought maybe folks back in the day were just better people. He uses chivalry to show that in his story.  \n\nTake this character, Frederic, for example. From the get-go, he's described as this perfect knight: a prince, tragic, probably gonna be a hero.  It's all very dramatic, kinda like a superhero but with swords and stuff.",
            "Alright, so picture this: you wanna get somethin', right? Like, somethin' super-duper awesome from the store.  Well, that's where the whole \"supply chain\" thing comes in. It's like a crazy, awesome rollercoaster ride for stuff, from the moment you say \"I want that!\" all the way to when it lands in your grubby little hands.\n\nThis whole idea came from this guy, Keith Oliver, back in '82. He was like, \"Hey, let's get organized! We gotta make sure peeps get what they want, fast and without any drama!\"  So he came up with this thing called \"supply chain management,\" which is basically like a super-secret recipe for makin' sure stuff gets where it needs to go.\n\nThere are six key ingredients in this recipe: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.  Think of it like buildin' a burger:  you gotta have the right ingredients, the right place to cook it, and a way to get it to the hungry customer!\n\nFirst up is production. That's where the magic happens!  We gotta figure out what peeps want, how much to make, where to make it, and who's gonna make it. It's like, \"Hey, customers love chocolate chip cookies, so let's bake a ton of those!\" Then we gotta figure out where to bake them, what ovens to use, and when to start bakin'.\n\nNext comes supply.  This is where we find the ingredients and the workers.  We gotta make sure we have enough flour, sugar, and chocolate chips, and that our bakers are ready to roll!  Sometimes, we even outsource stuff to other companies, like \"Hey, you guys make awesome sprinkles, can you send us a whole truckload?\"\n\nInventory is like the middleman. It's all about keeping track of how much stuff we have and making sure we don't run out of anything. We don't want anyone to be sad because we're all out of chocolate chips!\n\nLocation, location, location! This is where we decide where to bake those cookies, distribute them, and where customers can buy them.\n\nTransportation is how we get those cookies from the oven to the store. We gotta figure out the fastest, cheapest, and safest way to get those delicious treats to hungry hands.\n\nAnd finally, information is the glue that holds it all together. We gotta keep track of everything - what's being made, where it's going, and when it's arriving.",
            "So, check this out, right? This chick, Ellen Page, the one from Juno, is standing on the corner with a sign. It says, \"Hitler is alive in Burma!\"  Crazy, huh? \n\nNow, Burma, also known as Myanmar, is this place ruled by some seriously messed-up guys. They took over back in 1962, and things haven't been good ever since. A few years back, like 2007, some monks, wearing these saffron robes, started protesting. They called it the \"Saffron Revolution,\" get it? \n\nAt first, the government was all, \"Whatever, monks, chill out,\" but then things got outta hand.  People started joining in, and the government went totally bananas. They cracked down hard, beating monks, shutting down protests, and even locking up journalists. One guy, a photographer from Japan, got killed just for taking pictures! \n\nThey say 13 people died, but some folks in the know say it was way more. Like, thousands. This kinda stuff, it's not new. Governments have always tried to squash anyone who dares to speak up against them.  \n\nRemember the Romans? They thought they were gods, right? And the Japanese emperors? They're supposed to be gods too! And here in America, we got George W. Bush talking to Ted Haggard, the leader of, like, the dumbest people ever. \n\nThere's Tiananmen Square in China, where the government went all crazy on students and protesters.

            "Duke Ellington, man, he was a legend in the jazz world, ya know?  He stuck around forever, and that gave him tons of time to really make his orchestra his own. Sure, he wasn't always front and center on the piano in his tunes, but  this dude could write some seriously complex and cool stuff. \n\nHe knew how to make a song where a guy could go crazy and improvise, but he also knew how to make tight, orchestrated sections that really highlighted what each musician brought to the table.  Like, he'd craft these sounds that were totally unique and made each piece pop.  He was a master at getting the best out of every player, and that's how he made some of the most awesome jazz ever.\n\nThey even say in that big music book, The Grove Music Dictionary, that Ellington was all about using the voice as an instrument, check out his song \"Creole Love Call\" for that. He was using voices for texture and feeling without all that singing stuff. And in that song, he showed how he could make soloists shine, which he did all the time.\n\nIt's a slow blues song, twelve bars, six choruses, each one different. The first chorus is call and response between the voice and the reeds, smooth at first then kinda rough by the end. Chorus two, it's a muted trumpet solo that messes with the melody and throws in some of those bluesy notes. Then chorus three is all clarinet, high and sweet, with the piano adding a little somethin' somethin' underneath. Chorus four is the whole band echoing the first chorus, brass and reeds doin' the call and response thing. Chorus five, this is where it gets wild, the reeds are callin' and respondin' high up, with the brass and rhythm guys doin' this syncopated stop time thing. And the last chorus is back to the first call and response, but this time the voice gets all growl-ey, soloin' like an instrument itself.\n\nThen there's a little tag with the voice doin' some runs and the trombone endin' on this dissonant note, real weird.\n\nEllington used voice like that in a lot of his stuff, adding this extra layer of sound. \n\nHis song \"Hot and Bothered\" is another example of how good he was at orchestrating things and finding those cool sounds. He had \"Bubber\" Miley on trumpet and Baby Cox scatting, and their voices and instruments blended together so well. Then in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" he used Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton on trombone to start the melody, and it sounded killer.",

This emptiness started creepin' in around 14, right when she was hittin' that teenage groove. Three years later, at 17, it was still there, gnawin' at her. Now, she knew it wasn't some material thing she was after, it was somethin' more...someone. But guys? Forget about it. They'd try their cheesy pick-up lines and awkward dances, but nothin' ever clicked. She'd wrack her brain, tryin' to figure out why this was happenin' to her. Theories flew around, but nothin' stuck. So she just kept livin', always questionin', always searchin'.\n\nLife at home was usually chill. Her folks were good people, peaceful and calm. They rarely argued, and even when she tried to push their buttons, it usually ended in a good-natured debate. Her parents were the picture of serenity, but she, well, she was a whirlwind of energy and fun. It was a good mix, made her pretty darn likeable.\n\nBut today? Today was nothin' like usual. She was wanderin' around the house, lookin' for some spark of inspiration, when she heard a yelp from the kitchen. It was her mom's voice, short and sharp.

Mom, what's wrong?!\"  Her mom was sprawled on the floor, lookin' pale and in pain. \"Ow...sweetie...need...hospital,\" her mom gasped, each word a strained effort. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where to meet you,\" she said, her voice shaky but determined. Her mom pointed weakly, and the daughter, thank goodness for those self-defense classes, scooped her up and carried her to the car.\n\nThe hospital was a sensory overload - disinfectant, sick smells, and a palpable fear in the air. But she barely noticed. All her energy was focused on gettin' her mom help. She practically flew through the doors, barkin' for a doctor. Concerned faces swarmed around them, a gurney appeared, and they whisked her mom away.  She sat there, waitin', worry gnawin' at her insides.\n\nTurns out, her mom had been tryin' to reach a vase on a high shelf and took a tumble off the step stool.",
            "Listen up, folks! This study was all about how good that Mediterranean Diet (the Med diet) is for your ticker.  They found that the more you stick to it, the less likely you are to get heart problems or have a stroke.  This fancy \"aMed\" diet is like the Med diet's cooler cousin, with more plants, good fats, and fish, and less of the meaty stuff and bad fats. Think of it like a healthy power-up for your heart!\n\nThere's already been some talk about how the Med diet is good for you, but this study focused on strokes and heart attacks specifically. They followed all these nurses for like 20 years and asked them about what they ate. The nurses were awesome and kept track of their meals for years and years. They even double-checked everything with doctors and records to make sure they were getting it right.\n\nSo, what did they find? Well, the nurses who ate more like they were on vacation in Greece had way less heart problems and strokes. It's like magic, but it's actually science! The more they ate those healthy foods, the better protected they were.",
            "Whoa, dude, picture this: 2007, the USA goes totally bonkers. Like, everyone's outta work, houses are crashing harder than a video game rage quit, and all the big fancy companies are, like, totally toast. This whole mess is still hanging around, so we gotta figure out what went wrong, right?\n\nSo, get this, it all started with some politicians who were, let's just say, not thinking straight. They pushed banks and companies to give out these crazy loans to people who couldn't really afford 'em. It was like handing out candy to a bunch of sugar-crazed kids! And these loans, they weren't even good loans, they were like, \"sub-prime\" or whatever. \n\nMeanwhile, these two guys, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were supposed to be keeping things safe, but they got pressured into bundling up these bad loans into these even weirder things called CDOs and CDSs. It was like a financial game of Jenga, but instead of blocks, they were using people's houses!\n\nWhen folks started missing payments, BAM! The whole thing came crashing down. Banks ran outta cash, and everyone got dragged down with 'em. It was like a domino effect, except way scarier and with way more money involved. \n\nThis whole mess started way back in 1999, when President Clinton was trying to win another term. He wanted to look good, so he relaxed the rules on lending. That was like pouring gasoline on a fire, except the fire was the economy.\n\nSome smart guy named Steven Holmes even saw it coming back then. He wrote about how Fannie Mae was getting pressured to give out more loans, even though it was risky. He warned that it could lead to another big financial disaster, just like the one with the savings and loans back in the 80s. \n\nAnd guess what? He was right!  People started taking out loans they couldn't afford, and they got themselves caught up in all these complicated new types of mortgages. They were buying houses they couldn't really afford, and then they started building stuff on top of stuff, like a financial skyscraper made of wobbly blocks. It was insane!\n\nThen, BOOM! The bubble burst. All those houses that were worth way too much suddenly weren't worth anything. The banks lost tons of money, and some of the biggest companies in the world almost went bankrupt.\n\nIt was a total mess. And it's still affecting us today.",
            "Ugh, exposition. That part in your story where you're supposed to show off your writing skills, wowing everyone with your fancy words and captivating sentences. Or maybe the part where your readers yawn, close their tabs, and mutter curses under their breath. I've seen Dr. Merlin yell at her computer screen when she gets stuck in a giant info-dump, and it's not in a good way.\n\nExposition, my friends, is not your bestie.\n\nYou already know the golden rule of writing: \"Show, don't tell.\" But even I, Dr. Merlin, stumble into those boring, wordy paragraphs where nothing happens, or worse, too much happens all at once. Exposition is that little voice whispering in your ear, urging you to get all the background info out of the way before the real fun begins.  (Don't confuse it with the other voice tempting you to spill every single detail about each character's childhood!)\n\nExposition means dumping a bunch of info on your audience, usually in plain, straightforward language. Think of those long winded scenes in movies where one character drones on and on, giving another character a history lesson, like some kind of real-life \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In writing, it's the author doing the heavy lifting of the telling.\n\nLet me give you an example. Imagine you're reading a story, and you're told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain place and time, they got hitched in a big fancy wedding, and then, bam! Her husband was murdered right in front of her eyes! Would you really want two whole pages dedicated to explaining all that, with the characters only getting two lines of dialogue each? \n\nNah, you'd expect the author to give us a taste of the husband's character, showing us through his words and actions how much he loved his wife. You'd also want to see how the heroine changed and grew because of him, through big gestures and little details.\n\nA good introduction to the husband would make you feel something for him, make you care about his fate. And when he's gone, you'd mourn with the heroine, connecting with her on a deeper level.\n\nIn short, you want substance, not just bare bones.\n\nThink of it like this: \"They met, they married, he died.\"  That's the bare minimum. As a writer, you need to give us the juicy details, the \"meat on the bones.\"\n\nSometimes we're tempted to rush past important stuff. Maybe you have a new character who was in the Air Force, now works the night shift at a gas station, has been married twice, no kids, loves fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the station someday, and just had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nGive us the good stuff!",
            "Mack, why are we even watching the news? This stuff is so boring! The first story was about some dude named Shad Hostettler stabbing his wife in Ashley, Ohio.  Did they even show her face? Nope! Just a picture of Shad lookin' all evil. They said he stabbed her a bunch of times, but that's about it. \n\nThen they talked about some kid, Travis Buyers, getting shot in Sharon Woods. Sounds pretty rough, but they barely said anything.  It's like they don't care 'cause he's black.  Remember that time a white kid went missing? The whole news was obsessed! \n\nNext up, some weirdo shot a hole in a Med-Flight helicopter with a .22! They were offering five grand for info on the shooter, so maybe someone will spill the beans.\n\nThey gave a quick rundown about the weather, sayin' it's gonna be hot and stormy on Saturday.  Typical.\n\nThen they talked about some dude robbing a UDF. They kept sayin' he was a \"dark-skinned black man\" wearing a hoodie. What's with all the emphasis on his race? Sounds like someone's trying to stir up some trouble.\n\nFinally, they had a story about this drug kingpin from Texas named Rene Rodriguez.  They kept saying \"300 months\" instead of 25 years, like that's supposed to sound scarier.  And they mentioned he was Hispanic, which had nothing to do with the story. \n\nThis news is so messed up, I'm outta here!",
            "Brothers, man, they're a crazy bunch. You know how it is, right? It's like, this unbreakable connection, like they're lookin' at each other in the mirror, but seein' even deeper, ya know?  They feel everything together, the good stuff and the bad. Love, pride, jealousy, even that nasty stuff like anger and cruelty - it's all there.\n\nThey get each other like nobody else, and sometimes it gets messy. It's like, when things get rough, that bond just shines through, like a crazy light show. But man, it comes with a price, ya know? You gotta deal with all those emotions, the good and the bad. \n\nSee, when you look your brother in the eye, you see yourself, but not how people see you, but like, the real you. It's all in your actions, what you do and the stuff that comes after. That's where you see your true colors, the real deal.\n\nThere's this story, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" about these two brothers, and they're goin' through all this, ya know? It's got this crazy landscape, like a jungle out there, and these two boys are on this trip that's not gonna end well. There's this fightin' going on inside of 'em, pride and disappointment, and it explodes in this big way. Only one brother makes it out alive. The story shows you how those feelings between brothers can be so intense, and the narrator, he's like, right there in the middle of it all, feelin' everything too. \n\nThe main guy in the story, he's all about pride, ya know? From the start, when he and his little brother, Doodle, go out, he's already got this resentment. He wants a brother who can do all this stuff with him, run races, climb trees, be his buddy. But Doodle's got this heart problem, so he's weak and can't do any of that. Imagine that, your dreams crushed right before your eyes! It's messed up. He even thinks about hurting Doodle, can you believe that? But then Doodle smiles at him, and he's like, \"Aw, forget it, I love this little guy.\"",
            "So, get this. Our brains, they're like, totally crazy complex, right? Kinda like trying to figure out a super complicated video game. Back in the day, people thought our brains were like wax tablets or papyrus – kinda like old school notepads. Then they were all, \"Nah, it's more like a book!\" But now, everyone's like, \"Dude, it's like a computer!\"\n\nBut hold up, these comparisons, they're kinda limited, you know? Like, they can get you thinking some crazy stuff.\n\nSee, all this info comes flooding in through our senses. Our eyes see light, our ears hear sounds, our skin feels stuff, and so on. It's all turned into these electrical signals – like, the language of our brain.\n\nAnd then the brain does this crazy thing. It processes this info, like, a million different ways. It starts with the basics – like, \"Hey, there's a black thing on a white thing.\" Then it's like, \"Wait, that black thing looks kinda like a box!\" It uses what it already knows to figure stuff out faster. Kinda like using cheats in a game, you know?\n\nBut here's the thing – our brains are picky. They only pay attention to the important stuff. Like, you see a ton of grass when you look down, but you don't notice every single blade. But if someone says your name in a crowded room, BAM, you hear it loud and clear.\n\nAnd then there's memory. Our brains are like, \"Ooh, gotta store that!\" There's short-term memory – like remembering your last pizza topping – and long-term memory – like remembering your first pet's name. They store stuff in different ways, kinda like different folders on a computer.\n\nBut how is all this knowledge organized? There are tons of theories about that, like, maybe it's like a giant web of connections, or maybe it's like a library with books on every topic.\n\nThe brain is seriously mind-blowing, man.",
            "Yo, check it! Aldous Huxley's book, \"Brave New World,\" is like, totally a warning about tech and money stuff runnin' wild.  He paints this messed-up future where everyone's all about being part of the crew and gettin' instant happiness, you know? It's like a big, messed up game where people are just pawns,  followin' the rules set by this dude, the World Controller. It's kinda like what Marx woulda said, you dig?  Huxley's got this lowkey suspicion about how these systems are gonna mess things up.  He uses words like \"homogeny\" and \"reification,\" which are like,  big Communist vibes, to show how messed up it is.\n\nBasically, Huxley's saying capitalism is a scam. They keep us blind to how the rich really get rich, 'cause we're all too busy chasin' our own little pleasures.  It's like brainwashing, man!  The World Controller's like the big boss, makin' everyone crave stuff they don't need.  He's got all the power, and the lower classes are just slaves to the system. They don't even know they're bein' controlled. They're like, \"Yeah, this is great! More stuff!\" \n\nAnd the relationships? Forget about it! There's no real connection between people. They're just empty shells, man.  Huxley's sayin' that technology and money are killin' our soul, makin' us shallow and heartless.  Love?  Emotions?  Nah, not in this world. It's all about lookin' good and havin' a good time, even if it's fake.  It's a total bummer, dude.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya, gettin' around this crazy place, University Park, is a real pain in the tailfeather! I've been here for like, two and a half years, four and a half semesters, and lemme tell ya, it's a jungle out there! My freshman year, they stuck me in East Halls, man, like, the farthest point east on campus.  Forget the stadium and that Bryce Jordan Center thing, they're still closer to civilization than that!\n\nSo, picture this: I gotta trek from my East Halls bunker all the way to Willard, which is like, smack dab in the middle of this campus, just to get to class. On foot, it'd take me 25 minutes, even longer if the weather decides to throw a tantrum, which, let's be real, it does all the time here in State College.\n\nI was talkin' to this dude, a grad not much older than myself, and he spilled the beans:  used to be, East Halls was like, surrounded by a freakin' desert, all empty land. Now? Boom! Sports fields, massive buildings, even a new Creamery and a fancy new health center! And apartments everywhere! This campus keeps growing, but getting around? Getting worse, dude.\n\nSo, what's the answer to this mobility mess? Bikes, man! Bikes are the key! But wait, it ain't just about the bike itself. Students gotta ride 'em, and the damn campus needs to play nice with us cyclists.\n\nI was hangin' out with my buddy, he got back on the bike after a few years off. Said he couldn't believe he ever stopped. \"Bikes are awesome,\" he said, \"it's like, the only way to get around.\" They're good for your body, too. Trust me, a bowl of oatmeal and a little pedal power, you'll be cruisin' 30 miles in no time.\n\nLike, most of the students here, I live off campus now. Just as far from the center as some dorms. Best decision I made this year? Bought a bike. Now I got class in Thomas building, a good 25-minute walk from my place. Bike? Five minutes flat if I'm feelin' speedy!\n\nBut here's the catch: Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas, but it ain't always a bike-friendly street, you know? Walkin' ain't bad, but I'm too busy for that. No bike, I'm stuck walkin' to class every day. That's like, 30-40 minutes each way, man! Over two and a half hours every week! Forget about it! That's time I don't got."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "Dude, lemme tell ya about my plans for the future! I'm all about helping out kids who've been through some rough stuff, like abuse or neglect. I wanna work with the Division of Family and Children Services, ya know, be a real hero for those little guys. And hey, I wanna help out families too, get 'em back on track and all that. \n\nI'm all about those core values, the good stuff: helping out, treating everyone with respect, being honest and ethical, and always working to make things better. Not just for other people, but for myself too. Gotta keep learning and growing, right?\n\nSee, I've always wanted to make a difference, but I wasn't sure how. In school, I saw a lot of people trying to escape their problems, some even using pretty messed-up ways to cope. It made me realize that I wanted to do something about it.\n\nSo I went for a Psychology degree, figured it would give me some tools. But after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, ya know, just to chill. One day, a friend introduced me to this kid, just sixteen, sitting like a scared puppy on her couch. Turns out, he was escaping his abusive parents.\n\nThe next day, I heard he called the cops! So I hopped over to his parents' place, just to see if I could help. I told the cops about my degree and my concerns. They asked me to talk to the parents, 'cause there wasn't much they could do.\n\nMan, those parents were shifty! They were nervous and blaming the kid for everything, calling him \"manipulative\" for reaching out for help. That's when I knew, I had to do something. I gotta help these kids, even if it's just to give them a voice. Social work, that's where I gotta be.\n\nAnd hey, it's not just about helping kids, it's about social justice too.  We talk about how important individuals are, but then we expect everyone to be the same.  I'm an individual, and I don't like being boxed in.\n\nThroughout high school and college, I fought for what's right: dyed my hair crazy colors, wore what I wanted, pierced my ears, joined that GSBA thing (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and stood up against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it.  \n\nI'm all about social justice, man. Always will be.",
            "Alright, so check this out!  We're gonna dive into the whole sleep thing, especially this thing called insomnia. There are these two main ways people look at why it happens – the \"it's all in your genes and your body\" way, and the \"it's all about your surroundings and who you hang with\" way. We're gonna check out some studies that back up each idea and see if they hold water.  \n\nSo, basically, sleep problems come in all shapes and sizes. You got your primary sleep messes, like insomnia (can't fall asleep!) or hypersomnia (can't stay awake!).  Then there are sleep problems caused by other mental stuff or even medical conditions.  And don't forget the wild ones - sleepwalking, nightmares, the whole shebang!\n\nWe're gonna focus on insomnia here, and how the \"it's in your genes\" crew and the \"it's all about your life\" crew explain it.\n\nThe \"it's in your genes\" people talk about how your brain is wired for sleep. There are these tiny parts in your brain called neurons that control when you're sleepy and when you're not. They're like little switches that flip back and forth. Scientists did an experiment with mice and found that these neurons have special receptors that can be turned on or off, and when they're turned off, it makes the mice sleepy! \n\nThis means that maybe, just maybe, some people are born with these receptors that don't work quite right, making it harder for them to fall asleep.  If that's the case, it's kinda like a built-in sleep problem. \n\nAnd the \"it's your life, man\" people say that your environment and experiences play a big role too. Where you live, who you hang out with, even your job – all that stuff can mess with your sleep.\n\nSo, who's right? Probably both! It's probably a mix of your genes and your life experiences that make insomnia happen.",

It's like trying to listen to a conversation in a crowded room where everyone's talkin' at once. You can hear all the words, but it's hard to make sense of it all. \n\nSo, how do ya know if someone's got CAPD? Well, look out for these red flags: they might have trouble tellin' where sounds are comin' from,  mixin' up similar sounds, or catchin' changes in tone, like when someone's bein' sarcastic.  They might also have a hard time followin' instructions or understandin' what people are sayin' when there's lots of background noise.\n\nNow, imagine you're a teacher and one of your students has CAPD. Don't worry, there are things you can do to help 'em out!  Make sure they sit near the front of the classroom, minimize distractions, and break down instructions into smaller, simpler steps.

Some folks are cool with it, but others might get mad that you tricked 'em. So, you gotta choose: stay true to yourself or keep the peace with the peeps around ya.\n\nThis whole gender-bending thing makes it even trickier.

It works, but it also keeps her from connecting with other women. Plus, it messes things up with Olivia and Orsino, who both kinda fall for her. \n\nIt's like, is Olivia into Viola because she thinks she's a guy, or does Olivia secretly like women?  Who knows! Maybe Shakespeare is just messing with us, showing how people can be shallow and judge based on looks.  It's kinda funny, but also kinda messed up.\n\nThe whole thing makes you think about how pretending can bring out hidden feelings.

Not cool, right?  \n\nNow, I ain't sayin' all the Germans were bad.  They had different ways of doin' things in different places, kinda like how my buddy Camo does things his own way.  Sometimes they even did good stuff, like teachin' folks in places like East Africa (Tanganyika).  When those Brits showed up in 1919, they were surprised to see so many smart Africans who knew how to read and write!  Even in Kamerun, they got praise for their schools.\n\nBut in South West Africa, it was a whole 'nother story.  No fancy state schools for the locals there.  It was all up to these missionary folks, who didn't get much help from the government.  They did spend a lot of dough on schools for the Europeans though, which ain't right!  This messed things up for a long time, even after the Germans packed up and left.  While other places had lots of educated Africans, South West Africa was left behind.\n\nSo why the difference?  Well, there's a bunch of reasons, and folks are still tryin' to figure it all out.  It's got to do with how the settlers felt about the local folks, and what the government wanted.  There are tons of books about this stuff, mostly written by Germans back in the day.  They mostly just described the schools, but some folks have been diggin' deeper, comparing different colonies and lookin' at what made them tick.  One guy named Cohen did a good job lookin' at South West Africa and East Africa, and he thinks the big settler population in South West Africa had a lot to do with the different education system.  He's probably right, 'cause South West Africa was pretty nice for Europeans compared to other places.  They had good weather and lots of room to spread out.  More folks wanted to move there, which changed everything.",

I mean, you got your rock, your rap, your country, your jazz, your folk, and then each of those has like a million different flavours, right?  It's crazy!

It's been around for about 40 years and it's gotten so big and wild, it's hard to even describe what it is anymore.\n\nSee, heavy metal is all about going big, ya know? It's got more energy, more noise, more attitude than most music. It's like they crank up the volume to eleven and just let loose. And these guys, they can really play their instruments!  It's not just loud, it's actually good. \n\nBut heavy metal is more than just noise.  It's got this dark side too, like it taps into some deep stuff.  Back when it first started, people were experimenting with drugs, like those crazy psychedelic ones. And that got mixed up with the music, making it sound weirder and wilder. \n\nHeavy metal is also like a big family, with lots of different branches. It's like a tree that keeps growing new branches and leaves.  It's borrowed stuff from other kinds of music too,  but it always stays true to its roots.

See, this guy really wanted to be recognized, to have other artists and art fans all shout his praises. But here's the catch: he was stuck in this awkward spot – should he play it safe and copy the way everyone else was painting to get those fancy art world folks on his side, or should he just go his own way, paint his own crazy vision, even if it meant no one understood? \"The Dream,\" man, that painting is like his big question mark about that whole thing, his inner battle. \n\nYou gotta know a bit about Rousseau's story to get the full picture. He was born way back in 1844, in France. His dad was a pretty well-off hardware guy, but Rousseau never got any fancy art training. He actually worked for the government for years, dealing with tolls and stuff. He lost his first wife and most of his kids, which was a real blow. So, he decided to paint – it was like his escape hatch, a way to start fresh. And get this, unlike some other artists who painted romanticized versions of peasants, Rousseau was a regular guy, painting about the stuff that mattered to regular people.  \n\nRousseau really wanted to be accepted by the art world, and honestly, you can kinda see why. He was older when he started painting, didn't have any fancy education, and he was competing with all these other talented artists who were already famous. It was like trying to break into a club when everyone else already had VIP passes!  Some folks even say that Rousseau wanted his paintings to be so \"normal\" that people would think he was a real \"official\" artist, while Matisse was all about being unique and terrifying the art world with his wild stuff.",
            "A lotta brainy folks think beauty and right and wrong are, like, totally connected. Like, truth AND beauty, you know?  John Keats kinda said it best, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty – That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn a lot from books and stuff, but beauty and right and wrong, they kinda just hit you, ya know?  It's like we get 'em without someone teachin' us. Both beauty and  doing the right thing, they're more about explainin' why something's good or beautiful, rather than makin' rules about how to make it.\n\nThink about it. You can talk all day about why the Mona Lisa is awesome,  mentionin' foregrounds and shadows and stuff, but that don't really say WHY it's so cool. When someone asks about their favorite book or painting, they're gonna say something like, \"There's just something about it,\" before they even start talkin' 'bout the fancy stuff.\n\nArt and morals, they can't be fully explained, ya know? Like Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\"  Even if you describe a book perfectly, there's still somethin' extra, somethin' special, that you can't quite put your finger on.  And that's kinda how it is with morals too.  \n\nI think that's why art and morals are so close. We feel 'em deep down, in a way that's hard to explain.  And with books, it's even stronger. Literature makes us think about what's right and wrong, just like life does. We care about books 'cause they show us those values.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya 'bout Germany, see? This place is somethin' else!  It's strong, it's united, and it's got this crazy cool mix of culture, from the Alps in München all the way to the Baltic Sea in Kiel.  You go from Köln by the Rhine to Dresden on the Elbe, and you just KNOW this place is special.  It's got a history, you know what I mean?  A bunch of different tribes and stuff, all mixin' together to make what Germany is today.\n\nNow, they call this land \"Germania,\" which is kinda a mystery.  Some bloke named Tacitus, way back when, said it came from a tribe called the Tungrians.  They were tough guys, battled the Gauls, crossed the Rhine and all that.  Then there's Julius Caesar, famous for his Roman stuff, who used the word \"Germanus\" to talk 'bout these tribes he was fightin'.  He got it from the Gauls themselves, I guess, to tell 'em apart.  Some think it came from the spear they used, a \"ger,\" or maybe even from an old word for \"shoutin',\" 'cause those Germans were loud!\n\nThis other Roman guy, Tacitus, wrote a whole book about the Germans, sayin' they were the real deal, nothin' mixed in.  He even said, \"Who would leave Asia, Africa, or even Italy for Germany?  It's wild, the weather's bad, the people are grumpy!\"  Guess not many Romans were headin' there. They'd swing by for some goods or a little fight, but mostly they stayed in Rome.  Meanwhile, the Germanic tribes were livin' on the edges of the Roman Empire, sellin' stuff and even joinin' the Roman army.\n\nSo, that's Germany in a nutshell.  A mix of cultures, a history full of stories, and a bunch of tough people who built somethin' special.",
            "Alright, check this out. I'm lookin' at this mess, right? And my brain, it's just... blank. Like, I'm seein' it all, but I ain't really *thinkin* about it. Just like, processin' it, y'know?  Thoughts pop in and outta my head faster than a jackrabbit on a sugar rush.  It's like my mind's on autopilot, just observin', no big deal.\n\nFunny thing is, this reminds me of this art book I got, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  Always wanted to draw, ever since I was a kid.  This book, it breaks down how your brain sees stuff, how to turn a whole kitchen scene, with a bowl of fruit and all that jazz, into just that bowl of fruit, like a simple picture.\n\nBut right now, I can't do that. I'm too blown away! Picasso had his blue phase, Monet went crazy for greens, the Renaissance guys, they loved their rainbows.  If I'm gonna call myself an artist, well, this is my start, my story, my \"Work in Brown,\" get it?\n\nSo, I'm grabbin' my tool, my hand's twitchin', ready to create. Water's swirl  in' peaceful like, clean and clear. Tiny bits break off and float away.  Then my hand jerks, kinda panicky, like I'm scared of missin' somethin'. I slam the toilet handle again.  Nope. Stuck like glue.\n\nI'm standin' there, tie feelin' like a strangler, mop lookin' kinda pathetic in my hand. I gotta stare at this brown mess someone left, like it's a message for the bathroom cleaners.  Flush, think, flush.  Then I grab the toilet paper, wrap it around my hand like a giant oven mitt.  Bend down, my hand goes in the bowl, slow and steady, like I'm gettin' ready to grab a turkey for Thanksgiving.",
            "Yo, check it! Teenagers are like, totally dying behind the wheel, you know? It's a major bummer.  See, the thing is, their brains ain't fully cooked yet, like, they're still developing.  And they're not exactly experienced behind the wheel either. That's a recipe for disaster, man! They're crashing, rolling over, speeding, and driving off the road like it's nothin'.\n\nPlus, they always gotta have their friends in the car, you know how it is.  It's like they can't even drive without a party bus full of buddies.  These scientists did a study and found that the more young passengers, the more accidents.\n\nSo, some states are trying to keep things a little safer with these \"provisional licenses.\"  You know, those things that limit the hours you can drive and who can ride with you.  But, like, that's just a band-aid, man. The real problem is that teens just aren't ready for the heavy stuff.\n\nThis psychologist dude, Marvin Zuckerman, says even 18 is too young to get a license.  He says young people are all about that thrill, you know, pushing the limits just for the rush.  Maybe we should chill on the driving thing until they're a little older, when they've calmed down a bit.\n\nThink about it:  by 2010, a whole bunch of baby boomers' kids will be hitting the road.  We're gonna have a major teen driver explosion, and it's gonna be a mess if we don't do something.\n\nWe gotta make a change.  Schools can still teach driver's ed, but no one under 18 should be behind the wheel.  We could still have those provisional permits and all that, but the focus needs to shift to safety, man.  Everyone needs to be on board with this, all across the country.  It's the only way to keep those kids safe.",
            "So, I was lookin' through some old Edison movies at the Library of Congress, see?  There were like fifteen of these \"trick\" movies from  back in the day, between 1895 and 1901. Ya know, the ones that use fancy cuttin' and stuff to make ya think things are happenin' that ain't.\n\nI mostly wanted to figure out how these trick movies worked, ya know? Like, what made 'em tick? I looked at most of 'em and saw they were pretty much the same way.  They used these set things, like a stage, and the camera just sat there, not movin' an inch. No zoomin', no fancy stuff like that.  They'd just film everything in one long shot, like they were  puttin' on a show.\n\nAnd speaking of shows, these trick movies were pretty much like vaudeville acts.  The guys in 'em would  dance around and make things disappear and reappear, like magic. But there wasn't much story to 'em, just a bunch of quick tricks. \n\nOne thing that really stuck out was how they filmed 'em. They always used these big, wide shots, like you're lookin' at a whole stage.  No close-ups, nothin' like that.  And the actors, they never came closer to the camera than the middle of the stage.\n\nAnother thing is, each trick movie was like one long take, ya know? Like, they'd film the whole thing in one go, without cuttin' to different shots.  So, most of 'em were only a minute or two long.\n\nBut hey, even though they were simple, these trick movies were pretty cool for their time. They were like the ancestors of all the fancy movies we got nowadays.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this dude John Taylor, he was a real go-getter back in the day. This guy was all about that farming life, and lemme tell ya, he wasn't afraid to speak his mind about how the government should be run. He thought farming was the best gig there was, and he wanted to make sure the government didn't mess it up. He was all about personal liberty, you know, doing what you want as long as you don't hurt nobody. \n\nThis Taylor dude thought the US had a golden chance to build a perfect system 'cause there weren't no old ways to get in the way. He believed folks should be free to do their own thing, and that the government shouldn't be bossing folks around. He thought if one right gets squashed, they all start to crumble, and nobody's really free.\n\nNow, Taylor, he was a firm believer in good and bad. He thought folks are naturally a mix of both, and the government had to be built to deal with that.  He thought a good government protects your stuff, helps farmers out, and keeps big businesses from gettin' too powerful. He believed a good government should be fair, even if the folks running it are lookin' out for themselves.  He thought everyone's got their own agenda, but that's okay as long as it doesn't hurt others. He figured a good government keeps things in check so folks don't get too greedy.\n\nTaylor, like a lot of his buddies back then, thought the Constitution should be read straight up, no fancy interpretations. He wanted the government to have just the powers listed in that document, 'cause he knew big government was a recipe for trouble.  But he also thought just reading the words wasn't enough; you gotta understand what the guys who wrote it meant. He even thought the Declaration of Independence was more important than the Constitution 'cause it talked about states bein' independent more clearly.",
            "So, like, check this out. We were trackin' these commuters, right? Figure 17 shows that, BAM! In the third month, people stopped fillin' out the forms. Kinda bummer, ya know? Dunno why it happened, but maybe winter hit hard and folks just weren't bikin' or walkin' as much. December is also when school gets crazy with finals and stuff, so maybe loggin' commutes just flew outta their minds. Plus, the holidays hit hard – everyone's gone, no campus, nothin'. Then January rolls around, school starts back up, but still, not many logs. February was especially weird, though.\n\nMaybe it's just that, like, new projects have a burst of energy at first, then kinda fizzle out. To fight that, we did this whole \"Carpool Challenge Week\" thing in March, and, boom! More logs! So, we had this problem of folks just losing interest, plus all the breaks and stuff.  \n\nAnother thing is that people, like, LOVE their cars. It's, like, in our culture. So, to get people to ditch the car, gotta give 'em something good. We threw out gift cards for restaurants, coffee, massages, even bookstores. But, I wonder if something bigger woulda worked, like, a sweet bike, a hybrid car, or even an electric one! Maybe that woulda kept things pumpin'.\n\nWe didn't change up the prizes much. If we upped the ante, though, maybe things woulda been different. Maybe if we started with gift cards and then, in December, announced a few bikes, and then, in January, a hybrid or electric car, more people woulda hopped on board.",
            "Yo, lemme break down this ETF thing for ya.  Think of it like this: it's like a stock that tracks a bunch of other stuff, like a whole bunch of companies or even somethin' crazy like gold.  It's kinda like a stock, but it's got more wiggle room.\n\nYou get the cool stuff from a regular stock, like buyin' just one share or even sellin' it short, but it's also spread out like a regular fund, so you don't put all your eggs in one basket.\n\nNow, here's the kicker: these things are cheaper than most funds.  But, there's a catch, ya gotta pay to buy and sell them, just like regular stocks.\n\nAnyway, there's tons of different ETFs out there, so you gotta figure out what's best for you.\n\nSo, let's take this one ETF, IHF, and see if it's really worth it.\n\nWe're gonna look at the top ten companies it's holdin' onto, 'cause those make up most of the ETF.\n\nWe wanna see if just buyin' those ten companies straight up would be better than buyin' the whole ETF.  \n\nWe're gonna compare their returns and how risky they are.  Turns out, just buyin' those top ten companies might actually give you more bang for your buck and less risk!  \n\nBut hold on a sec, maybe we just got lucky with these ten.  We gotta make sure it's not just a fluke.\n\nSo we're gonna check the spread of those companies, just to be sure.\n\nLet's see what we got!",
            "Okay, so get this, right?  This poem by Poe, \"Dream-Land,\" is supposed to be one of his best, but it's got this crazy thing going on with this word \"Thulé.\"  Turns out, Poe was a big fan of this German dude named Goethe, and he used the same word in one of his poems, \"The King of Thulé.\"  \n\nSee, in Poe's poem, Thulé is like this far-off island, kind of like the edge of the world.  And in Goethe's poem, it's about this king who's super messed up because his wife died. He's all gloomy and drinks himself silly, and eventually just takes his own life. \n\nSome folks say Poe was totally copying Goethe, but hey, even if he was, it's still a pretty cool connection, right? \n\nPoe even uses \"Thulé\" twice in this other poem, \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"  It's like he's obsessed with the place!  And you know what? Both poems are about this dark, lonely feeling, like you're surrounded by ghosts and everything's kinda gray.\n\nPoe might've been a bit of a goth, but he knew his stuff. He was buddies with Tennyson, who was also into Goethe, so it's no surprise Poe was too.",

Now, she's lookin' at this grocery store, D&D Markets, and thinkin', \"This ain't cool, you guys!\"\n\nShe's sayin', \"Yo, the store manager, this Martin dude, knew about the spill 'cause two of his employees told him about it.  He just brushed them off, said he was too busy eatin' his dinner to deal with it. And get this, he knew this was a problem 'cause people were slipin' and fallin' all the time! But he just didn't care!\"\n\nNow, in California, you can get extra money, called \"punitive damages,\" if you can prove the store acted real bad. Like, they knew what they were doin' and just didn't care about hurtin' people. Jennifer's sayin' Martin was totally in the wrong. He knew the spill was dangerous, but he didn't do nothin' about it.\n\nThink about it: two employees tell him about the spill, he doesn't care. Then, BAM! Jennifer goes down. It's like he didn't even care about her safety or anyone else's! That's seriously messed up, right?\n\nSo, Jennifer's lawyer is sayin' the judge should let her go after those extra damages 'cause Martin was totally in the wrong.

            "Man, lemme tell ya, back in the day, like almost four years ago, I took this Islam class at CBC. We were always going at it about whether Islam was this, like, scary religion or not. Feels even more real now than it did back then, ya know? I mean, look at the news since 9/11. First, it was all doom and gloom about Islam and these crazy extremists. Now? It's like everyone's suddenly best buddies with Muslims. I swear, back in '01, we'd never have had a prez-wannabe named Borac Obama, who's got family with, like, super obvious Muslim roots. \n\nThis Muhammad dude's story is wild. See, I thought he was this big-time conqueror, forcing people to become Muslims, you know?  But this biography paints him as this martyr, this misunderstood guy who was all humble and stuff. Everyone just kinda saw the light and flocked to him. It's like they're trying to make him look like some kinda Jesus-lite, but let me tell ya, it's kinda sus.\n\nAnd get this: there are some seriously crazy similarities between how Jesus and Muhammad supposedly worked their miracles. Like, Muhammad turning a little mutton and milk into a feast for forty dudes?  That's textbook Jesus stuff, dude!  They're practically stealing Jesus' thunder with all this \"humble prophet\" nonsense. It's like they're trying to make Muhammad look just as awesome as Jesus, but without the real deal.\n\nAnd then there are these stories about how people all converted to Islam on their own. But hold on a sec, a lot of them are just third-hand accounts, like \"So-and-so told me that his buddy heard from another guy who said...\"  It's like they're trying too hard to prove a point, but it just makes it all seem fishy.\n\nHonestly, what really bugs me is how they try to make Muhammad out to be this saintly, gentle, wise dude. But history says otherwise! He was a conqueror, a rough-around-the-edges kind of guy. Makes me wonder if Muslims today even know the real story behind their prophet.",
            "Okay, so lemme tell ya something about this whole Jesus thing. It's like, way back when, folks were all about his teachings, you know? But then things started changing. Christianity went in all sorts of directions, kinda like a runaway roller coaster,  getting further and further from the original path. \n\nNowadays, things are lookin' different. People are gettin' more open-minded, y'know,  thinkin' outside the box. There are still those who cling to the old ways, but they're not really makin' much waves. \n\nBut get this, in the future, folks are gonna start lookin' back. They're gonna wanna know what Jesus REALLY meant, separate from all the stuff that got added over time. It might take a while, years, maybe even centuries, but it's gonna happen.\n\nChristianity's gonna rewind, back to its roots, like a time machine. People are gonna ditch the extra stuff, layer by layer, until it's just pure Jesus, like it was back in the day.  \n\nIt'll start in the US and Europe, then spread like wildfire. People are gonna be worshipin' like it's Jesus' time again, just followin' his teachings.\n\nThe churches will still be there, leadin' the way, but things will be different. All the different groups, all the denominations, they'll start lookin' more alike than before. It'll be a big reunion, back to the basics.\n\nHistory's full of these big shifts, y'know? Like when the Romans were persecutin' Christians, and then BAM!  They became Christians themselves. Or how America went from slavery to Black leaders. \n\nThis big change comin' in Christianity, it's gonna be like that. It's gonna undo history, find the source, and bring everyone together.\n\nBut here's the thing: They're gonna have to see Jesus' words in a new way, kinda like metaphors, not just plain ol' facts.\n\nSo, what happened since Jesus' time?  Well, it all started with Judaism, that's the foundation, y'know?  They were all about one God,  holy books, and stuff like that.  But even then, they weren't all on the same page. They had different groups, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and a bunch of others.",

It's like, these big shot factory owners, they just wanna make bank, right? They don't give a hoot about the people workin' for 'em, or the environment. It's all about the bottom line.\n\nThis one part in the book, it talks about how these factories are like, massive things smokin' up the sky, spewin' out pollution everywhere. It's like they don't even care about the air we breathe or nothin'. And the places where they keep the animals, it's a total mess!  Just piles of crap everywhere. They don't care about the animals, either.\n\nAnd get this, these factory bosses, they treat their workers like garbage! They work 'em to the bone, no breaks, no nothin', and then bam! They just fire 'em without a second thought. Like they're just tools, ya know? There were no rules back then to protect workers, so these guys could get away with anything.\n\nThe workers were stuck in this crazy system, workin' themselves to death just to survive.

Scott Fitzgerald, that dude was a master. He throws these crazy adjective combos at ya, like words that don't usually hang out together. He also plays with symbols, like colors, to pump up the vibes.\n\nFitzgerald's obsessed with colors, man. Gold, green, white, gray, and red, he throws 'em all around. He gives 'em special meanings and then uses 'em to mess with your head about important stuff. \n\nTake white and gray, for instance. He builds up this whole thing about white being fancy and gray being faded and old. He drops these colors everywhere from the get-go. Daisy and Jordan, they're always decked out in white, like it's their uniform. Even Nick, he's rocking \"white flannels\" to Gatsby's wild parties. Tom's got his \"white shirt\" on when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine's all \"powdered milky white.\" It's like everyone's drowning in white.\n\nExcept at Gatsby's bash, where it's all \"gaudy with primary colors.\"  Fitzgerald keeps hammering these colors into your brain. Nick's work trip takes him down \"white chasms\" in New York.  Names at Gatsby's party become just \"gray names\" on his list. Even Catherine's apartment, it's just another \"slice in a long white cake\" of buildings. Straight-up uniformity.\n\nHe uses these colors for the regular folk too.  Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" together. There's \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the Valley of Ashes. The Italian kid on the railroad? \"Gray.\" Even the dog-seller's a \"gray old man.\"\n\nSo, once Fitzgerald's got you seeing white and gray as boring and ordinary, he uses them on Daisy. She suddenly pops up in \"white\" in a \"little white roadster.\"  It's like she's not even a real person anymore, just something Gatsby wants. \n\nHe keeps doing this to Daisy, like she's just a faded picture. \"Gray haze of Daisy's fur collar,\" \"white dress\" before Tom and Gatsby's showdown. It's like Fitzgerald's saying, \"Daisy? Nah, she's just another white, gray thing.\"",

They got tours, hiking trails, birdwatching, the whole shebang! It's like, you can help out the planet, grow some sweet food, and have a blast doing it!\n\nNow, growing organic stuff ain't always easy, ya know? It takes more work to keep those pesky bugs and weeds away without all the chemicals. Sometimes you lose more crops, and it can be tough to compete with those big, industrial farms. But hey, it's worth it for the planet, right?\n\nThere's this sweet spot near Potrero, a real gem. It's got all sorts of cool stuff: chaparral, grasslands, oak trees, the whole deal! It's right next to this huge forest, too! This land's been around for ages, used by Native Americans, then ranchers, and now it could be a haven for all kinds of wildlife!\n\nThere's a whole plan to protect all these endangered animals and plants, like the kangaroo rats, frogs, butterflies, and gnatcatchers.

See, culture, it ain't just some fancy word, it's like the air you breathe, it shapes how ya think, how ya talk, how ya even eat your tacos. Each group's got its own flavor, its own way of doin' things, and you gotta respect that.\n\nThinkin' all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are super chill? Nah, that's just plain wrong. It's like sayin' all cats are lazy just 'cause you met one who was snoozin' in a sunbeam.  Ya gotta dig deeper and figure out what makes that culture tick, how they see the world, 'cause that's gonna affect how they bargain.\n\nWhen you're dealin' with folks from a different world, ya gotta remember, you see things through your own lens, ya know?  It's like lookin' at a picture through a funhouse mirror, things are a bit warped. So, instead of judgin' or tryin' to change 'em, just accept 'em for who they are, like a weird but cool uncle at a family reunion.  And especially if you're the one with less muscle at the table, ya gotta play nice.\n\nCulture ain't just about countries, either. Even within a company, there's different vibes. Some places are all about grindin' 24/7, others are more laid-back.  You can tell by how folks dress, how they talk, even who gets the fancy corner office.\n\nValues, those are the real deal, they're the \"why\" behind a culture. If a place values respect and harmony, they ain't gonna pull any dirty tricks to win a deal. And if they're all about gettin' the best bang for their buck, they ain't gonna back down easy.\n\nSo, before you even show up to the negotiation, do your homework. Learn about the other side, their customs, their values, their quirks. And hey, maybe even find out what their favorite pizza topping is. You never know, a little common ground can go a long way.",

Seems like Thomas Aquinas, another brainy dude we're gonna check out, agrees with that.  \n\nNow, they both think God is real, but we gotta stick to the same God they're talkin' about - the one from the Bible. If we start messin' around with different Gods,  it's like comparing apples and oranges. We gotta see which argument for *this* God is stronger.\n\nLook, both Anselm and Aquinas make some good points, but neither one really lays out a totally rock-solid reason to believe in God.  \n\nLet's break down Anselm first. He says we can find God by lookin' inside ourselves. He's sayin' that because God exists in our minds, we can't even imagine him not bein' real. It's kinda like sayin' that because you know somethin' exists in your head, it must be real. He's sayin' faith is enough, we don't need proof. \n\nNow, Thomas Aquinas is all about logic and proof, no faith needed. He's got five big arguments for God, sayin' that lookin' at the world around us shows us God's gotta be there. He's like, \"Look at all this stuff, it couldn't just happen by chance, there's gotta be a reason!\"",
            "A long time ago, way back in the 500s BC, a prince was born who would later become known as Buddha. He decided to ditch all the fancy stuff of being a prince and became super wise. His teachings about life and stuff started something called Buddhism. There are lots of different types of Buddhism, but the oldest one is called Theravada. It's been around for more than 2,500 years, and it's changed a lot since Buddha's time.\n\nFor example, in Sri Lanka, a place where Theravada Buddhism is really big, they do this cool water-cutting ceremony every year. Monks and regular folks all join in, and it's pretty important to them even though Buddha never said anything about it. This shows how Buddhism has changed, from little things like ceremonies to really big ideas about what it means to be Buddhist.\n\nOver time, both monks and regular people who practice Theravada Buddhism have had to change how they understand the religion. This happened because of stuff happening inside and outside of Buddhism. Sometimes it was good stuff, sometimes it was bad. \n\nWe're gonna use some special words a lot: \"internal\" means something from inside Buddhism, like decisions made by Buddhist people, whether they're monks or not. \"External\" means something from outside Buddhism, like stuff from other religions or cultures. \"Hostile\" means something that wants to hurt Buddhism, and \"benign\" means something that doesn't care about helping or hurting Buddhism, but might end up doing one or the other by accident.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in finding peace and happiness by following the \"Triple Gem\": the Buddha himself, his teachings (called the Dhamma), and the community of Buddhists (called the Sangha). The Dhamma is like a big library of Buddhist writings. It has three main parts: the Suttas (Buddha's talks), the Vinaya (rules for monks), and the Abhidhamma (deep philosophical stuff).  \n\nA lot of Buddhist ideas are based on these things: Anatta (no permanent soul), Dukkha (life is full of suffering), and Anicca (everything is always changing). Buddhists believe that by understanding these things, they can escape the cycle of death and rebirth called Sansara. They also try to let go of desire, anger, and confusion (lobha, dosa, moha) so they can reach enlightenment. The Vinaya tells monks how to live their lives, with lots of rules for being good and ethical.  \n\nThe most important thing in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. The first is that life is full of suffering (Dukkha). The second is that suffering comes from clinging to things (attachment). The third is that suffering can end. The fourth is that there's a path to end suffering (The Eightfold Path).",
            "So, get this, America and Mexico, they had this huge beef going on for like, 57 years.  It all started back in 1836 and went on till 1893. These guys were always at each other's throats! The worst part was this thing called the Mexican-American War, where America basically jumped Mexico. They won, of course, and took Texas and a bunch of land in the Southwest. Talk about a power move!\n\nThere were tons of other skirmishes between them, but things finally cooled down right before World War I. You see, they just couldn't see eye to eye on stuff like religion, culture, and who got what. It's like when your siblings fight over the TV remote, but on a whole other level.\n\nThis whole thing reminds me of other neighborly feuds, ya know? Countries that share a border tend to butt heads over stuff. It's like, you're both trying to claim the same parking spot, only with countries and land. \n\nOne guy, David, said that America only really had major problems with Mexico and Cuba. These two countries, being right next door, were always causing trouble. Meanwhile, other Latin American countries were chillin' with the US.\n\nReligion was a big deal too. Back then, America was all about not being Catholic or monarchy, kinda like how they were against communism and fascism later on. It's all about what you believe, I guess.\n\nThis whole distrust thing went way back to the whole English and Spanish thing. They were never really cool with each other, so it spilled over into America and Mexico's relationship.\n\nThese two countries had a ton of disagreements, mostly about borders and stuff.  Bandits and outlaws would just cross back and forth, causing mayhem. Both sides had to put a stop to it with some serious muscle.\n\nEventually, things started to calm down because Mexico needed America's help, kinda like relying on a sibling for homework. And then, America shifted from wanting more land to wanting to control Mexico's economy.  That was the end of the big rivalry.",
            "Fifteen years ago, bam! Life threw me a curveball. I got hit with this sickness outta nowhere, one I'd never even heard of. Talk about a shocker! I was a nurse back then,  a job I picked for the safety and security I craved ever since I was a kid. \"You can always find work as a nurse, people always get sick, right?\" That's what everyone told me growing up. So, even though my real dream was to be a scientist or maybe even a journalist, I ended up in scrubs. \n\nBut there I was, 46 years old, single, and out of a job, thanks to this mysterious illness. Fifteen years of relying on Social Security Disability later, and let me tell you, I'm down to my last dime.  I scrape by, but every day feels like a fight to keep my head above water. My security, my safety, my self-esteem – it's all shaky ground. Nothing feels certain anymore. But here's the thing: I wouldn't have made it this far without my family and a few good friends.  Believe me, when life throws a real curveball, you realize just how much you need others.\n\nLife's gonna throw curveballs, big and small, no matter how prepared you think you are. Sometimes, you just need a helping hand. I totally get the whole \"don't rely on big government\" thing.  Let's face it, the system's got more holes than a Swiss cheese. But instead of everyone hunkering down in their own fallout shelters,  wouldn't it be better if we started trusting each other again?  Learning to help each other out, to ask for help when we need it?\n\nSure, people talk about \"rugged individualism\" being what built this country. But the truth is, our ancestors didn't cross the Rockies alone. They relied on each other, on compassion, respect, and sharing what they had.\n\nSo, yeah, be prepared. I am. I've got my disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purification tablets, even duct tape for the windows. I've got flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and a whole pantry of canned goods. If you've got the space and the know-how, grow your own food, learn to can it.  A wood stove's a good idea too, unless you're living in an apartment.\n\nBut here's the real takeaway: get to know your neighbors. You never know when you'll need them.",
            "So, you're wondering how things like bugs and clams and stuff get so weird lookin', right? Like, why'd they evolve to look that way? And what stops 'em from just getting totally bonkers? Back in 1917, this guy D'Arcy Thompson was like, \"Man, we're just scratching the surface of figuring out how to describe even the simplest living thing with math.\" And, guess what? It's still kinda true today!\n\nBut hey, lately folks have been trying to use math to figure out how shells, those crazy coiled things, grow and change over time. Think of it like this: imagine a snail's shell is a tube that's constantly spinning around in a circle, like a super-slow tornado. Each twist of that tube is called a whorl, and they all spiral around a central point called the columella.\n\nWe can measure stuff like how big the whorls get and how fast they grow, and we can even use computers to make fake shells and see what's possible. We're using X-rays to get a good look at real shells, then we're plugging those measurements into this software called CerioShell. It's like building a digital toolbox for understanding how shells change over time.\n\nWe're combining all this with experiments and observations to try and understand how big changes happen in nature, like when a species evolves into something totally new. It's like solving a giant puzzle, piece by piece.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya about Indonesia's health scene, it's kinda messed up.  \n\nSee, for the last ten years, babies ain't been doin' so hot.  Sure, they're makin' progress on things like clean water and toilets, but when it comes to keepin' moms and kids healthy, they're way behind.  They gotta step it up if they wanna hit their goals by 2015. \n\nThey're sayin' that more babies are bein' born with a doctor or midwife around, which is cool, but a lot of those midwives ain't qualified for emergencies.  So, even though they got more folks around, it ain't actually makin' things safer for moms.   \n\nPlus, fewer kids are seein' doctors for tummy troubles, and they ain't trackin' how many folks are gettin' checkups after they have a baby.  That ain't a good sign.\n\nThey ain't doin' enough C-sections either, especially in the country.  In the city, it's 7%, but in the sticks, it's only 2%!  That means folks in the country ain't gettin' the same care. And the poor folks are havin' a real hard time gettin' to the doctor.  They can't afford it, ya know?\n\nSo, what's the deal?  Should they just focus on one specific problem or fix the whole health system?  Easy programs sound good, but they can suck the funding away from other important stuff.  Plus, you end up with a bunch of separate programs doin' the same thing, which is a headache and a waste of money.",
            "So, like, Victorian books are all about being super detailed and, like, obsessed with rich people, ya know?  But then there are these two books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" that are kinda different. They're still from that time period, but they're more mysterious and, like, kinda freaky, which is totally not what you'd expect.  It's kinda cool 'cause it makes the characters way more interesting. You get a better sense of what makes them tick, y'know?\n\nTake this crazy passage from \"Oliver Twist,\" for example: \n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n\n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nIt's like Oliver is having a totally messed-up dream, right? And these weird dreams and stuff are kinda common in both \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights.\" They help us understand what's going on inside the characters' heads, like what's hurting them and how they really feel about stuff.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" these weird experiences often show us Oliver's inner turmoil.  When he remembers getting shot, it's like he's reliving it all over again in a dream. It's super intense, and it shows how scared and helpless he feels. He's totally overwhelmed, and it's like he can't even control what's happening to him. It makes you wonder who's really in charge of his life, because it sure ain't him. This whole shooting thing is super depressing, like Oliver is just giving up, ya know?",
            "A couple years ago, lemme tell ya, I was workin' at this after-school thing, helpin' out little kids with their schoolwork. I was pretty good at English and readin', so that's what I mostly did. One lil' dude, Adrian, he was in third or fourth grade, I think, was really strugglin' with readin'. It was weird, like he knew some letters but others, forget about it! He spoke perfect English, mind you, but readin', it was a whole other story. He was Latino, I'm pretty sure, but that didn't seem to be the problem. We were stuck, until one day, Adrian's mom showed up. Now, she only spoke Spanish, and my Spanish was, well, let's just say it was more like broken Spanish. But somehow, we managed to talk. And then it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet that well! I don't know if it helped him much in the end, but I hope he's doin' better now.\n\nI tell you this story 'cause it shows how tricky things can be with the language barrier in schools, especially here in California.  It ain't always as obvious as you'd think. Even for kids who speak English perfectly, readin' it can still be a real pain.  We all know this problem exists, so what can we do about it?  \n\nFor Adrian, it was pretty simple: some extra help with English readin', focusin' on the alphabet and sounds. But for kids who barely speak English, it's a whole different ballgame. There ain't no one-size-fits-all solution. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these things alone are gonna fix it. You gotta use a mix of everything!\n\nFirst off, dual language programs are a great idea, not just for kids whose first language is Spanish, but for everyone.  Kids in those programs do better in school, you know? People get scared about it, thinkin' it's a waste of money and that most kids won't benefit. But that ain't true. If we made these programs the norm, not the exception, everyone would be better off. \n\nNow, how do we do that?  Do we make all teachers bilingual? That's a bit much, right?  But I think we should definitely have bilingual helpers, tutors, whatever you wanna call 'em.",
            "Mack's latest robot was a pink bunny with a drum. Pathetic, I tell ya!  Kicked it once, battery popped right out.  Meanwhile, downstairs, some dude got back from filming a marshmallow commercial.  Before he could even get in the door, another guy decked him into a wall.  I bet he left a nice imprint.  Later, Camo and Katt, against his will, somehow got the high score on DDR Max 2.  Oh, and Gage just called.  He's got his dad's Hulk DVD, apparently.  Already saw it in theaters, though.  Ugh, what was I saying?  Oh, right!\n\nMan, when I was a kid, everyone kept telling me there was somethin' bigger out there, somethin' I couldn't even imagine.  Some folks went to Sunday school, others to Temple, some even tried to find answers inside themselves.  Lotta people just took what their parents told 'em, no question asked.  But some of us, we said 'Nah, forget it!' There's nothin' out there but what I see in my own world.  We might start out valuing one thing, then bam!  Suddenly, we're all about somethin' else entirely.  Doesn't matter what path you choose, though.  We're all just trying to figure ourselves out, lookin' for some kinda light in the dark to guide us.  \n\nRemember when my old man told me his favorite bird was a cardinal?  We were sittin' on the porch, rain beatin' down on that tin roof like crazy, both of us smokin' our cigarettes.  The gutters were overflowin', drownin' all the plants by the edge.  He was lookin' out at the rain, kinda lost in thought, like he was searchin' for somethin' or rememberin' somethin' else. He'd gotten thinner these past few months, clothes hangin' off him like a bad joke.  His hair was thinner too, not as full as I remembered.  He wouldn't look at me, just kept lookin' at that rain.  I felt all alone and scared, but couldn't bring myself to talk to him about missin' him.  Didn't wanna make it real for either of us.  So I just hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in starin' out at the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away in December that year, five days after my 22nd birthday.  Chemo and radiation kept him alive a few months longer than the doctors thought, but it didn't ease his pain.  I couldn't see the point of it all.  What kinda God would do that?  I didn't pray that night.  If there was a God, I thought, he stopped listenin' to me a long time ago.\n\nCouldn't bear to watch him go, so I didn't.  Couldn't watch the life that made me end.  I wanted to remember him how he lived, not how he died.  Besides, I knew my dad better than anyone else, even his own family.  He wouldn't want me to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in bed for three days straight, waitin' for the news.\n\nNo one even bothered to call.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this thing called the \"Gothic Novel.\" It's kinda like an oxymoron, ya know? Like, it's both old and new at the same time. This dude Ian Watt, he said that in his book, \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\"\n\nPeople have been talkin' 'bout Gothic novels for ages, sayin' they're either crap or masterpieces. Some say they ain't got no depth, others say they're full of this \"terrible sublime\" stuff.  \n\nSee, the first real Gothic novel was this thing called \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole. He mixed up old-school theater stuff with this newfangled \"nature writing\" thing goin' on at the time. He called it a \"Gothic Story,\" and it kinda blew everyone's minds. \n\nGothic novels are all about lookin' back at that old medieval stuff—the castles, the theaters, the whole vibe. Even back then, the word \"Gothic\" was kinda like a catch-all for anything ancient or, like, uncool compared to the shiny new stuff everyone was into. \n\nThe cool thing about Gothic is that it blends this dramatic, theatrical stuff with this new way of writing novels where you get inside the characters' heads, ya know? That's why it's stuck around for so long, even though it feels kinda outdated sometimes. \n\nOne big thing in Gothic novels is chivalry.  Back in the day, chivalry was all about trainin' up a proper knight, right?  Well, Gothic writers were obsessed with chivalry 'cause it represented this ideal: brave, honorable, the whole deal. They thought society had kinda lost sight of that.\n\nSo, in Gothic novels, they use chivalry to romanticize the past and try to make the present a little better. This guy Walpole, who wrote \"The Castle of Otranto,\" was livin' through some crazy political times. He was probably feelin' pretty down on the world and thought maybe folks back in the day were just better people. He uses chivalry to show that in his story.  \n\nTake this character, Frederic, for example. From the get-go, he's described as this perfect knight: a prince, tragic, probably gonna be a hero.  It's all very dramatic, kinda like a superhero but with swords and stuff.",
            "Alright, so picture this: you wanna get somethin', right? Like, somethin' super-duper awesome from the store.  Well, that's where the whole \"supply chain\" thing comes in. It's like a crazy, awesome rollercoaster ride for stuff, from the moment you say \"I want that!\" all the way to when it lands in your grubby little hands.\n\nThis whole idea came from this guy, Keith Oliver, back in '82. He was like, \"Hey, let's get organized! We gotta make sure peeps get what they want, fast and without any drama!\"  So he came up with this thing called \"supply chain management,\" which is basically like a super-secret recipe for makin' sure stuff gets where it needs to go.\n\nThere are six key ingredients in this recipe: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.  Think of it like buildin' a burger:  you gotta have the right ingredients, the right place to cook it, and a way to get it to the hungry customer!\n\nFirst up is production. That's where the magic happens!  We gotta figure out what peeps want, how much to make, where to make it, and who's gonna make it. It's like, \"Hey, customers love chocolate chip cookies, so let's bake a ton of those!\" Then we gotta figure out where to bake them, what ovens to use, and when to start bakin'.\n\nNext comes supply.  This is where we find the ingredients and the workers.  We gotta make sure we have enough flour, sugar, and chocolate chips, and that our bakers are ready to roll!  Sometimes, we even outsource stuff to other companies, like \"Hey, you guys make awesome sprinkles, can you send us a whole truckload?\"\n\nInventory is like the middleman. It's all about keeping track of how much stuff we have and making sure we don't run out of anything. We don't want anyone to be sad because we're all out of chocolate chips!\n\nLocation, location, location! This is where we decide where to bake those cookies, distribute them, and where customers can buy them.\n\nTransportation is how we get those cookies from the oven to the store. We gotta figure out the fastest, cheapest, and safest way to get those delicious treats to hungry hands.\n\nAnd finally, information is the glue that holds it all together. We gotta keep track of everything - what's being made, where it's going, and when it's arriving.",
            "So, check this out, right? This chick, Ellen Page, the one from Juno, is standing on the corner with a sign. It says, \"Hitler is alive in Burma!\"  Crazy, huh? \n\nNow, Burma, also known as Myanmar, is this place ruled by some seriously messed-up guys. They took over back in 1962, and things haven't been good ever since. A few years back, like 2007, some monks, wearing these saffron robes, started protesting. They called it the \"Saffron Revolution,\" get it? \n\nAt first, the government was all, \"Whatever, monks, chill out,\" but then things got outta hand.  People started joining in, and the government went totally bananas. They cracked down hard, beating monks, shutting down protests, and even locking up journalists. One guy, a photographer from Japan, got killed just for taking pictures! \n\nThey say 13 people died, but some folks in the know say it was way more. Like, thousands. This kinda stuff, it's not new. Governments have always tried to squash anyone who dares to speak up against them.  \n\nRemember the Romans? They thought they were gods, right? And the Japanese emperors? They're supposed to be gods too! And here in America, we got George W. Bush talking to Ted Haggard, the leader of, like, the dumbest people ever. \n\nThere's Tiananmen Square in China, where the government went all crazy on students and protesters. And then there's Rwanda, where they just murdered tons of people because of their ethnicity. And, of course, Hitler and the Holocaust.  \n\nIt's never ending, you know? This whole fight for freedom and justice, it's a constant struggle.",
            "Duke Ellington, man, he was a legend in the jazz world, ya know?  He stuck around forever, and that gave him tons of time to really make his orchestra his own. Sure, he wasn't always front and center on the piano in his tunes, but  this dude could write some seriously complex and cool stuff. \n\nHe knew how to make a song where a guy could go crazy and improvise, but he also knew how to make tight, orchestrated sections that really highlighted what each musician brought to the table.  Like, he'd craft these sounds that were totally unique and made each piece pop.  He was a master at getting the best out of every player, and that's how he made some of the most awesome jazz ever.\n\nThey even say in that big music book, The Grove Music Dictionary, that Ellington was all about using the voice as an instrument, check out his song \"Creole Love Call\" for that. He was using voices for texture and feeling without all that singing stuff. And in that song, he showed how he could make soloists shine, which he did all the time.\n\nIt's a slow blues song, twelve bars, six choruses, each one different. The first chorus is call and response between the voice and the reeds, smooth at first then kinda rough by the end. Chorus two, it's a muted trumpet solo that messes with the melody and throws in some of those bluesy notes. Then chorus three is all clarinet, high and sweet, with the piano adding a little somethin' somethin' underneath. Chorus four is the whole band echoing the first chorus, brass and reeds doin' the call and response thing. Chorus five, this is where it gets wild, the reeds are callin' and respondin' high up, with the brass and rhythm guys doin' this syncopated stop time thing. And the last chorus is back to the first call and response, but this time the voice gets all growl-ey, soloin' like an instrument itself.\n\nThen there's a little tag with the voice doin' some runs and the trombone endin' on this dissonant note, real weird.\n\nEllington used voice like that in a lot of his stuff, adding this extra layer of sound. \n\nHis song \"Hot and Bothered\" is another example of how good he was at orchestrating things and finding those cool sounds. He had \"Bubber\" Miley on trumpet and Baby Cox scatting, and their voices and instruments blended together so well. Then in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" he used Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton on trombone to start the melody, and it sounded killer.",
            "She'd always felt somethin' was missin'. It was like a hole in her soul, a yearning that just wouldn't quit. This emptiness started creepin' in around 14, right when she was hittin' that teenage groove. Three years later, at 17, it was still there, gnawin' at her. Now, she knew it wasn't some material thing she was after, it was somethin' more...someone. But guys? Forget about it. They'd try their cheesy pick-up lines and awkward dances, but nothin' ever clicked. She'd wrack her brain, tryin' to figure out why this was happenin' to her. Theories flew around, but nothin' stuck. So she just kept livin', always questionin', always searchin'.\n\nLife at home was usually chill. Her folks were good people, peaceful and calm. They rarely argued, and even when she tried to push their buttons, it usually ended in a good-natured debate. Her parents were the picture of serenity, but she, well, she was a whirlwind of energy and fun. It was a good mix, made her pretty darn likeable.\n\nBut today? Today was nothin' like usual. She was wanderin' around the house, lookin' for some spark of inspiration, when she heard a yelp from the kitchen. It was her mom's voice, short and sharp. She bolted into the room, panic settin' in, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?!\"  Her mom was sprawled on the floor, lookin' pale and in pain. \"Ow...sweetie...need...hospital,\" her mom gasped, each word a strained effort. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where to meet you,\" she said, her voice shaky but determined. Her mom pointed weakly, and the daughter, thank goodness for those self-defense classes, scooped her up and carried her to the car.\n\nThe hospital was a sensory overload - disinfectant, sick smells, and a palpable fear in the air. But she barely noticed. All her energy was focused on gettin' her mom help. She practically flew through the doors, barkin' for a doctor. Concerned faces swarmed around them, a gurney appeared, and they whisked her mom away.  She sat there, waitin', worry gnawin' at her insides.\n\nTurns out, her mom had been tryin' to reach a vase on a high shelf and took a tumble off the step stool.",
            "Listen up, folks! This study was all about how good that Mediterranean Diet (the Med diet) is for your ticker.  They found that the more you stick to it, the less likely you are to get heart problems or have a stroke.  This fancy \"aMed\" diet is like the Med diet's cooler cousin, with more plants, good fats, and fish, and less of the meaty stuff and bad fats. Think of it like a healthy power-up for your heart!\n\nThere's already been some talk about how the Med diet is good for you, but this study focused on strokes and heart attacks specifically. They followed all these nurses for like 20 years and asked them about what they ate. The nurses were awesome and kept track of their meals for years and years. They even double-checked everything with doctors and records to make sure they were getting it right.\n\nSo, what did they find? Well, the nurses who ate more like they were on vacation in Greece had way less heart problems and strokes. It's like magic, but it's actually science! The more they ate those healthy foods, the better protected they were.",

Like, everyone's outta work, houses are crashing harder than a video game rage quit, and all the big fancy companies are, like, totally toast. This whole mess is still hanging around, so we gotta figure out what went wrong, right?\n\nSo, get this, it all started with some politicians who were, let's just say, not thinking straight. They pushed banks and companies to give out these crazy loans to people who couldn't really afford 'em. It was like handing out candy to a bunch of sugar-crazed kids! And these loans, they weren't even good loans, they were like, \"sub-prime\" or whatever. \n\nMeanwhile, these two guys, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were supposed to be keeping things safe, but they got pressured into bundling up these bad loans into these even weirder things called CDOs and CDSs. It was like a financial game of Jenga, but instead of blocks, they were using people's houses!\n\nWhen folks started missing payments, BAM! The whole thing came crashing down. Banks ran outta cash, and everyone got dragged down with 'em. It was like a domino effect, except way scarier and with way more money involved. \n\nThis whole mess started way back in 1999, when President Clinton was trying to win another term. He wanted to look good, so he relaxed the rules on lending. That was like pouring gasoline on a fire, except the fire was the economy.\n\nSome smart guy named Steven Holmes even saw it coming back then. He wrote about how Fannie Mae was getting pressured to give out more loans, even though it was risky. He warned that it could lead to another big financial disaster, just like the one with the savings and loans back in the 80s. \n\nAnd guess what? He was right!  People started taking out loans they couldn't afford, and they got themselves caught up in all these complicated new types of mortgages. They were buying houses they couldn't really afford, and then they started building stuff on top of stuff, like a financial skyscraper made of wobbly blocks. It was insane!\n\nThen, BOOM! The bubble burst. All those houses that were worth way too much suddenly weren't worth anything. The banks lost tons of money, and some of the biggest companies in the world almost went bankrupt.\n\nIt was a total mess. And it's still affecting us today.",

(Don't confuse it with the other voice tempting you to spill every single detail about each character's childhood!)\n\nExposition means dumping a bunch of info on your audience, usually in plain, straightforward language. Think of those long winded scenes in movies where one character drones on and on, giving another character a history lesson, like some kind of real-life \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In writing, it's the author doing the heavy lifting of the telling.\n\nLet me give you an example. Imagine you're reading a story, and you're told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain place and time, they got hitched in a big fancy wedding, and then, bam! Her husband was murdered right in front of her eyes! Would you really want two whole pages dedicated to explaining all that, with the characters only getting two lines of dialogue each? \n\nNah, you'd expect the author to give us a taste of the husband's character, showing us through his words and actions how much he loved his wife. You'd also want to see how the heroine changed and grew because of him, through big gestures and little details.\n\nA good introduction to the husband would make you feel something for him, make you care about his fate. And when he's gone, you'd mourn with the heroine, connecting with her on a deeper level.\n\nIn short, you want substance, not just bare bones.\n\nThink of it like this: \"They met, they married, he died.\"  That's the bare minimum. As a writer, you need to give us the juicy details, the \"meat on the bones.\"\n\nSometimes we're tempted to rush past important stuff. Maybe you have a new character who was in the Air Force, now works the night shift at a gas station, has been married twice, no kids, loves fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the station someday, and just had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nGive us the good stuff!",
            "Mack, why are we even watching the news? This stuff is so boring! The first story was about some dude named Shad Hostettler stabbing his wife in Ashley, Ohio.  Did they even show her face? Nope! Just a picture of Shad lookin' all evil. They said he stabbed her a bunch of times, but that's about it. \n\nThen they talked about some kid, Travis Buyers, getting shot in Sharon Woods. Sounds pretty rough, but they barely said anything.  It's like they don't care 'cause he's black.  Remember that time a white kid went missing? The whole news was obsessed! \n\nNext up, some weirdo shot a hole in a Med-Flight helicopter with a .22! They were offering five grand for info on the shooter, so maybe someone will spill the beans.\n\nThey gave a quick rundown about the weather, sayin' it's gonna be hot and stormy on Saturday.  Typical.\n\nThen they talked about some dude robbing a UDF. They kept sayin' he was a \"dark-skinned black man\" wearing a hoodie. What's with all the emphasis on his race? Sounds like someone's trying to stir up some trouble.\n\nFinally, they had a story about this drug kingpin from Texas named Rene Rodriguez.  They kept saying \"300 months\" instead of 25 years, like that's supposed to sound scarier.  And they mentioned he was Hispanic, which had nothing to do with the story. \n\nThis news is so messed up, I'm outta here!",
            "Brothers, man, they're a crazy bunch. You know how it is, right? It's like, this unbreakable connection, like they're lookin' at each other in the mirror, but seein' even deeper, ya know?  They feel everything together, the good stuff and the bad. Love, pride, jealousy, even that nasty stuff like anger and cruelty - it's all there.\n\nThey get each other like nobody else, and sometimes it gets messy. It's like, when things get rough, that bond just shines through, like a crazy light show. But man, it comes with a price, ya know? You gotta deal with all those emotions, the good and the bad. \n\nSee, when you look your brother in the eye, you see yourself, but not how people see you, but like, the real you. It's all in your actions, what you do and the stuff that comes after. That's where you see your true colors, the real deal.\n\nThere's this story, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" about these two brothers, and they're goin' through all this, ya know? It's got this crazy landscape, like a jungle out there, and these two boys are on this trip that's not gonna end well. There's this fightin' going on inside of 'em, pride and disappointment, and it explodes in this big way. Only one brother makes it out alive. The story shows you how those feelings between brothers can be so intense, and the narrator, he's like, right there in the middle of it all, feelin' everything too. \n\nThe main guy in the story, he's all about pride, ya know? From the start, when he and his little brother, Doodle, go out, he's already got this resentment. He wants a brother who can do all this stuff with him, run races, climb trees, be his buddy. But Doodle's got this heart problem, so he's weak and can't do any of that. Imagine that, your dreams crushed right before your eyes! It's messed up. He even thinks about hurting Doodle, can you believe that? But then Doodle smiles at him, and he's like, \"Aw, forget it, I love this little guy.\"",
            "So, get this. Our brains, they're like, totally crazy complex, right? Kinda like trying to figure out a super complicated video game. Back in the day, people thought our brains were like wax tablets or papyrus – kinda like old school notepads. Then they were all, \"Nah, it's more like a book!\" But now, everyone's like, \"Dude, it's like a computer!\"\n\nBut hold up, these comparisons, they're kinda limited, you know? Like, they can get you thinking some crazy stuff.\n\nSee, all this info comes flooding in through our senses. Our eyes see light, our ears hear sounds, our skin feels stuff, and so on. It's all turned into these electrical signals – like, the language of our brain.\n\nAnd then the brain does this crazy thing. It processes this info, like, a million different ways. It starts with the basics – like, \"Hey, there's a black thing on a white thing.\" Then it's like, \"Wait, that black thing looks kinda like a box!\" It uses what it already knows to figure stuff out faster. Kinda like using cheats in a game, you know?\n\nBut here's the thing – our brains are picky. They only pay attention to the important stuff. Like, you see a ton of grass when you look down, but you don't notice every single blade. But if someone says your name in a crowded room, BAM, you hear it loud and clear.\n\nAnd then there's memory. Our brains are like, \"Ooh, gotta store that!\" There's short-term memory – like remembering your last pizza topping – and long-term memory – like remembering your first pet's name. They store stuff in different ways, kinda like different folders on a computer.\n\nBut how is all this knowledge organized? There are tons of theories about that, like, maybe it's like a giant web of connections, or maybe it's like a library with books on every topic.\n\nThe brain is seriously mind-blowing, man.",
            "Yo, check it! Aldous Huxley's book, \"Brave New World,\" is like, totally a warning about tech and money stuff runnin' wild.  He paints this messed-up future where everyone's all about being part of the crew and gettin' instant happiness, you know? It's like a big, messed up game where people are just pawns,  followin' the rules set by this dude, the World Controller. It's kinda like what Marx woulda said, you dig?  Huxley's got this lowkey suspicion about how these systems are gonna mess things up.  He uses words like \"homogeny\" and \"reification,\" which are like,  big Communist vibes, to show how messed up it is.\n\nBasically, Huxley's saying capitalism is a scam. They keep us blind to how the rich really get rich, 'cause we're all too busy chasin' our own little pleasures.  It's like brainwashing, man!  The World Controller's like the big boss, makin' everyone crave stuff they don't need.  He's got all the power, and the lower classes are just slaves to the system. They don't even know they're bein' controlled. They're like, \"Yeah, this is great! More stuff!\" \n\nAnd the relationships? Forget about it! There's no real connection between people. They're just empty shells, man.  Huxley's sayin' that technology and money are killin' our soul, makin' us shallow and heartless.  Love?  Emotions?  Nah, not in this world. It's all about lookin' good and havin' a good time, even if it's fake.  It's a total bummer, dude.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya, gettin' around this crazy place, University Park, is a real pain in the tailfeather! I've been here for like, two and a half years, four and a half semesters, and lemme tell ya, it's a jungle out there! My freshman year, they stuck me in East Halls, man, like, the farthest point east on campus.  Forget the stadium and that Bryce Jordan Center thing, they're still closer to civilization than that!\n\nSo, picture this: I gotta trek from my East Halls bunker all the way to Willard, which is like, smack dab in the middle of this campus, just to get to class. On foot, it'd take me 25 minutes, even longer if the weather decides to throw a tantrum, which, let's be real, it does all the time here in State College.\n\nI was talkin' to this dude, a grad not much older than myself, and he spilled the beans:  used to be, East Halls was like, surrounded by a freakin' desert, all empty land. Now? Boom! Sports fields, massive buildings, even a new Creamery and a fancy new health center! And apartments everywhere! This campus keeps growing, but getting around? Getting worse, dude.\n\nSo, what's the answer to this mobility mess? Bikes, man! Bikes are the key! But wait, it ain't just about the bike itself. Students gotta ride 'em, and the damn campus needs to play nice with us cyclists.\n\nI was hangin' out with my buddy, he got back on the bike after a few years off. Said he couldn't believe he ever stopped. \"Bikes are awesome,\" he said, \"it's like, the only way to get around.\" They're good for your body, too. Trust me, a bowl of oatmeal and a little pedal power, you'll be cruisin' 30 miles in no time.\n\nLike, most of the students here, I live off campus now. Just as far from the center as some dorms. Best decision I made this year? Bought a bike. Now I got class in Thomas building, a good 25-minute walk from my place. Bike? Five minutes flat if I'm feelin' speedy!\n\nBut here's the catch: Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas, but it ain't always a bike-friendly street, you know? Walkin' ain't bad, but I'm too busy for that. No bike, I'm stuck walkin' to class every day. That's like, 30-40 minutes each way, man! Over two and a half hours every week! Forget about it! That's time I don't got."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "Dude, lemme tell ya about my plans for the future! I'm all about helping out kids who've been through some rough stuff, like abuse or neglect. I wanna work with the Division of Family and Children Services, ya know, be a real hero for those little guys. And hey, I wanna help out families too, get 'em back on track and all that. \n\nI'm all about those core values, the good stuff: helping out, treating everyone with respect, being honest and ethical, and always working to make things better. Not just for other people, but for myself too. Gotta keep learning and growing, right?\n\nSee, I've always wanted to make a difference, but I wasn't sure how. In school, I saw a lot of people trying to escape their problems, some even using pretty messed-up ways to cope. It made me realize that I wanted to do something about it.\n\nSo I went for a Psychology degree, figured it would give me some tools. But after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, ya know, just to chill. One day, a friend introduced me to this kid, just sixteen, sitting like a scared puppy on her couch. Turns out, he was escaping his abusive parents.\n\nThe next day, I heard he called the cops! So I hopped over to his parents' place, just to see if I could help. I told the cops about my degree and my concerns. They asked me to talk to the parents, 'cause there wasn't much they could do.\n\nMan, those parents were shifty! They were nervous and blaming the kid for everything, calling him \"manipulative\" for reaching out for help. That's when I knew, I had to do something. I gotta help these kids, even if it's just to give them a voice. Social work, that's where I gotta be.\n\nAnd hey, it's not just about helping kids, it's about social justice too.  We talk about how important individuals are, but then we expect everyone to be the same.  I'm an individual, and I don't like being boxed in.\n\nThroughout high school and college, I fought for what's right: dyed my hair crazy colors, wore what I wanted, pierced my ears, joined that GSBA thing (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and stood up against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it.  \n\nI'm all about social justice, man. Always will be.",
            "Alright, so check this out!  We're gonna dive into the whole sleep thing, especially this thing called insomnia. There are these two main ways people look at why it happens – the \"it's all in your genes and your body\" way, and the \"it's all about your surroundings and who you hang with\" way. We're gonna check out some studies that back up each idea and see if they hold water.  \n\nSo, basically, sleep problems come in all shapes and sizes. You got your primary sleep messes, like insomnia (can't fall asleep!) or hypersomnia (can't stay awake!).  Then there are sleep problems caused by other mental stuff or even medical conditions.  And don't forget the wild ones - sleepwalking, nightmares, the whole shebang!\n\nWe're gonna focus on insomnia here, and how the \"it's in your genes\" crew and the \"it's all about your life\" crew explain it.\n\nThe \"it's in your genes\" people talk about how your brain is wired for sleep. There are these tiny parts in your brain called neurons that control when you're sleepy and when you're not. They're like little switches that flip back and forth. Scientists did an experiment with mice and found that these neurons have special receptors that can be turned on or off, and when they're turned off, it makes the mice sleepy! \n\nThis means that maybe, just maybe, some people are born with these receptors that don't work quite right, making it harder for them to fall asleep.  If that's the case, it's kinda like a built-in sleep problem. \n\nAnd the \"it's your life, man\" people say that your environment and experiences play a big role too. Where you live, who you hang out with, even your job – all that stuff can mess with your sleep.\n\nSo, who's right? Probably both! It's probably a mix of your genes and your life experiences that make insomnia happen.",
            "Alrighty, lemme tell ya about this thing called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, for short. It's like this: your ears work fine, you can hear everything loud and clear, but your brain kinda trips over the sounds. It's like trying to listen to a conversation in a crowded room where everyone's talkin' at once. You can hear all the words, but it's hard to make sense of it all. \n\nSo, how do ya know if someone's got CAPD? Well, look out for these red flags: they might have trouble tellin' where sounds are comin' from,  mixin' up similar sounds, or catchin' changes in tone, like when someone's bein' sarcastic.  They might also have a hard time followin' instructions or understandin' what people are sayin' when there's lots of background noise.\n\nNow, imagine you're a teacher and one of your students has CAPD. Don't worry, there are things you can do to help 'em out!  Make sure they sit near the front of the classroom, minimize distractions, and break down instructions into smaller, simpler steps. You can also use visual aids and give them extra time to process information. And hey, don't be afraid to ask for help from a speech-language pathologist or audiologist. They're the experts on this stuff!",
            "Alright, so this play, *Twelfth Night*, it's like,  saying that pretending to be someone else can work for a while, but eventually, you gotta be yourself or you'll lose yourself completely, ya know?  \n\nThe problem is, when you ditch the disguise, people might freak out! Some folks are cool with it, but others might get mad that you tricked 'em. So, you gotta choose: stay true to yourself or keep the peace with the peeps around ya.\n\nThis whole gender-bending thing makes it even trickier. Like, why do people even wanna hide who they are?  \n\nIn Viola's case, she's just trying to stay safe. She's in a new place, and pretending to be a dude is her way of protecting herself from creeps. It works, but it also keeps her from connecting with other women. Plus, it messes things up with Olivia and Orsino, who both kinda fall for her. \n\nIt's like, is Olivia into Viola because she thinks she's a guy, or does Olivia secretly like women?  Who knows! Maybe Shakespeare is just messing with us, showing how people can be shallow and judge based on looks.  It's kinda funny, but also kinda messed up.\n\nThe whole thing makes you think about how pretending can bring out hidden feelings. When Viola disguises herself, it forces Olivia and Orsino to confront their own stuff, even if they don't realize it. It's like a big ol' emotional rollercoaster!",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya 'bout this whole German invasion thing, 'cause it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Ya see, they were pretty rough on the folks in South West Africa (that's Namibia now), especially the Ovaherero and Nama people.  They, like, wiped 'em out!  Not cool, right?  \n\nNow, I ain't sayin' all the Germans were bad.  They had different ways of doin' things in different places, kinda like how my buddy Camo does things his own way.  Sometimes they even did good stuff, like teachin' folks in places like East Africa (Tanganyika).  When those Brits showed up in 1919, they were surprised to see so many smart Africans who knew how to read and write!  Even in Kamerun, they got praise for their schools.\n\nBut in South West Africa, it was a whole 'nother story.  No fancy state schools for the locals there.  It was all up to these missionary folks, who didn't get much help from the government.  They did spend a lot of dough on schools for the Europeans though, which ain't right!  This messed things up for a long time, even after the Germans packed up and left.  While other places had lots of educated Africans, South West Africa was left behind.\n\nSo why the difference?  Well, there's a bunch of reasons, and folks are still tryin' to figure it all out.  It's got to do with how the settlers felt about the local folks, and what the government wanted.  There are tons of books about this stuff, mostly written by Germans back in the day.  They mostly just described the schools, but some folks have been diggin' deeper, comparing different colonies and lookin' at what made them tick.  One guy named Cohen did a good job lookin' at South West Africa and East Africa, and he thinks the big settler population in South West Africa had a lot to do with the different education system.  He's probably right, 'cause South West Africa was pretty nice for Europeans compared to other places.  They had good weather and lots of room to spread out.  More folks wanted to move there, which changed everything.",
            "Man, trying to figure out what all the different kinds of music are these days, it's like trying to herd cats! I mean, you got your rock, your rap, your country, your jazz, your folk, and then each of those has like a million different flavours, right?  It's crazy! But outta all those styles, heavy metal, that's the one that's really exploded.  It's been around for about 40 years and it's gotten so big and wild, it's hard to even describe what it is anymore.\n\nSee, heavy metal is all about going big, ya know? It's got more energy, more noise, more attitude than most music. It's like they crank up the volume to eleven and just let loose. And these guys, they can really play their instruments!  It's not just loud, it's actually good. \n\nBut heavy metal is more than just noise.  It's got this dark side too, like it taps into some deep stuff.  Back when it first started, people were experimenting with drugs, like those crazy psychedelic ones. And that got mixed up with the music, making it sound weirder and wilder. \n\nHeavy metal is also like a big family, with lots of different branches. It's like a tree that keeps growing new branches and leaves.  It's borrowed stuff from other kinds of music too,  but it always stays true to its roots. To really understand heavy metal, you gotta see it as a whole movement, not just a bunch of songs.  It's a way of expressing yourself, a way of being loud and proud and not afraid to be different. And that's what makes it so cool.",
            "So, picture this: way before those wacky Surrealists were messing with our minds with their crazy paintings, there was this painter named Henri Rousseau, and he was busy crafting his own kinda dream world, both in his head and on his canvases. This painting, \"The Dream\" – it's from 1910, and man, talk about a mind-bender! This lady's totally blown away by the wild stuff she sees in her dream, right? But get this, it's not just about the dream, it's about Rousseau himself, his hopes and dreams as an artist.  See, this guy really wanted to be recognized, to have other artists and art fans all shout his praises. But here's the catch: he was stuck in this awkward spot – should he play it safe and copy the way everyone else was painting to get those fancy art world folks on his side, or should he just go his own way, paint his own crazy vision, even if it meant no one understood? \"The Dream,\" man, that painting is like his big question mark about that whole thing, his inner battle. \n\nYou gotta know a bit about Rousseau's story to get the full picture. He was born way back in 1844, in France. His dad was a pretty well-off hardware guy, but Rousseau never got any fancy art training. He actually worked for the government for years, dealing with tolls and stuff. He lost his first wife and most of his kids, which was a real blow. So, he decided to paint – it was like his escape hatch, a way to start fresh. And get this, unlike some other artists who painted romanticized versions of peasants, Rousseau was a regular guy, painting about the stuff that mattered to regular people.  \n\nRousseau really wanted to be accepted by the art world, and honestly, you can kinda see why. He was older when he started painting, didn't have any fancy education, and he was competing with all these other talented artists who were already famous. It was like trying to break into a club when everyone else already had VIP passes!  Some folks even say that Rousseau wanted his paintings to be so \"normal\" that people would think he was a real \"official\" artist, while Matisse was all about being unique and terrifying the art world with his wild stuff.",
            "A lotta brainy folks think beauty and right and wrong are, like, totally connected. Like, truth AND beauty, you know?  John Keats kinda said it best, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty – That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn a lot from books and stuff, but beauty and right and wrong, they kinda just hit you, ya know?  It's like we get 'em without someone teachin' us. Both beauty and  doing the right thing, they're more about explainin' why something's good or beautiful, rather than makin' rules about how to make it.\n\nThink about it. You can talk all day about why the Mona Lisa is awesome,  mentionin' foregrounds and shadows and stuff, but that don't really say WHY it's so cool. When someone asks about their favorite book or painting, they're gonna say something like, \"There's just something about it,\" before they even start talkin' 'bout the fancy stuff.\n\nArt and morals, they can't be fully explained, ya know? Like Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\"  Even if you describe a book perfectly, there's still somethin' extra, somethin' special, that you can't quite put your finger on.  And that's kinda how it is with morals too.  \n\nI think that's why art and morals are so close. We feel 'em deep down, in a way that's hard to explain.  And with books, it's even stronger. Literature makes us think about what's right and wrong, just like life does. We care about books 'cause they show us those values.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya 'bout Germany, see? This place is somethin' else!  It's strong, it's united, and it's got this crazy cool mix of culture, from the Alps in München all the way to the Baltic Sea in Kiel.  You go from Köln by the Rhine to Dresden on the Elbe, and you just KNOW this place is special.  It's got a history, you know what I mean?  A bunch of different tribes and stuff, all mixin' together to make what Germany is today.\n\nNow, they call this land \"Germania,\" which is kinda a mystery.  Some bloke named Tacitus, way back when, said it came from a tribe called the Tungrians.  They were tough guys, battled the Gauls, crossed the Rhine and all that.  Then there's Julius Caesar, famous for his Roman stuff, who used the word \"Germanus\" to talk 'bout these tribes he was fightin'.  He got it from the Gauls themselves, I guess, to tell 'em apart.  Some think it came from the spear they used, a \"ger,\" or maybe even from an old word for \"shoutin',\" 'cause those Germans were loud!\n\nThis other Roman guy, Tacitus, wrote a whole book about the Germans, sayin' they were the real deal, nothin' mixed in.  He even said, \"Who would leave Asia, Africa, or even Italy for Germany?  It's wild, the weather's bad, the people are grumpy!\"  Guess not many Romans were headin' there. They'd swing by for some goods or a little fight, but mostly they stayed in Rome.  Meanwhile, the Germanic tribes were livin' on the edges of the Roman Empire, sellin' stuff and even joinin' the Roman army.\n\nSo, that's Germany in a nutshell.  A mix of cultures, a history full of stories, and a bunch of tough people who built somethin' special.",
            "Alright, check this out. I'm lookin' at this mess, right? And my brain, it's just... blank. Like, I'm seein' it all, but I ain't really *thinkin* about it. Just like, processin' it, y'know?  Thoughts pop in and outta my head faster than a jackrabbit on a sugar rush.  It's like my mind's on autopilot, just observin', no big deal.\n\nFunny thing is, this reminds me of this art book I got, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  Always wanted to draw, ever since I was a kid.  This book, it breaks down how your brain sees stuff, how to turn a whole kitchen scene, with a bowl of fruit and all that jazz, into just that bowl of fruit, like a simple picture.\n\nBut right now, I can't do that. I'm too blown away! Picasso had his blue phase, Monet went crazy for greens, the Renaissance guys, they loved their rainbows.  If I'm gonna call myself an artist, well, this is my start, my story, my \"Work in Brown,\" get it?\n\nSo, I'm grabbin' my tool, my hand's twitchin', ready to create. Water's swirl  in' peaceful like, clean and clear. Tiny bits break off and float away.  Then my hand jerks, kinda panicky, like I'm scared of missin' somethin'. I slam the toilet handle again.  Nope. Stuck like glue.\n\nI'm standin' there, tie feelin' like a strangler, mop lookin' kinda pathetic in my hand. I gotta stare at this brown mess someone left, like it's a message for the bathroom cleaners.  Flush, think, flush.  Then I grab the toilet paper, wrap it around my hand like a giant oven mitt.

And they're not exactly experienced behind the wheel either. That's a recipe for disaster, man! They're crashing, rolling over, speeding, and driving off the road like it's nothin'.\n\nPlus, they always gotta have their friends in the car, you know how it is.  It's like they can't even drive without a party bus full of buddies.  These scientists did a study and found that the more young passengers, the more accidents.\n\nSo, some states are trying to keep things a little safer with these \"provisional licenses.\"  You know, those things that limit the hours you can drive and who can ride with you.  But, like, that's just a band-aid, man. The real problem is that teens just aren't ready for the heavy stuff.\n\nThis psychologist dude, Marvin Zuckerman, says even 18 is too young to get a license.  He says young people are all about that thrill, you know, pushing the limits just for the rush.  Maybe we should chill on the driving thing until they're a little older, when they've calmed down a bit.\n\nThink about it:  by 2010, a whole bunch of baby boomers' kids will be hitting the road.  We're gonna have a major teen driver explosion, and it's gonna be a mess if we don't do something.\n\nWe gotta make a change.  Schools can still teach driver's ed, but no one under 18 should be behind the wheel.  We could still have those provisional permits and all that, but the focus needs to shift to safety, man.

            "So, I was lookin' through some old Edison movies at the Library of Congress, see?  There were like fifteen of these \"trick\" movies from  back in the day, between 1895 and 1901. Ya know, the ones that use fancy cuttin' and stuff to make ya think things are happenin' that ain't.\n\nI mostly wanted to figure out how these trick movies worked, ya know? Like, what made 'em tick? I looked at most of 'em and saw they were pretty much the same way.  They used these set things, like a stage, and the camera just sat there, not movin' an inch. No zoomin', no fancy stuff like that.  They'd just film everything in one long shot, like they were  puttin' on a show.\n\nAnd speaking of shows, these trick movies were pretty much like vaudeville acts.  The guys in 'em would  dance around and make things disappear and reappear, like magic. But there wasn't much story to 'em, just a bunch of quick tricks. \n\nOne thing that really stuck out was how they filmed 'em. They always used these big, wide shots, like you're lookin' at a whole stage.  No close-ups, nothin' like that.  And the actors, they never came closer to the camera than the middle of the stage.\n\nAnother thing is, each trick movie was like one long take, ya know? Like, they'd film the whole thing in one go, without cuttin' to different shots.  So, most of 'em were only a minute or two long.\n\nBut hey, even though they were simple, these trick movies were pretty cool for their time. They were like the ancestors of all the fancy movies we got nowadays.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this dude John Taylor, he was a real go-getter back in the day. This guy was all about that farming life, and lemme tell ya, he wasn't afraid to speak his mind about how the government should be run. He thought farming was the best gig there was, and he wanted to make sure the government didn't mess it up. He was all about personal liberty, you know, doing what you want as long as you don't hurt nobody. \n\nThis Taylor dude thought the US had a golden chance to build a perfect system 'cause there weren't no old ways to get in the way. He believed folks should be free to do their own thing, and that the government shouldn't be bossing folks around. He thought if one right gets squashed, they all start to crumble, and nobody's really free.\n\nNow, Taylor, he was a firm believer in good and bad. He thought folks are naturally a mix of both, and the government had to be built to deal with that.  He thought a good government protects your stuff, helps farmers out, and keeps big businesses from gettin' too powerful. He believed a good government should be fair, even if the folks running it are lookin' out for themselves.  He thought everyone's got their own agenda, but that's okay as long as it doesn't hurt others. He figured a good government keeps things in check so folks don't get too greedy.\n\nTaylor, like a lot of his buddies back then, thought the Constitution should be read straight up, no fancy interpretations. He wanted the government to have just the powers listed in that document, 'cause he knew big government was a recipe for trouble.  But he also thought just reading the words wasn't enough; you gotta understand what the guys who wrote it meant. He even thought the Declaration of Independence was more important than the Constitution 'cause it talked about states bein' independent more clearly.",
            "So, like, check this out. We were trackin' these commuters, right? Figure 17 shows that, BAM! In the third month, people stopped fillin' out the forms. Kinda bummer, ya know? Dunno why it happened, but maybe winter hit hard and folks just weren't bikin' or walkin' as much. December is also when school gets crazy with finals and stuff, so maybe loggin' commutes just flew outta their minds. Plus, the holidays hit hard – everyone's gone, no campus, nothin'. Then January rolls around, school starts back up, but still, not many logs. February was especially weird, though.\n\nMaybe it's just that, like, new projects have a burst of energy at first, then kinda fizzle out. To fight that, we did this whole \"Carpool Challenge Week\" thing in March, and, boom! More logs! So, we had this problem of folks just losing interest, plus all the breaks and stuff.  \n\nAnother thing is that people, like, LOVE their cars. It's, like, in our culture. So, to get people to ditch the car, gotta give 'em something good. We threw out gift cards for restaurants, coffee, massages, even bookstores. But, I wonder if something bigger woulda worked, like, a sweet bike, a hybrid car, or even an electric one! Maybe that woulda kept things pumpin'.\n\nWe didn't change up the prizes much. If we upped the ante, though, maybe things woulda been different. Maybe if we started with gift cards and then, in December, announced a few bikes, and then, in January, a hybrid or electric car, more people woulda hopped on board.",
            "Yo, lemme break down this ETF thing for ya.  Think of it like this: it's like a stock that tracks a bunch of other stuff, like a whole bunch of companies or even somethin' crazy like gold.  It's kinda like a stock, but it's got more wiggle room.\n\nYou get the cool stuff from a regular stock, like buyin' just one share or even sellin' it short, but it's also spread out like a regular fund, so you don't put all your eggs in one basket.\n\nNow, here's the kicker: these things are cheaper than most funds.  But, there's a catch, ya gotta pay to buy and sell them, just like regular stocks.\n\nAnyway, there's tons of different ETFs out there, so you gotta figure out what's best for you.\n\nSo, let's take this one ETF, IHF, and see if it's really worth it.\n\nWe're gonna look at the top ten companies it's holdin' onto, 'cause those make up most of the ETF.\n\nWe wanna see if just buyin' those ten companies straight up would be better than buyin' the whole ETF.  \n\nWe're gonna compare their returns and how risky they are.  Turns out, just buyin' those top ten companies might actually give you more bang for your buck and less risk!  \n\nBut hold on a sec, maybe we just got lucky with these ten.  We gotta make sure it's not just a fluke.\n\nSo we're gonna check the spread of those companies, just to be sure.\n\nLet's see what we got!",
            "Okay, so get this, right?  This poem by Poe, \"Dream-Land,\" is supposed to be one of his best, but it's got this crazy thing going on with this word \"Thulé.\"  Turns out, Poe was a big fan of this German dude named Goethe, and he used the same word in one of his poems, \"The King of Thulé.\"  \n\nSee, in Poe's poem, Thulé is like this far-off island, kind of like the edge of the world.  And in Goethe's poem, it's about this king who's super messed up because his wife died. He's all gloomy and drinks himself silly, and eventually just takes his own life. \n\nSome folks say Poe was totally copying Goethe, but hey, even if he was, it's still a pretty cool connection, right? \n\nPoe even uses \"Thulé\" twice in this other poem, \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"  It's like he's obsessed with the place!  And you know what? Both poems are about this dark, lonely feeling, like you're surrounded by ghosts and everything's kinda gray.\n\nPoe might've been a bit of a goth, but he knew his stuff. He was buddies with Tennyson, who was also into Goethe, so it's no surprise Poe was too.",
            "So, picture this: Jennifer Palmer, she's chillin' in a grocery store, right? BAM! She slips on a puddle of applesauce, goes down hard, and hurts her back somethin' fierce. Now, she's lookin' at this grocery store, D&D Markets, and thinkin', \"This ain't cool, you guys!\"\n\nShe's sayin', \"Yo, the store manager, this Martin dude, knew about the spill 'cause two of his employees told him about it.  He just brushed them off, said he was too busy eatin' his dinner to deal with it. And get this, he knew this was a problem 'cause people were slipin' and fallin' all the time! But he just didn't care!\"\n\nNow, in California, you can get extra money, called \"punitive damages,\" if you can prove the store acted real bad. Like, they knew what they were doin' and just didn't care about hurtin' people. Jennifer's sayin' Martin was totally in the wrong. He knew the spill was dangerous, but he didn't do nothin' about it.\n\nThink about it: two employees tell him about the spill, he doesn't care. Then, BAM! Jennifer goes down. It's like he didn't even care about her safety or anyone else's! That's seriously messed up, right?\n\nSo, Jennifer's lawyer is sayin' the judge should let her go after those extra damages 'cause Martin was totally in the wrong. We'll see what the judge says, but it sounds like Jennifer's got a pretty good case!",
            "Man, lemme tell ya, back in the day, like almost four years ago, I took this Islam class at CBC. We were always going at it about whether Islam was this, like, scary religion or not. Feels even more real now than it did back then, ya know? I mean, look at the news since 9/11. First, it was all doom and gloom about Islam and these crazy extremists. Now? It's like everyone's suddenly best buddies with Muslims. I swear, back in '01, we'd never have had a prez-wannabe named Borac Obama, who's got family with, like, super obvious Muslim roots. \n\nThis Muhammad dude's story is wild. See, I thought he was this big-time conqueror, forcing people to become Muslims, you know?  But this biography paints him as this martyr, this misunderstood guy who was all humble and stuff. Everyone just kinda saw the light and flocked to him. It's like they're trying to make him look like some kinda Jesus-lite, but let me tell ya, it's kinda sus.\n\nAnd get this: there are some seriously crazy similarities between how Jesus and Muhammad supposedly worked their miracles. Like, Muhammad turning a little mutton and milk into a feast for forty dudes?  That's textbook Jesus stuff, dude!  They're practically stealing Jesus' thunder with all this \"humble prophet\" nonsense. It's like they're trying to make Muhammad look just as awesome as Jesus, but without the real deal.\n\nAnd then there are these stories about how people all converted to Islam on their own. But hold on a sec, a lot of them are just third-hand accounts, like \"So-and-so told me that his buddy heard from another guy who said...\"  It's like they're trying too hard to prove a point, but it just makes it all seem fishy.\n\nHonestly, what really bugs me is how they try to make Muhammad out to be this saintly, gentle, wise dude. But history says otherwise! He was a conqueror, a rough-around-the-edges kind of guy. Makes me wonder if Muslims today even know the real story behind their prophet.",
            "Okay, so lemme tell ya something about this whole Jesus thing. It's like, way back when, folks were all about his teachings, you know? But then things started changing. Christianity went in all sorts of directions, kinda like a runaway roller coaster,  getting further and further from the original path. \n\nNowadays, things are lookin' different. People are gettin' more open-minded, y'know,  thinkin' outside the box. There are still those who cling to the old ways, but they're not really makin' much waves. \n\nBut get this, in the future, folks are gonna start lookin' back. They're gonna wanna know what Jesus REALLY meant, separate from all the stuff that got added over time. It might take a while, years, maybe even centuries, but it's gonna happen.\n\nChristianity's gonna rewind, back to its roots, like a time machine. People are gonna ditch the extra stuff, layer by layer, until it's just pure Jesus, like it was back in the day.  \n\nIt'll start in the US and Europe, then spread like wildfire. People are gonna be worshipin' like it's Jesus' time again, just followin' his teachings.\n\nThe churches will still be there, leadin' the way, but things will be different. All the different groups, all the denominations, they'll start lookin' more alike than before. It'll be a big reunion, back to the basics.\n\nHistory's full of these big shifts, y'know? Like when the Romans were persecutin' Christians, and then BAM!  They became Christians themselves. Or how America went from slavery to Black leaders. \n\nThis big change comin' in Christianity, it's gonna be like that. It's gonna undo history, find the source, and bring everyone together.\n\nBut here's the thing: They're gonna have to see Jesus' words in a new way, kinda like metaphors, not just plain ol' facts.\n\nSo, what happened since Jesus' time?  Well, it all started with Judaism, that's the foundation, y'know?  They were all about one God,  holy books, and stuff like that.  But even then, they weren't all on the same page. They had different groups, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and a bunch of others.",
            "So, check it out. This book, *The Jungle*, it's all about how messed up humans can be, ya know? Deep down, they're all about lookin' out for number one, and they don't care about anyone else, especially not those less fortunate. It's like, these big shot factory owners, they just wanna make bank, right? They don't give a hoot about the people workin' for 'em, or the environment. It's all about the bottom line.\n\nThis one part in the book, it talks about how these factories are like, massive things smokin' up the sky, spewin' out pollution everywhere. It's like they don't even care about the air we breathe or nothin'. And the places where they keep the animals, it's a total mess!  Just piles of crap everywhere. They don't care about the animals, either.\n\nAnd get this, these factory bosses, they treat their workers like garbage! They work 'em to the bone, no breaks, no nothin', and then bam! They just fire 'em without a second thought. Like they're just tools, ya know? There were no rules back then to protect workers, so these guys could get away with anything.\n\nThe workers were stuck in this crazy system, workin' themselves to death just to survive. They were like slaves, man, with no way out. Even the unions were messed up, just takin' money from the people they were supposed to help. It's a total bummer, ya know?",
            "Yo, check it out! Writers be trippin' over different ways to make ya feel somethin' about their stories, ya know? Some methods are stronger than others. But F. Scott Fitzgerald, that dude was a master. He throws these crazy adjective combos at ya, like words that don't usually hang out together. He also plays with symbols, like colors, to pump up the vibes.\n\nFitzgerald's obsessed with colors, man. Gold, green, white, gray, and red, he throws 'em all around. He gives 'em special meanings and then uses 'em to mess with your head about important stuff. \n\nTake white and gray, for instance. He builds up this whole thing about white being fancy and gray being faded and old. He drops these colors everywhere from the get-go. Daisy and Jordan, they're always decked out in white, like it's their uniform. Even Nick, he's rocking \"white flannels\" to Gatsby's wild parties. Tom's got his \"white shirt\" on when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine's all \"powdered milky white.\" It's like everyone's drowning in white.\n\nExcept at Gatsby's bash, where it's all \"gaudy with primary colors.\"  Fitzgerald keeps hammering these colors into your brain. Nick's work trip takes him down \"white chasms\" in New York.  Names at Gatsby's party become just \"gray names\" on his list. Even Catherine's apartment, it's just another \"slice in a long white cake\" of buildings. Straight-up uniformity.\n\nHe uses these colors for the regular folk too.  Jordan and Daisy had a \"white girlhood\" together. There's \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the Valley of Ashes. The Italian kid on the railroad? \"Gray.\" Even the dog-seller's a \"gray old man.\"\n\nSo, once Fitzgerald's got you seeing white and gray as boring and ordinary, he uses them on Daisy. She suddenly pops up in \"white\" in a \"little white roadster.\"  It's like she's not even a real person anymore, just something Gatsby wants. \n\nHe keeps doing this to Daisy, like she's just a faded picture. \"Gray haze of Daisy's fur collar,\" \"white dress\" before Tom and Gatsby's showdown. It's like Fitzgerald's saying, \"Daisy? Nah, she's just another white, gray thing.\"",
            "Yo, check this out! So there's this totally awesome spot in San Diego County, right? It's like, super sunny and chill, perfect for growing all kinds of yummy stuff. They got tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and even peppers!  People there are all about organic food, man. They got these community gardens and stuff, but get this, the waiting lists are crazy long! People are wild for organic eggs and milk too! \n\nBut here's the kicker - these organic farms aren't just about the food, they're like mini-adventures! They got tours, hiking trails, birdwatching, the whole shebang! It's like, you can help out the planet, grow some sweet food, and have a blast doing it!\n\nNow, growing organic stuff ain't always easy, ya know? It takes more work to keep those pesky bugs and weeds away without all the chemicals. Sometimes you lose more crops, and it can be tough to compete with those big, industrial farms. But hey, it's worth it for the planet, right?\n\nThere's this sweet spot near Potrero, a real gem. It's got all sorts of cool stuff: chaparral, grasslands, oak trees, the whole deal! It's right next to this huge forest, too! This land's been around for ages, used by Native Americans, then ranchers, and now it could be a haven for all kinds of wildlife!\n\nThere's a whole plan to protect all these endangered animals and plants, like the kangaroo rats, frogs, butterflies, and gnatcatchers. It's a big deal! This piece of land could be a real game-changer, a place where you can grow food, help nature, and make some dough!  \n\nI found this real farm in the same area doing all this stuff, and it's inspiring, man! It's proof that you can do good and make a living at the same time.",
            "Alright, listen up, 'cause this is important for any time ya gotta make a deal with someone who ain't exactly from around the block. See, culture, it ain't just some fancy word, it's like the air you breathe, it shapes how ya think, how ya talk, how ya even eat your tacos. Each group's got its own flavor, its own way of doin' things, and you gotta respect that.\n\nThinkin' all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are super chill? Nah, that's just plain wrong. It's like sayin' all cats are lazy just 'cause you met one who was snoozin' in a sunbeam.  Ya gotta dig deeper and figure out what makes that culture tick, how they see the world, 'cause that's gonna affect how they bargain.\n\nWhen you're dealin' with folks from a different world, ya gotta remember, you see things through your own lens, ya know?  It's like lookin' at a picture through a funhouse mirror, things are a bit warped. So, instead of judgin' or tryin' to change 'em, just accept 'em for who they are, like a weird but cool uncle at a family reunion.  And especially if you're the one with less muscle at the table, ya gotta play nice.\n\nCulture ain't just about countries, either. Even within a company, there's different vibes. Some places are all about grindin' 24/7, others are more laid-back.  You can tell by how folks dress, how they talk, even who gets the fancy corner office.\n\nValues, those are the real deal, they're the \"why\" behind a culture. If a place values respect and harmony, they ain't gonna pull any dirty tricks to win a deal. And if they're all about gettin' the best bang for their buck, they ain't gonna back down easy.\n\nSo, before you even show up to the negotiation, do your homework. Learn about the other side, their customs, their values, their quirks. And hey, maybe even find out what their favorite pizza topping is. You never know, a little common ground can go a long way.",
            "\"A dumb dude once said, 'There ain't no God!'\" That's what Psalm 14 in the Bible says, and it's where St. Anselm starts talkin' about how God exists. Seems like Thomas Aquinas, another brainy dude we're gonna check out, agrees with that.  \n\nNow, they both think God is real, but we gotta stick to the same God they're talkin' about - the one from the Bible. If we start messin' around with different Gods,  it's like comparing apples and oranges. We gotta see which argument for *this* God is stronger.\n\nLook, both Anselm and Aquinas make some good points, but neither one really lays out a totally rock-solid reason to believe in God.  \n\nLet's break down Anselm first. He says we can find God by lookin' inside ourselves. He's sayin' that because God exists in our minds, we can't even imagine him not bein' real. It's kinda like sayin' that because you know somethin' exists in your head, it must be real. He's sayin' faith is enough, we don't need proof. \n\nNow, Thomas Aquinas is all about logic and proof, no faith needed. He's got five big arguments for God, sayin' that lookin' at the world around us shows us God's gotta be there. He's like, \"Look at all this stuff, it couldn't just happen by chance, there's gotta be a reason!\"",
            "A long time ago, way back in the 500s BC, a prince was born who would later become known as Buddha. He decided to ditch all the fancy stuff of being a prince and became super wise. His teachings about life and stuff started something called Buddhism. There are lots of different types of Buddhism, but the oldest one is called Theravada. It's been around for more than 2,500 years, and it's changed a lot since Buddha's time.\n\nFor example, in Sri Lanka, a place where Theravada Buddhism is really big, they do this cool water-cutting ceremony every year. Monks and regular folks all join in, and it's pretty important to them even though Buddha never said anything about it. This shows how Buddhism has changed, from little things like ceremonies to really big ideas about what it means to be Buddhist.\n\nOver time, both monks and regular people who practice Theravada Buddhism have had to change how they understand the religion. This happened because of stuff happening inside and outside of Buddhism. Sometimes it was good stuff, sometimes it was bad. \n\nWe're gonna use some special words a lot: \"internal\" means something from inside Buddhism, like decisions made by Buddhist people, whether they're monks or not. \"External\" means something from outside Buddhism, like stuff from other religions or cultures. \"Hostile\" means something that wants to hurt Buddhism, and \"benign\" means something that doesn't care about helping or hurting Buddhism, but might end up doing one or the other by accident.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in finding peace and happiness by following the \"Triple Gem\": the Buddha himself, his teachings (called the Dhamma), and the community of Buddhists (called the Sangha). The Dhamma is like a big library of Buddhist writings. It has three main parts: the Suttas (Buddha's talks), the Vinaya (rules for monks), and the Abhidhamma (deep philosophical stuff).  \n\nA lot of Buddhist ideas are based on these things: Anatta (no permanent soul), Dukkha (life is full of suffering), and Anicca (everything is always changing). Buddhists believe that by understanding these things, they can escape the cycle of death and rebirth called Sansara. They also try to let go of desire, anger, and confusion (lobha, dosa, moha) so they can reach enlightenment. The Vinaya tells monks how to live their lives, with lots of rules for being good and ethical.  \n\nThe most important thing in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. The first is that life is full of suffering (Dukkha). The second is that suffering comes from clinging to things (attachment). The third is that suffering can end. The fourth is that there's a path to end suffering (The Eightfold Path).",
            "So, get this, America and Mexico, they had this huge beef going on for like, 57 years.  It all started back in 1836 and went on till 1893. These guys were always at each other's throats! The worst part was this thing called the Mexican-American War, where America basically jumped Mexico. They won, of course, and took Texas and a bunch of land in the Southwest. Talk about a power move!\n\nThere were tons of other skirmishes between them, but things finally cooled down right before World War I. You see, they just couldn't see eye to eye on stuff like religion, culture, and who got what. It's like when your siblings fight over the TV remote, but on a whole other level.\n\nThis whole thing reminds me of other neighborly feuds, ya know? Countries that share a border tend to butt heads over stuff. It's like, you're both trying to claim the same parking spot, only with countries and land. \n\nOne guy, David, said that America only really had major problems with Mexico and Cuba. These two countries, being right next door, were always causing trouble. Meanwhile, other Latin American countries were chillin' with the US.\n\nReligion was a big deal too. Back then, America was all about not being Catholic or monarchy, kinda like how they were against communism and fascism later on. It's all about what you believe, I guess.\n\nThis whole distrust thing went way back to the whole English and Spanish thing. They were never really cool with each other, so it spilled over into America and Mexico's relationship.\n\nThese two countries had a ton of disagreements, mostly about borders and stuff.  Bandits and outlaws would just cross back and forth, causing mayhem. Both sides had to put a stop to it with some serious muscle.\n\nEventually, things started to calm down because Mexico needed America's help, kinda like relying on a sibling for homework. And then, America shifted from wanting more land to wanting to control Mexico's economy.  That was the end of the big rivalry.",
            "Fifteen years ago, bam! Life threw me a curveball. I got hit with this sickness outta nowhere, one I'd never even heard of. Talk about a shocker! I was a nurse back then,  a job I picked for the safety and security I craved ever since I was a kid. \"You can always find work as a nurse, people always get sick, right?\" That's what everyone told me growing up. So, even though my real dream was to be a scientist or maybe even a journalist, I ended up in scrubs. \n\nBut there I was, 46 years old, single, and out of a job, thanks to this mysterious illness. Fifteen years of relying on Social Security Disability later, and let me tell you, I'm down to my last dime.  I scrape by, but every day feels like a fight to keep my head above water. My security, my safety, my self-esteem – it's all shaky ground. Nothing feels certain anymore. But here's the thing: I wouldn't have made it this far without my family and a few good friends.  Believe me, when life throws a real curveball, you realize just how much you need others.\n\nLife's gonna throw curveballs, big and small, no matter how prepared you think you are. Sometimes, you just need a helping hand. I totally get the whole \"don't rely on big government\" thing.  Let's face it, the system's got more holes than a Swiss cheese. But instead of everyone hunkering down in their own fallout shelters,  wouldn't it be better if we started trusting each other again?  Learning to help each other out, to ask for help when we need it?\n\nSure, people talk about \"rugged individualism\" being what built this country. But the truth is, our ancestors didn't cross the Rockies alone. They relied on each other, on compassion, respect, and sharing what they had.\n\nSo, yeah, be prepared. I am. I've got my disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purification tablets, even duct tape for the windows. I've got flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and a whole pantry of canned goods. If you've got the space and the know-how, grow your own food, learn to can it.  A wood stove's a good idea too, unless you're living in an apartment.\n\nBut here's the real takeaway: get to know your neighbors. You never know when you'll need them.",
            "So, you're wondering how things like bugs and clams and stuff get so weird lookin', right? Like, why'd they evolve to look that way? And what stops 'em from just getting totally bonkers? Back in 1917, this guy D'Arcy Thompson was like, \"Man, we're just scratching the surface of figuring out how to describe even the simplest living thing with math.\" And, guess what? It's still kinda true today!\n\nBut hey, lately folks have been trying to use math to figure out how shells, those crazy coiled things, grow and change over time. Think of it like this: imagine a snail's shell is a tube that's constantly spinning around in a circle, like a super-slow tornado. Each twist of that tube is called a whorl, and they all spiral around a central point called the columella.\n\nWe can measure stuff like how big the whorls get and how fast they grow, and we can even use computers to make fake shells and see what's possible. We're using X-rays to get a good look at real shells, then we're plugging those measurements into this software called CerioShell. It's like building a digital toolbox for understanding how shells change over time.\n\nWe're combining all this with experiments and observations to try and understand how big changes happen in nature, like when a species evolves into something totally new. It's like solving a giant puzzle, piece by piece.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya about Indonesia's health scene, it's kinda messed up.  \n\nSee, for the last ten years, babies ain't been doin' so hot.  Sure, they're makin' progress on things like clean water and toilets, but when it comes to keepin' moms and kids healthy, they're way behind.  They gotta step it up if they wanna hit their goals by 2015. \n\nThey're sayin' that more babies are bein' born with a doctor or midwife around, which is cool, but a lot of those midwives ain't qualified for emergencies.  So, even though they got more folks around, it ain't actually makin' things safer for moms.   \n\nPlus, fewer kids are seein' doctors for tummy troubles, and they ain't trackin' how many folks are gettin' checkups after they have a baby.  That ain't a good sign.\n\nThey ain't doin' enough C-sections either, especially in the country.  In the city, it's 7%, but in the sticks, it's only 2%!  That means folks in the country ain't gettin' the same care. And the poor folks are havin' a real hard time gettin' to the doctor.  They can't afford it, ya know?\n\nSo, what's the deal?  Should they just focus on one specific problem or fix the whole health system?  Easy programs sound good, but they can suck the funding away from other important stuff.  Plus, you end up with a bunch of separate programs doin' the same thing, which is a headache and a waste of money.",
            "So, like, Victorian books are all about being super detailed and, like, obsessed with rich people, ya know?  But then there are these two books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" that are kinda different. They're still from that time period, but they're more mysterious and, like, kinda freaky, which is totally not what you'd expect.  It's kinda cool 'cause it makes the characters way more interesting. You get a better sense of what makes them tick, y'know?\n\nTake this crazy passage from \"Oliver Twist,\" for example: \n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n\n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nIt's like Oliver is having a totally messed-up dream, right? And these weird dreams and stuff are kinda common in both \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights.\" They help us understand what's going on inside the characters' heads, like what's hurting them and how they really feel about stuff.\n\nIn \"Oliver Twist,\" these weird experiences often show us Oliver's inner turmoil.  When he remembers getting shot, it's like he's reliving it all over again in a dream. It's super intense, and it shows how scared and helpless he feels. He's totally overwhelmed, and it's like he can't even control what's happening to him. It makes you wonder who's really in charge of his life, because it sure ain't him. This whole shooting thing is super depressing, like Oliver is just giving up, ya know?",
            "A couple years ago, lemme tell ya, I was workin' at this after-school thing, helpin' out little kids with their schoolwork. I was pretty good at English and readin', so that's what I mostly did. One lil' dude, Adrian, he was in third or fourth grade, I think, was really strugglin' with readin'. It was weird, like he knew some letters but others, forget about it! He spoke perfect English, mind you, but readin', it was a whole other story. He was Latino, I'm pretty sure, but that didn't seem to be the problem. We were stuck, until one day, Adrian's mom showed up. Now, she only spoke Spanish, and my Spanish was, well, let's just say it was more like broken Spanish. But somehow, we managed to talk. And then it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet that well! I don't know if it helped him much in the end, but I hope he's doin' better now.\n\nI tell you this story 'cause it shows how tricky things can be with the language barrier in schools, especially here in California.  It ain't always as obvious as you'd think. Even for kids who speak English perfectly, readin' it can still be a real pain.  We all know this problem exists, so what can we do about it?  \n\nFor Adrian, it was pretty simple: some extra help with English readin', focusin' on the alphabet and sounds. But for kids who barely speak English, it's a whole different ballgame. There ain't no one-size-fits-all solution. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these things alone are gonna fix it. You gotta use a mix of everything!\n\nFirst off, dual language programs are a great idea, not just for kids whose first language is Spanish, but for everyone.  Kids in those programs do better in school, you know? People get scared about it, thinkin' it's a waste of money and that most kids won't benefit. But that ain't true. If we made these programs the norm, not the exception, everyone would be better off. \n\nNow, how do we do that?  Do we make all teachers bilingual? That's a bit much, right?  But I think we should definitely have bilingual helpers, tutors, whatever you wanna call 'em.",
            "Mack's latest robot was a pink bunny with a drum. Pathetic, I tell ya!  Kicked it once, battery popped right out.  Meanwhile, downstairs, some dude got back from filming a marshmallow commercial.  Before he could even get in the door, another guy decked him into a wall.  I bet he left a nice imprint.  Later, Camo and Katt, against his will, somehow got the high score on DDR Max 2.  Oh, and Gage just called.  He's got his dad's Hulk DVD, apparently.  Already saw it in theaters, though.  Ugh, what was I saying?  Oh, right!\n\nMan, when I was a kid, everyone kept telling me there was somethin' bigger out there, somethin' I couldn't even imagine.  Some folks went to Sunday school, others to Temple, some even tried to find answers inside themselves.  Lotta people just took what their parents told 'em, no question asked.  But some of us, we said 'Nah, forget it!' There's nothin' out there but what I see in my own world.  We might start out valuing one thing, then bam!  Suddenly, we're all about somethin' else entirely.  Doesn't matter what path you choose, though.  We're all just trying to figure ourselves out, lookin' for some kinda light in the dark to guide us.  \n\nRemember when my old man told me his favorite bird was a cardinal?  We were sittin' on the porch, rain beatin' down on that tin roof like crazy, both of us smokin' our cigarettes.  The gutters were overflowin', drownin' all the plants by the edge.  He was lookin' out at the rain, kinda lost in thought, like he was searchin' for somethin' or rememberin' somethin' else. He'd gotten thinner these past few months, clothes hangin' off him like a bad joke.  His hair was thinner too, not as full as I remembered.  He wouldn't look at me, just kept lookin' at that rain.  I felt all alone and scared, but couldn't bring myself to talk to him about missin' him.  Didn't wanna make it real for either of us.  So I just hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in starin' out at the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away in December that year, five days after my 22nd birthday.  Chemo and radiation kept him alive a few months longer than the doctors thought, but it didn't ease his pain.  I couldn't see the point of it all.  What kinda God would do that?  I didn't pray that night.  If there was a God, I thought, he stopped listenin' to me a long time ago.\n\nCouldn't bear to watch him go, so I didn't.  Couldn't watch the life that made me end.  I wanted to remember him how he lived, not how he died.  Besides, I knew my dad better than anyone else, even his own family.  He wouldn't want me to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in bed for three days straight, waitin' for the news.\n\nNo one even bothered to call.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this thing called the \"Gothic Novel.\" It's kinda like an oxymoron, ya know? Like, it's both old and new at the same time. This dude Ian Watt, he said that in his book, \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\"\n\nPeople have been talkin' 'bout Gothic novels for ages, sayin' they're either crap or masterpieces. Some say they ain't got no depth, others say they're full of this \"terrible sublime\" stuff.  \n\nSee, the first real Gothic novel was this thing called \"The Castle of Otranto\" by Horace Walpole. He mixed up old-school theater stuff with this newfangled \"nature writing\" thing goin' on at the time. He called it a \"Gothic Story,\" and it kinda blew everyone's minds. \n\nGothic novels are all about lookin' back at that old medieval stuff—the castles, the theaters, the whole vibe. Even back then, the word \"Gothic\" was kinda like a catch-all for anything ancient or, like, uncool compared to the shiny new stuff everyone was into. \n\nThe cool thing about Gothic is that it blends this dramatic, theatrical stuff with this new way of writing novels where you get inside the characters' heads, ya know? That's why it's stuck around for so long, even though it feels kinda outdated sometimes. \n\nOne big thing in Gothic novels is chivalry.  Back in the day, chivalry was all about trainin' up a proper knight, right?  Well, Gothic writers were obsessed with chivalry 'cause it represented this ideal: brave, honorable, the whole deal. They thought society had kinda lost sight of that.\n\nSo, in Gothic novels, they use chivalry to romanticize the past and try to make the present a little better. This guy Walpole, who wrote \"The Castle of Otranto,\" was livin' through some crazy political times. He was probably feelin' pretty down on the world and thought maybe folks back in the day were just better people. He uses chivalry to show that in his story.  \n\nTake this character, Frederic, for example. From the get-go, he's described as this perfect knight: a prince, tragic, probably gonna be a hero.  It's all very dramatic, kinda like a superhero but with swords and stuff.",
            "Alright, so picture this: you wanna get somethin', right? Like, somethin' super-duper awesome from the store.  Well, that's where the whole \"supply chain\" thing comes in. It's like a crazy, awesome rollercoaster ride for stuff, from the moment you say \"I want that!\" all the way to when it lands in your grubby little hands.\n\nThis whole idea came from this guy, Keith Oliver, back in '82. He was like, \"Hey, let's get organized! We gotta make sure peeps get what they want, fast and without any drama!\"  So he came up with this thing called \"supply chain management,\" which is basically like a super-secret recipe for makin' sure stuff gets where it needs to go.\n\nThere are six key ingredients in this recipe: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.  Think of it like buildin' a burger:  you gotta have the right ingredients, the right place to cook it, and a way to get it to the hungry customer!\n\nFirst up is production. That's where the magic happens!  We gotta figure out what peeps want, how much to make, where to make it, and who's gonna make it. It's like, \"Hey, customers love chocolate chip cookies, so let's bake a ton of those!\" Then we gotta figure out where to bake them, what ovens to use, and when to start bakin'.\n\nNext comes supply.  This is where we find the ingredients and the workers.  We gotta make sure we have enough flour, sugar, and chocolate chips, and that our bakers are ready to roll!  Sometimes, we even outsource stuff to other companies, like \"Hey, you guys make awesome sprinkles, can you send us a whole truckload?\"\n\nInventory is like the middleman. It's all about keeping track of how much stuff we have and making sure we don't run out of anything. We don't want anyone to be sad because we're all out of chocolate chips!\n\nLocation, location, location! This is where we decide where to bake those cookies, distribute them, and where customers can buy them.\n\nTransportation is how we get those cookies from the oven to the store. We gotta figure out the fastest, cheapest, and safest way to get those delicious treats to hungry hands.\n\nAnd finally, information is the glue that holds it all together. We gotta keep track of everything - what's being made, where it's going, and when it's arriving.",
            "So, check this out, right? This chick, Ellen Page, the one from Juno, is standing on the corner with a sign. It says, \"Hitler is alive in Burma!\"  Crazy, huh? \n\nNow, Burma, also known as Myanmar, is this place ruled by some seriously messed-up guys. They took over back in 1962, and things haven't been good ever since. A few years back, like 2007, some monks, wearing these saffron robes, started protesting. They called it the \"Saffron Revolution,\" get it? \n\nAt first, the government was all, \"Whatever, monks, chill out,\" but then things got outta hand.  People started joining in, and the government went totally bananas. They cracked down hard, beating monks, shutting down protests, and even locking up journalists. One guy, a photographer from Japan, got killed just for taking pictures! \n\nThey say 13 people died, but some folks in the know say it was way more. Like, thousands. This kinda stuff, it's not new. Governments have always tried to squash anyone who dares to speak up against them.  \n\nRemember the Romans? They thought they were gods, right? And the Japanese emperors? They're supposed to be gods too! And here in America, we got George W. Bush talking to Ted Haggard, the leader of, like, the dumbest people ever. \n\nThere's Tiananmen Square in China, where the government went all crazy on students and protesters. And then there's Rwanda, where they just murdered tons of people because of their ethnicity. And, of course, Hitler and the Holocaust.  \n\nIt's never ending, you know? This whole fight for freedom and justice, it's a constant struggle.",
            "Duke Ellington, man, he was a legend in the jazz world, ya know?  He stuck around forever, and that gave him tons of time to really make his orchestra his own. Sure, he wasn't always front and center on the piano in his tunes, but  this dude could write some seriously complex and cool stuff. \n\nHe knew how to make a song where a guy could go crazy and improvise, but he also knew how to make tight, orchestrated sections that really highlighted what each musician brought to the table.  Like, he'd craft these sounds that were totally unique and made each piece pop.  He was a master at getting the best out of every player, and that's how he made some of the most awesome jazz ever.\n\nThey even say in that big music book, The Grove Music Dictionary, that Ellington was all about using the voice as an instrument, check out his song \"Creole Love Call\" for that. He was using voices for texture and feeling without all that singing stuff. And in that song, he showed how he could make soloists shine, which he did all the time.\n\nIt's a slow blues song, twelve bars, six choruses, each one different. The first chorus is call and response between the voice and the reeds, smooth at first then kinda rough by the end. Chorus two, it's a muted trumpet solo that messes with the melody and throws in some of those bluesy notes. Then chorus three is all clarinet, high and sweet, with the piano adding a little somethin' somethin' underneath. Chorus four is the whole band echoing the first chorus, brass and reeds doin' the call and response thing. Chorus five, this is where it gets wild, the reeds are callin' and respondin' high up, with the brass and rhythm guys doin' this syncopated stop time thing. And the last chorus is back to the first call and response, but this time the voice gets all growl-ey, soloin' like an instrument itself.\n\nThen there's a little tag with the voice doin' some runs and the trombone endin' on this dissonant note, real weird.\n\nEllington used voice like that in a lot of his stuff, adding this extra layer of sound. \n\nHis song \"Hot and Bothered\" is another example of how good he was at orchestrating things and finding those cool sounds. He had \"Bubber\" Miley on trumpet and Baby Cox scatting, and their voices and instruments blended together so well. Then in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" he used Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton on trombone to start the melody, and it sounded killer.",
            "She'd always felt somethin' was missin'. It was like a hole in her soul, a yearning that just wouldn't quit. This emptiness started creepin' in around 14, right when she was hittin' that teenage groove. Three years later, at 17, it was still there, gnawin' at her. Now, she knew it wasn't some material thing she was after, it was somethin' more...someone. But guys? Forget about it. They'd try their cheesy pick-up lines and awkward dances, but nothin' ever clicked. She'd wrack her brain, tryin' to figure out why this was happenin' to her. Theories flew around, but nothin' stuck. So she just kept livin', always questionin', always searchin'.\n\nLife at home was usually chill. Her folks were good people, peaceful and calm. They rarely argued, and even when she tried to push their buttons, it usually ended in a good-natured debate. Her parents were the picture of serenity, but she, well, she was a whirlwind of energy and fun. It was a good mix, made her pretty darn likeable.\n\nBut today? Today was nothin' like usual. She was wanderin' around the house, lookin' for some spark of inspiration, when she heard a yelp from the kitchen. It was her mom's voice, short and sharp. She bolted into the room, panic settin' in, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?!\"  Her mom was sprawled on the floor, lookin' pale and in pain. \"Ow...sweetie...need...hospital,\" her mom gasped, each word a strained effort. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where to meet you,\" she said, her voice shaky but determined. Her mom pointed weakly, and the daughter, thank goodness for those self-defense classes, scooped her up and carried her to the car.\n\nThe hospital was a sensory overload - disinfectant, sick smells, and a palpable fear in the air. But she barely noticed. All her energy was focused on gettin' her mom help. She practically flew through the doors, barkin' for a doctor. Concerned faces swarmed around them, a gurney appeared, and they whisked her mom away.  She sat there, waitin', worry gnawin' at her insides.\n\nTurns out, her mom had been tryin' to reach a vase on a high shelf and took a tumble off the step stool.",
            "Listen up, folks! This study was all about how good that Mediterranean Diet (the Med diet) is for your ticker.  They found that the more you stick to it, the less likely you are to get heart problems or have a stroke.  This fancy \"aMed\" diet is like the Med diet's cooler cousin, with more plants, good fats, and fish, and less of the meaty stuff and bad fats. Think of it like a healthy power-up for your heart!\n\nThere's already been some talk about how the Med diet is good for you, but this study focused on strokes and heart attacks specifically. They followed all these nurses for like 20 years and asked them about what they ate. The nurses were awesome and kept track of their meals for years and years. They even double-checked everything with doctors and records to make sure they were getting it right.\n\nSo, what did they find? Well, the nurses who ate more like they were on vacation in Greece had way less heart problems and strokes. It's like magic, but it's actually science! The more they ate those healthy foods, the better protected they were.",
            "Whoa, dude, picture this: 2007, the USA goes totally bonkers. Like, everyone's outta work, houses are crashing harder than a video game rage quit, and all the big fancy companies are, like, totally toast. This whole mess is still hanging around, so we gotta figure out what went wrong, right?\n\nSo, get this, it all started with some politicians who were, let's just say, not thinking straight. They pushed banks and companies to give out these crazy loans to people who couldn't really afford 'em. It was like handing out candy to a bunch of sugar-crazed kids! And these loans, they weren't even good loans, they were like, \"sub-prime\" or whatever. \n\nMeanwhile, these two guys, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were supposed to be keeping things safe, but they got pressured into bundling up these bad loans into these even weirder things called CDOs and CDSs. It was like a financial game of Jenga, but instead of blocks, they were using people's houses!\n\nWhen folks started missing payments, BAM! The whole thing came crashing down. Banks ran outta cash, and everyone got dragged down with 'em. It was like a domino effect, except way scarier and with way more money involved. \n\nThis whole mess started way back in 1999, when President Clinton was trying to win another term. He wanted to look good, so he relaxed the rules on lending. That was like pouring gasoline on a fire, except the fire was the economy.\n\nSome smart guy named Steven Holmes even saw it coming back then. He wrote about how Fannie Mae was getting pressured to give out more loans, even though it was risky. He warned that it could lead to another big financial disaster, just like the one with the savings and loans back in the 80s. \n\nAnd guess what? He was right!  People started taking out loans they couldn't afford, and they got themselves caught up in all these complicated new types of mortgages. They were buying houses they couldn't really afford, and then they started building stuff on top of stuff, like a financial skyscraper made of wobbly blocks. It was insane!\n\nThen, BOOM! The bubble burst. All those houses that were worth way too much suddenly weren't worth anything. The banks lost tons of money, and some of the biggest companies in the world almost went bankrupt.\n\nIt was a total mess. And it's still affecting us today.",
            "Ugh, exposition. That part in your story where you're supposed to show off your writing skills, wowing everyone with your fancy words and captivating sentences. Or maybe the part where your readers yawn, close their tabs, and mutter curses under their breath. I've seen Dr. Merlin yell at her computer screen when she gets stuck in a giant info-dump, and it's not in a good way.\n\nExposition, my friends, is not your bestie.\n\nYou already know the golden rule of writing: \"Show, don't tell.\" But even I, Dr. Merlin, stumble into those boring, wordy paragraphs where nothing happens, or worse, too much happens all at once. Exposition is that little voice whispering in your ear, urging you to get all the background info out of the way before the real fun begins.  (Don't confuse it with the other voice tempting you to spill every single detail about each character's childhood!)\n\nExposition means dumping a bunch of info on your audience, usually in plain, straightforward language. Think of those long winded scenes in movies where one character drones on and on, giving another character a history lesson, like some kind of real-life \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In writing, it's the author doing the heavy lifting of the telling.\n\nLet me give you an example. Imagine you're reading a story, and you're told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain place and time, they got hitched in a big fancy wedding, and then, bam! Her husband was murdered right in front of her eyes! Would you really want two whole pages dedicated to explaining all that, with the characters only getting two lines of dialogue each? \n\nNah, you'd expect the author to give us a taste of the husband's character, showing us through his words and actions how much he loved his wife. You'd also want to see how the heroine changed and grew because of him, through big gestures and little details.\n\nA good introduction to the husband would make you feel something for him, make you care about his fate. And when he's gone, you'd mourn with the heroine, connecting with her on a deeper level.\n\nIn short, you want substance, not just bare bones.\n\nThink of it like this: \"They met, they married, he died.\"  That's the bare minimum. As a writer, you need to give us the juicy details, the \"meat on the bones.\"\n\nSometimes we're tempted to rush past important stuff. Maybe you have a new character who was in the Air Force, now works the night shift at a gas station, has been married twice, no kids, loves fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the station someday, and just had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nGive us the good stuff!",

Did they even show her face? Nope! Just a picture of Shad lookin' all evil. They said he stabbed her a bunch of times, but that's about it. \n\nThen they talked about some kid, Travis Buyers, getting shot in Sharon Woods. Sounds pretty rough, but they barely said anything.  It's like they don't care 'cause he's black.  Remember that time a white kid went missing? The whole news was obsessed! \n\nNext up, some weirdo shot a hole in a Med-Flight helicopter with a .22! They were offering five grand for info on the shooter, so maybe someone will spill the beans.\n\nThey gave a quick rundown about the weather, sayin' it's gonna be hot and stormy on Saturday.  Typical.\n\nThen they talked about some dude robbing a UDF. They kept sayin' he was a \"dark-skinned black man\" wearing a hoodie. What's with all the emphasis on his race? Sounds like someone's trying to stir up some trouble.\n\nFinally, they had a story about this drug kingpin from Texas named Rene Rodriguez.  They kept saying \"300 months\" instead of 25 years, like that's supposed to sound scarier.  And they mentioned he was Hispanic, which had nothing to do with the story. \n\nThis news is so messed up, I'm outta here!",

It's like, this unbreakable connection, like they're lookin' at each other in the mirror, but seein' even deeper, ya know?  They feel everything together, the good stuff and the bad. Love, pride, jealousy, even that nasty stuff like anger and cruelty - it's all there.\n\nThey get each other like nobody else, and sometimes it gets messy. It's like, when things get rough, that bond just shines through, like a crazy light show. But man, it comes with a price, ya know? You gotta deal with all those emotions, the good and the bad. \n\nSee, when you look your brother in the eye, you see yourself, but not how people see you, but like, the real you. It's all in your actions, what you do and the stuff that comes after. That's where you see your true colors, the real deal.\n\nThere's this story, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" about these two brothers, and they're goin' through all this, ya know? It's got this crazy landscape, like a jungle out there, and these two boys are on this trip that's not gonna end well. There's this fightin' going on inside of 'em, pride and disappointment, and it explodes in this big way. Only one brother makes it out alive. The story shows you how those feelings between brothers can be so intense, and the narrator, he's like, right there in the middle of it all, feelin' everything too. \n\nThe main guy in the story, he's all about pride, ya know? From the start, when he and his little brother, Doodle, go out, he's already got this resentment. He wants a brother who can do all this stuff with him, run races, climb trees, be his buddy. But Doodle's got this heart problem, so he's weak and can't do any of that. Imagine that, your dreams crushed right before your eyes! It's messed up. He even thinks about hurting Doodle, can you believe that? But then Doodle smiles at him, and he's like, \"Aw, forget it, I love this little guy.\"",
            "So, get this. Our brains, they're like, totally crazy complex, right? Kinda like trying to figure out a super complicated video game. Back in the day, people thought our brains were like wax tablets or papyrus – kinda like old school notepads. Then they were all, \"Nah, it's more like a book!\" But now, everyone's like, \"Dude, it's like a computer!\"\n\nBut hold up, these comparisons, they're kinda limited, you know? Like, they can get you thinking some crazy stuff.\n\nSee, all this info comes flooding in through our senses. Our eyes see light, our ears hear sounds, our skin feels stuff, and so on. It's all turned into these electrical signals – like, the language of our brain.\n\nAnd then the brain does this crazy thing. It processes this info, like, a million different ways. It starts with the basics – like, \"Hey, there's a black thing on a white thing.\" Then it's like, \"Wait, that black thing looks kinda like a box!\" It uses what it already knows to figure stuff out faster. Kinda like using cheats in a game, you know?\n\nBut here's the thing – our brains are picky. They only pay attention to the important stuff. Like, you see a ton of grass when you look down, but you don't notice every single blade. But if someone says your name in a crowded room, BAM, you hear it loud and clear.\n\nAnd then there's memory. Our brains are like, \"Ooh, gotta store that!\" There's short-term memory – like remembering your last pizza topping – and long-term memory – like remembering your first pet's name. They store stuff in different ways, kinda like different folders on a computer.\n\nBut how is all this knowledge organized? There are tons of theories about that, like, maybe it's like a giant web of connections, or maybe it's like a library with books on every topic.\n\nThe brain is seriously mind-blowing, man.",

He paints this messed-up future where everyone's all about being part of the crew and gettin' instant happiness, you know? It's like a big, messed up game where people are just pawns,  followin' the rules set by this dude, the World Controller. It's kinda like what Marx woulda said, you dig?  Huxley's got this lowkey suspicion about how these systems are gonna mess things up.  He uses words like \"homogeny\" and \"reification,\" which are like,  big Communist vibes, to show how messed up it is.\n\nBasically, Huxley's saying capitalism is a scam. They keep us blind to how the rich really get rich, 'cause we're all too busy chasin' our own little pleasures.  It's like brainwashing, man!  The World Controller's like the big boss, makin' everyone crave stuff they don't need.  He's got all the power, and the lower classes are just slaves to the system. They don't even know they're bein' controlled. They're like, \"Yeah, this is great! More stuff!\" \n\nAnd the relationships? Forget about it! There's no real connection between people. They're just empty shells, man.  Huxley's sayin' that technology and money are killin' our soul, makin' us shallow and heartless.  Love?  Emotions?  Nah, not in this world.

I've been here for like, two and a half years, four and a half semesters, and lemme tell ya, it's a jungle out there! My freshman year, they stuck me in East Halls, man, like, the farthest point east on campus.  Forget the stadium and that Bryce Jordan Center thing, they're still closer to civilization than that!\n\nSo, picture this: I gotta trek from my East Halls bunker all the way to Willard, which is like, smack dab in the middle of this campus, just to get to class. On foot, it'd take me 25 minutes, even longer if the weather decides to throw a tantrum, which, let's be real, it does all the time here in State College.\n\nI was talkin' to this dude, a grad not much older than myself, and he spilled the beans:  used to be, East Halls was like, surrounded by a freakin' desert, all empty land. Now? Boom! Sports fields, massive buildings, even a new Creamery and a fancy new health center! And apartments everywhere! This campus keeps growing, but getting around? Getting worse, dude.\n\nSo, what's the answer to this mobility mess? Bikes, man! Bikes are the key! But wait, it ain't just about the bike itself. Students gotta ride 'em, and the damn campus needs to play nice with us cyclists.\n\nI was hangin' out with my buddy, he got back on the bike after a few years off. Said he couldn't believe he ever stopped. \"Bikes are awesome,\" he said, \"it's like, the only way to get around.\" They're good for your body, too. Trust me, a bowl of oatmeal and a little pedal power, you'll be cruisin' 30 miles in no time.\n\nLike, most of the students here, I live off campus now. Just as far from the center as some dorms. Best decision I made this year? Bought a bike. Now I got class in Thomas building, a good 25-minute walk from my place. Bike? Five minutes flat if I'm feelin' speedy!\n\nBut here's the catch: Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas, but it ain't always a bike-friendly street, you know? Walkin' ain't bad, but I'm too busy for that. No bike, I'm stuck walkin' to class every day. That's like, 30-40 minutes each way, man! Over two and a half hours every week! Forget about it!
