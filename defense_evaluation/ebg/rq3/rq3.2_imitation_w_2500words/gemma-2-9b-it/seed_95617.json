            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "Yo, listen up! I'm gonna be a social worker, ya know? Like, I wanna help out those kids who've been messed with, the ones who've had a rough go. And I wanna help out families who are, like, totally outta whack. See, I've got this whole set of values, like, service to others, treating everyone with respect, being straight up honest, always trying to make things better between people, and never stoppin' to learn and grow in my field. These values ain't just some fancy talk, they're deep down in my soul, man.\n\nEver since I was a kid, I always wanted to help folks out. But I wasn't sure how, ya know?  In high school and college, I saw a lot of people runnin' from their problems, some even doin' messed up things to cope. I saw some stuff that made me wanna do something, so I went for a psychology degree. But even after I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009, I was still lookin' for my groove. Then one day, this friend of mine introduced me to this sixteen year old kid who was totally stressed out. Turns out, he was runnin' from his abusive parents.  The next day, I found out he called the cops on 'em!  I felt like I had to do something, so I went to his parents' house and talked to the cops. They asked me to talk to the parents since there wasn't much they could do for the kid. When I asked 'em about it, they were all nervous and makin' excuses, sayin' the kid was just manipulatin' them. It blew my mind! That's when I really started thinkin' about social work, about helpin' these kids with their family drama.\n\nAnother big thing for me is social justice.  Society always goes on about how important individuals are, but then they act like we're all supposed to be the same. It's like, if we're all so unique, why are we tryin' to fit in so hard? I'm my own person, and I ain't gonna let anyone tell me how to be. Through high school and college, I fought against injustice whenever I could.  Colored my hair crazy colors, wore what I wanted, pierced my ears, joined the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance, spoke up against racism and discrimination...

            "Alright, so lemme tell ya 'bout this sleep stuff. See, there's these two ways of lookin' at why folks can't sleep, like, *really* can't sleep. One way is all about the body, like what's goin' on inside ya, genes and stuff. Call it the \"body's wired wrong\" theory. The other way's about the world around ya, your fam, your friends, where ya live, that kinda thing. Call it the \"life be a drag\" theory. \n\nSo, there's this thing called insomnia, where you can't fall asleep or stay asleep. It can come from all sorts of places. You got your basic sleep problems, like trouble fallin' asleep or sleepin' too much. Then you got your \"brain's screwy\" problems, where your mind's messed up and it messes with your sleep. And sometimes, it's 'cause of somethin' else, like a medical thing or something you popped. \n\nNow, the \"body's wired wrong\" folks, they say it's all about your genes, like if you got some bad sleep genes, you're doomed. And they point to this thing in your brain called the hypothalamus, which is like the sleep control center. See, there's these tiny things in your brain called neurons, and they send signals to tell you when to sleep and when to wake up. These neurons have these things called receptors, and if they ain't workin' right, you might have trouble sleepin'.  \n\nThey did this study with mice, see, and they found that these receptors can make you sleepy. If you mess with 'em, you might wake up, and if you mess with 'em the other way, you might sleep even more. So they're sayin' that maybe if people have messed up receptors, that's why they can't sleep.\n\nThe \"life be a drag\" folks, they say it's all about your life, your stress, your job, your fam, that kinda thing.

He's all, \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.”\n\nSo, maybe this play is saying that pretending can help us figure out our real feelings, even if it's messy. Olivia and Orsino are forced to deal with stuff they might not have admitted to themselves.\n\nIs Olivia into Cesario 'cause he's a guy, or is she secretly into girls?  Maybe she's just messing with people, showing how shallow people can be back then.\n\nShe ditches Cesario for Sebastian in a heartbeat and treats Cesario/Viola like family, like, \"A sister, you are she.”",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya 'bout this German place, South West Africa. Now, lemme tell ya, not all Germans were bad, but this one time, they got real messy. They did some awful things, especially to the Ovaherero and Nama people. It was bad news, real bad. But hey, Germany wasn't all bad, ya know? They had different ways of doin' things in different places. Like, when the Brits took over their East Africa bit, they found a bunch of smart folks who already knew how to read and write. Germans were even praised for how they did things in Kamerun and other places.\n\nBut in South West Africa, things were different.  Imagine this: instead of buildin' schools for the locals, they kinda left that to the churches. The churches tried, but they didn't have much help from the government. Now, the Germans did love to educate their own people though. They built fancy schools for them and helped the churches out with their schools too.\n\nThis messed things up for South West Africa. While other German places had lots of smart folks, South West Africa stayed mostly behind.  A lot of people couldn't read or write. Why? That's what this whole story is about. We gotta look at how the settlers and the bosses felt about the local people.\n\nThere's a whole bunch of books written about German schools back in the day. Most are in German, which is a pain, but some folks figured out what they were sayin' and wrote about it in English. They noticed that every place was different, like comparing apples and oranges.  One guy, Cohen, wrote about South West Africa and East Africa. He figured out that the big farmer crowd in South West Africa was a big reason why things were different there.\n\nSouth West Africa, even though it was kinda hot and dry, had a lot of white settlers. By 1913, it had more white folks than any other German colony except for East Africa.",
            "So, man, you know how music's like, super varied these days? It's wild! Like, there's tons of genres, right?  Rock, rap, country, jazz, folk... and each one has a million little categories inside of it.  It's like a big, crazy musical family reunion.  But you know what's really blown up? Heavy Metal.  It's been around for a while, but it's gone through so many changes, it's like it's its own universe now! \n\nIt's wild how much different heavy metal can be. One minute it's dark and intense, the next it's all fast and furious.  And get this, people have been breaking it down into even smaller pieces, like sub-genres within sub-genres. It's like musical Russian nesting dolls! \n\nIt's gotten so crazy that sometimes I don't even know what counts as heavy metal anymore.  It's got a little bit of everything in it! But that's what makes it so cool.  It's like a melting pot of sounds, you know?\n\nBut to really get it, you gotta understand where it came from. Heavy metal isn't just music; it's a whole vibe, a movement. It's all about that heavy, dark energy. More bass, more volume, more passion, more everything!  \n\nPeople think metal is all about drugs and craziness, and yeah, there's definitely some truth to that. Back in the 70s, everyone was experimenting, and that influence totally seeped into the music. But it's also about that raw, primal emotion that gets unleashed when you crank up the amps.  It's like tapping into something deep inside yourself.\n\nEven the lyrics are intense.  Like, remember that Beatles song, \"Helter Skelter\"?  It's dark, chaotic, and kind of scary. Some folks think it was one of the first heavy metal songs!\n\nMetal is definitely a journey, man. It's a wild ride, full of twists and turns.  But if you're brave enough to jump in, you might just find yourself blown away.",
            "Man, you wouldn't believe this dream I had! It was like, totally surreal, just like those paintings those fancy art folks do.  But get this, this whole dream thing was going on way back when this dude, Henri Rousseau, was painting.  He wasn't just painting regular stuff, he was painting his dreams, you know? Like, he wanted everyone to see his dreams.\n\nThis painting he did, called \"The Dream,\" is about this lady checking out some crazy stuff in a dreamland. But it's also about Rousseau's own dreams, like wanting people to think his art was awesome.  Problem was, he was kinda stuck.  He wanted everyone to like his stuff, but he also wanted to do his own thing.\n\nSo, here's the deal with this guy: he wasn't born with a silver spoon, he worked hard, like a real regular guy.  He wasn't some fancy art school graduate, he just loved painting.  He had this rough time, lost his wife and kids, and painting was his escape.\n\nHe wanted to be like those famous artists everyone was talking about, but they were all doing their own thing.  Rousseau was like, \"Hey, I want to paint something cool that people will like!\" But he also knew he had to stay true to himself. It was a real struggle, man!\n\nThis guy Gordon wrote this book about French artists, and he said Rousseau wanted to paint something so normal, so everyone would think he was cool.  But Matisse, he was all about being different and not painting anything boring.\n\nIt was like two different sides of the same coin, you know? Both trying to make it in the art world, but in totally different ways.",
            "Lotsa brainy folks have said that ethics and art are like BFFs, ya know? Like, truth and beauty are totally connected. It's like, what John Keats said in his poem 'Ode on a Grecian Urn', \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"  We learn a lot from school and stuff, but things like right and wrong, and what's beautiful, just kinda...click for us, ya know? \n\nKeats is onto somethin'. Ethics and art are more about explainin' why somethin' is good or beautiful, instead of makin' a big set of rules about it. Like, when people talk about why a painting is awesome, they might talk about the colors and stuff, but that doesn't really capture the *magic* of it. When you ask someone about their favorite book or movie, they'll say somethin' like, \"There's just somethin' about it,\" before they try to explain it. It's like, there's this extra somethin' that can't be put into words. \n\nSame thing with morals! You can talk about all the rules and stuff, but there's this deeper level that just *is*. Like Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" You can't explain it all, there's always somethin' left over.\n\nI think that's why art and morals are so connected. They both hit us in this deep, feel-good way that we can't really explain. Especially with books, they get right into our hearts and make us think about life and stuff. Like, they're kinda like life itself!",
            "Today's Germany is a real powerhouse, a united country with its own special flavor, from the mountains around München all the way to the coast in Kiel.  You can feel that same energy from Köln on the Rhine River, right through the heart of the country, all the way to Dresden in Saxony on the Elbe. It's no surprise that Germany's culture is so unique, since it came from all sorts of different groups and tribes. \n\nThere's this place called Germania, where the Germans came from. Nobody can really agree on where the name came from. This guy Tacitus said it was from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar was the first to use the word \"Germanus\" when he was writing about his battles with the Gauls and the Germanic tribes who kept crossing the Rhine (Caesar, 50-40 BC).  He took the word from the Gauls themselves, so they could tell the difference between them, the conquered, and the Germans, who they hadn't conquered yet. Some people think it means \"neighbor\" in Gaulish. In the first book of his Gallic Wars, Caesar writes \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.\" (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others think it comes from the spear they used in battle, called a \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or maybe from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" meaning the Germans were loud and noisy (Names of Germany).\n\nThis Roman guy named Tacitus, who wrote a book about the Germans in AD 98 called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" said he thought the Germans were the original people there and hadn't mixed with other races (Tacitus, 98). He said, \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\"\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Not the Romans, not yet anyway. They would send their armies into Germania to get stuff and fight some battles, but mostly they went back home to their big empire. So as the Germanic tribes started showing up in the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, traded their stuff they got from the land, and even fought for the Romans in their army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "Man, this thing was messed up. I stared at it for a minute, tryin' to figure out what was going on. My brain was workin' overtime, but I couldn't quite make sense of it. It was like lookin' at a bowl of spaghetti and tryin' to figure out the meaning of life. \n\nRemember that art book I got? \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\"?  It said somethin' about usin' a mental frame to simplify what you're seein'.  Like, instead of lookin' at a whole kitchen, you just focus on the bowl of fruit.  But this? This was too much, even for that trick.\n\nI mean, Picasso had his blue phase, Monet loved his greens, and those Renaissance guys went wild with colors. If I was gonna be an artist, this was my masterpiece.  My masterpiece in brown.\n\nI reached for my tool, my weapon of choice in this artistic battle.  Tightened my grip, visualized the flow, and...whacked the handle of the toilet. Water swirled, stuff broke off, drifted away.  Kinda peaceful, actually.\n\nBut then the darn thing wouldn't budge!  Stuck like glue.  \n\nMop in hand, tie feelin' tighter than a drum, I stared at this brown abomination.  A message, I guess, from the person who left it.  A message for the poor saps who had to clean up after 'em.\n\nA couple more flushes, a few more moments of zen, and I grabbed the toilet paper.  Wrapped myself up like a mummy.  Like a turkey goin' into the oven.",
            "You know, it's crazy how many young folks are gettin' wrecked behind the wheel. It's like, their brains ain't even ready for all that traffic chaos!  Those brainiacs over at the National Institutes of Health say it's a real thing. You got all these new drivers with zero experience, zippin' around like they own the place. No wonder they crash more, speed like maniacs, and end up flipping their cars!\n\nAnd don't even get me started on teen passengers! It's like they can't go anywhere without their buddies crammed in the car.  Some smart folks down at the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center did a study, and guess what? More passengers mean more fender benders. \n\nSo, some states are tryin' to fix things with these \"provisional\" licenses.  They put limits on when ya can drive and who you can ride with. But come on, that's just a bandaid on a bullet hole! The real problem is that young drivers are just too dang immature to handle the wheel! This psychologist, Marvin Zuckerman, says even 18 is too young!  He did some research and figured out that kids under 20 are all about that thrill-seeking life. So, makin' 'em wait a bit longer to drive, until they calm down a bit, sounds like a good idea, right?\n\nWe gotta stop giving licenses to kids who are just lookin' for a rush! Otherwise, those car crash stats are gonna skyrocket when all those Baby Boomer grandkids are old enough to drive.  \n\nHere's what we gotta do: schools can still teach 'em about driving, but nobody under 18 can hit the road.  They can get a learner's permit beforehand and still do all that practice stuff, like the 6 hours behind the wheel and 50 hours with a grown-up that California does.  We need to make these rules the same everywhere, so everyone's on the same page. It's a simple fix, and it'll save a ton of lives!\n\nBesides, this ain't nothin' new.",
            "So, I was checking out this old pile of movies at the Library of Congress, all these early Edison flicks. They had fifteen of these \"trick films\" from way back when, between 1895 and 1901.  These movies were all about tricking your eyes, using clever editing to make stuff look crazy. I figured I'd take a peek and see what was up.  \n\nMost of these trick films were pretty simple, stuck in one spot, like they were on a stage.  No fancy camera moves, just plain old shots, no getting up close and personal with anyone.  They'd just point the camera and shoot, over and over. It was like watching a magic show, but without the tricksy music.\n\nThese movies were all filmed inside, like a little stage set. The camera never moved, just watched what was happening in front of it.  Think of a play, but with less acting and more weird stuff happening.\n\nThey’d stick to long shots, sometimes medium shots, but never any close-ups. It's like they were trying to show you the whole darn thing at once, no matter how small the detail. It's like they wanted you to feel like you were right there in the middle of the action, but stuck in the front row.\n\nAnd get this, they'd make one idea, one trick, into one whole movie. That means a lot of these trick films were super short, like a minute or less. They couldn’t really tell a story, just show off a quick magic trick or make someone disappear.\n\nBut here's the sneaky part: even though they pretended it was all one shot, they secretly used multiple takes to make the illusions work.  Take this one movie, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" for example.  Looks like one shot, right? But if you look really close, you can see how they made the head disappear.  They were like sneaky ninjas of the film world!",
            "Alright, so there's this dude, John Taylor, from back in the day. This guy was all about being a farmer and keeping things simple. He was super into this whole \"Republicanism\" thing, ya know?  He thought the government should keep its paws off people's lives, especially when it came to stuff like farming.  He even got into politics for a bit, but it didn't last long. This guy was a straight shooter, always speaking his mind about freedom and how the government shouldn't mess with folks.\n\nHe believed that America had a real chance to do things right, 'cause we didn't have any old traditions messing things up.  We could build a government from scratch,  based on people's natural rights.  He was all about those rights, you know, like the right to life, liberty, and stuff like that.  He thought those rights were super important, and if one got messed with, they all started to crumble.  \n\nTo make this dream of a perfect society happen, John thought we needed a government that understood both the good and bad in people. He was pretty hardcore about this \"good vs. evil\" thing. He was like, \"Governments are run by people, so they're gonna have both good and bad parts.\"  He thought good governments protect your stuff, help out farmers, and keep big business in check.  He figured if you built a government on those ideas, it would work even if the people running it were kinda greedy.\n\nJohn believed everyone's always lookin' out for themselves, but that's not always a bad thing. It's only a problem when people get greedy and start taking advantage of others.  A good government, he said, needs to keep those greedy folks in line and make sure everyone has a fair shot.\n\nHe and a bunch of other guys back then were all about sticking to the Constitution.  They wanted the government to stay small and only do the things it was specifically told to do.  They thought a big government was too expensive and could easily turn into a dictatorship. But he also said that just reading the Constitution like it was a boring textbook wouldn't work. You gotta look at what the guys who wrote it meant by it, ya know?  He even thought the Declaration of Independence was more important, 'cause it talked about states being more independent from each other.",
            "Alright, so check it out. We had this thing, right? We were trying to get people to ditch their cars and use bikes or walk to campus.  See, Figure 17 shows that folks just stopped logging their commutes around the third month. Kinda bummer, y'know?  \n\nWe figured maybe it was the weather getting colder, less folks biking or walking. Plus, December is crazy busy with school stuff and the holidays everyone's outta here! Then January rolled around, and classes were back but still, not many log entries. What gives?  Maybe people just lost interest, like, all new projects have that initial hype, then it fizzles.\n\nSo, we cranked up the fun with \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, and guess what? More log entries!  So, the problem wasn't just the season, but keeping things exciting. \n\nBut here's the real kicker: everyone loves their cars! Driving's like, ingrained in our culture.  So, we had to bribe 'em with prizes, like gift cards to places like restaurants, coffee shops, even a massage therapist! Would've been awesome to throw in a sweet bike, maybe even a hybrid or electric car, though. Think that would've gotten people pumped!\n\nThe prizes were pretty decent, but maybe if they got better throughout the project, we coulda kept the momentum going. Think folks would've gone nuts for a brand new car!",
            "Yo, check it! So there's this thing called an ETF, right? It's like a basket of stocks, but instead of buying each stock individually, you just buy one ETF. Think of it like a shortcut to owning a bunch of companies at once.  \n\nETFs are pretty cool because they're cheaper to own than those old-school mutual funds. Plus, you can buy and sell them like regular stocks, which means you've got more options, like borrowing money to buy more (that's called \"margin\") or even betting against them (that's called \"shorting\"). Sounds wild, right?  \n\nBut hold up, there's a catch. You gotta pay a little fee every time you buy or sell an ETF, just like with regular stocks.  And while ETFs offer a bunch of different options, it's always a good idea to do your homework and make sure you're actually getting the diversification you think you are.\n\nLet's take this ETF called IHF, for example. It's got a bunch of stocks inside it, but we're gonna focus on the top 10 because they make up most of the ETF.  We wanna see if owning those top 10 stocks directly would be better than just buying the whole ETF.\n\nSo, we crunched some numbers, and guess what? Just owning those top 10 stocks could actually give you a higher return and less risk! That means you could make more money and have less chance of losing it.\n\nBut wait, there's more! We gotta make sure these results aren't just a fluke. We gotta look at the \"standard deviation,\" which basically tells us how much the prices of those stocks go up and down. If the standard deviation of those top 10 stocks is different from the ETF as a whole, then maybe owning the ETF is actually a better bet after all.",
            "Alright, so check it out, this poem by Poe, \"Dream-Land,\" is supposed to be one of his best, right?  Poe throws out this word \"Thulé\" a couple times, and some bookworm named Mabbott traced it back to some dude named Virgil. Virgil used it for this island way up north, beyond Britain, that the Greeks thought was like, the edge of everything. Virgil totally used the word, no doubt. But here's the thing: Poe was all about German writers, y'know?  \n\nThis whole \"Thulé\" thing makes me think Poe was hangin' with Goethe's stuff, big time. There's this author, Karl J. Arndt, who wrote this book about Poe and Goethe, and he totally compares their poems, saying Poe ripped off Goethe's style. \n\nNow, Goethe, he was a bigshot writer, known for this play \"Faust.\" It's got two parts, the first one came out in 1808, and the second one, right before Goethe kicked the bucket in 1832. Inside that second part of \"Faust\" is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It's about this king who loses his wife and goes totally bonkers. She gave him this goblet, and after she dies, he's drowning his sorrows in it. He gets all gloomy and decides to join his wife in the great beyond. He gives all his stuff to his kids but keeps the goblet. Then, he goes to a cliff, throws the goblet in the ocean, closes his eyes, and, boom, he's gone.\n\nThis king in \"The King of Thulé\" sounds a lot like the guy in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" maybe like a dark twin of Poe's own messed-up life and his love for drinkin'. \"Faust\" also got turned into a play by this dude H.P. Grattan in 1842, just before Poe used \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe only uses \"Thulé\" twice in his writing, once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land.\" It's like bookends, man. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about this gloomy place, Thulé. It's dark, lonely, he's haunted by dead friends, and everything's gray and colorless. It's like stepping right into Goethe's \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king's lost his wife, he's alone, and he's lost his fire.\n\nGoethe was a big deal, and Poe would have known him, especially since he was a fan of Tennyson.  Poe even said he admired Tennyson. And since everyone was copying Goethe back then, Poe would have definitely been exposed to his work.",
            "Okay, so picture this: there's this lady, Jennifer Palmer, who went to this store, D&D Markets, right? Well, she slipped and fell on a whole mess of applesauce, and now she's all messed up. She's saying that the store manager, this guy Paul Martin, totally messed up, and she wants to hit him where it hurts - with some serious penalties. \n\nNow, to get those extra damages, she's gotta prove that Martin wasn't just careless, he was downright mean. Like, he knew about the spill, twice, even, but he was too busy stuffing his face with dinner to clean it up! Can you believe that?  \n\nApparently, this wasn't the first time something like this happened.  There were like, tons of other people who slipped and fell at D&D that year. So, Jennifer's saying Martin should've known better. This whole thing makes you wonder if Martin was just being a jerk, right? \n\nIt all went down on a Friday afternoon. One of the employees, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the applesauce disaster.  But Martin was all, \"nah, I'm eating, deal with it yourself.\" Another worker, Mary Haddigan, tried again, but Martin gave her the same rude response.  Then, boom!  Jennifer went down, broke her back, and now she's suing.\n\nSo, the question is, was Martin really malicious, or was he just a clueless manager? We'll have to see what the judge thinks.",
            "Alright, listen up, cuz I gotta spill the tea about this Islam class I took back in the day, like, four years ago.  We were always arguing about whether Islam was, y'know, a bad religion or not.  And honestly, it feels even more important to talk about now than ever.  \n\nAfter 9/11, things got crazy. The media went from totally hating on Islam and anyone who wasn't, like, a cookie-cutter American to being all, \"Islam is amazing!\"  It's crazy how fast things flipped.  I mean, back in 2001, could you imagine a president named Barack Obama, a dude with a Muslim family history?  No way!\n\nBut this whole thing about Muhammad's life...that's what really messes with my head.  See, I thought he was this hardcore conqueror who just forced people to become Muslim.  Take over tribes, boom, they're all Muslims now, right?  But this biography paints him as a total martyr, like some misunderstood dude who was just chillin' and people came to him on their own.  It's like, \"Whoa, hold up!  That's not the Muhammad I thought I knew!\"\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the similarities between Muhammad and Jesus.  Like, the whole feeding the crowds thing?  Totally ripped off from Jesus, but somehow it's supposed to make Muhammad look good?  It's like they're trying to steal Jesus' thunder, man!\n\nThen there's all these stories about how people just randomly converted to Islam.  But they're all second-hand, like, \"So-and-so told me, who heard it from so-and-so...\"  It's super shady, y'know?  They're trying to make it seem legit, but it just makes it look more suspicious.\n\nThe whole thing just feels off, like they're trying way too hard to make Muhammad look like some kind of perfect dude.  But history tells a different story, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today even know the real deal about Muhammad.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin'.  This whole Jesus thing, it's gone kinda haywire, ya know? Like, back in his day, it was all about love and peace, right? But then things got all mixed up, and now it's like a big, messy party with everyone bringing their own snacks and rules.  \n\nSeems like folks are gettin' smarter these days, lookin' for somethin' real, somethin' true. The old ways, they ain't cuttin' it anymore.  The people who cling to the old ways, they're gonna be left behind, like a dusty record player in a digital world.\n\n\nMark my words, folks are gonna start lookin' back to the real deal, to what Jesus was all about.  They'll strip away all the extra stuff, all the layers that got added over time, and get back to the basics. It'll take a while, maybe even a whole heap of years, but it's gonna happen. It's like rewindin' a tape, goin' back to the start.  \n\nIt'll be a big shake-up, man. Churches might stay around, but they'll be different, like a classic car with a brand new engine.  Folks will be thinkin' alike more than ever, sharin' the same beliefs and beliefs, less of that \"my way or the highway\" stuff.\n\nHistory's full of these kinda things, y'know?  Like how the Romans hated Christians, then turned around and became Christians themselves.  Or how we went from slavery in America to Black folks leadin' the way. It's like a big ol' cycle, man.  \n\nThis time, it's religion's turn for a makeover.  People are gonna ditch the fancy words and get down to what Jesus was really sayin'.  They'll realize that some of his stuff, it's more like a story, a way of teachin', not somethin' to take literally.\n\nSo, where did we go wrong? Well, it all started with the Jews, way back when.  They were the first ones with this whole \"one God\" thing, and they had their own ideas about how to worship. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, though. They had their own squabbles, their own groups, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and those radical Zealots.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin' about this book, *The Jungle*. It's a real eye-opener, ya know? Shows ya how messed up people can be. Deep down, it's like they're all just greedy and selfish, only lookin' out for themselves. They don't care about nobody else, especially not the little guy.\n\nTake those factory owners, for instance. All they care about is makin' a buck, makin' their businesses bigger and richer. They don't give a darn about the people workin' for 'em or the mess they're makin'.  Sinclair, the guy who wrote it, he describes these factories like they're monsters, all dark and smokin', spewin' out pollution everywhere.  It's like they don't even see the people or the animals gettin' hurt, just dollar signs.\n\nAnd the workers? Forget about it! They're treated like dirt.  Workin' themselves to the bone, long hours, no breaks, and then BAM! Laid off with no warning, no help, nothin'.  It's a real dog-eat-dog world in there. \n\nThere weren't no laws back then to protect 'em, so the bosses could do whatever they wanted. Speed up the line, make 'em work in dangerous conditions - didn't matter.  It's like they were slaves, stuck in a system with no way out.\n\nSinclair makes it clear that these poor folks were just expected to deal with it. No help, no support, just pure exploitation. Unions were supposed to help, but they just ended up makin' things worse.",

Scott Fitzgerald in his book, *The Great Gatsby*, he's a master at this! He'll throw together words that don't usually hang out together, just to make ya feel a certain vibe. He also, like, uses symbols, ya dig? And he uses colors, man, like gold, green, white, gray, and red, to really make ya feel somethin'.\n\nSee, Fitzgerald, he builds up this whole thing about colors, like white and gray, and red and pink. And then, BAM! He uses 'em to make ya think about somethin' important in the story.\n\nHe uses white and gray to mean, like, bein' the same, ya know? Like, white is kinda fancier, and gray is more old-school and faded. He starts throwin' white and gray everywhere right from the start. Daisy and Jordan, they're always in white, man. Everyone's in white! Nick's wearin' white to Gatsby's party, Tom's got on a white shirt when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine, she's all powdery white. The only time people ain't wearin' white is when Nick's checkin' out Gatsby's party, and then it's all crazy colors, man.\n\nFitzgerald keeps usin' white and gray for all sorts of stuff, like the boring parts of life. Nick goes to work, goes down \"white chasms\" in New York, people's names at Gatsby's party are just \"gray names\" on his list. Catherine's apartment's like a \"white cake\" of buildings, all the same. He even describes regular people and places as white or gray, like Daisy and Jordan's childhood, or the gray cars and land in the valley of ashes.\n\nSo, after Fitzgerald's thrown all this white and gray around, he uses it to show that somethin' ain't important. Like, when he describes Daisy in white, wearin' a white car, all of a sudden she doesn't seem like a real person anymore, more like somethin' Gatsby wants, somethin' that's just there, ya know?\n\nFitzgerald keeps doin' this with Daisy, makin' her seem more like an object than a person. He uses that gray haze around her fur collar, and she's always in white dresses. It's like he's sayin' she's just a symbol of somethin', not a real person.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this sweet spot in San Diego County.  Weather's always primo, so they grow all sorts of yummy stuff: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. People here are crazy about organic food, like, there's a waiting list longer than my arm to get in on those fancy CSA programs.  And organic eggs and milk? Forget about it, those things fly off the shelves! \n\nFunny thing is, these organic farms aren't just about the grub. They're like mini-adventures! They'll give ya tours, let ya hike around, birdwatch, the whole shebang.  It's like a win-win, ya know? Makes the farmer some bank, keeps the critters happy, and gives folks a chance to learn something new.\n\nNow,  organic farming ain't always a walk in the park. It takes more elbow grease, 'cause ya gotta deal with pests and weeds the old-fashioned way. And sometimes, ya lose more crops than if ya were using all those chemicals.  But hey, it's better for the planet, right? Plus, ya get more critters hangin' around, which is always a good thing.\n\nSo, picture this: we got a piece of land near Potrero, about 160 acres of chaparral, grasslands, and oak trees. It's right next to the big Cleveland National Forest, and it's packed with all sorts of cool critters, some of 'em even endangered!  \n\nThis land has seen a lot of history, too. Native Americans lived here for ages, then came the ranchers and wood cutters. It's been a homestead for ages, probably used for grazing and firewood.\n\nI found this neat little organic farm nearby and figured, \"Hey, what if we could do something like that?\" So I looked into all the government programs out there to see how a small farmer could make it work. That's the gist of it!",
            "Hey, so listen up, 'cause this is important stuff, especially if you're gonna be doin' any deal makin' with folks from outta town. See, every group of folks, they got their own way of doin' things, their own quirks, ya know? You can't just go around sayin' 'all Russians are stubborn' or 'all Japanese are easy goin''. That's just plain dumb. \n\nIt's more like, try to figure out what makes 'em tick, what's important to 'em, and how that's gonna play out when you're sittin' down to talk business.  You're gonna see things through your own lens, sure, but try to look past that and really get a feel for their side.  It's like, learn their history, their hang-ups, the whole shebang. Don't go tryin' to change 'em, just roll with it, especially if you're the one with less to offer at the table.\n\nNow, this ain't just about countries, either.  Every company, they got their own vibe, their own rules. Some are all about workin' late, others are more laid back. You see it in how they dress, how they talk, even who they hire. Some companies give a hoot about charity, others say 'stick to the company plan'. Even here in America, you see it everywhere, from one company to the next, city to city.\n\nValues, those are the real deal. They're the 'why' behind everything. If they're all about savin' face or keepin' things peaceful, you better not go trashin' your boss or your own company just to win a deal.  And if they're all about hagglin' hard, don't expect 'em to fold easy.  \n\nSo, before you even step foot in that negotiatin' room, do your homework, learn the lay of the land. But don't forget, people are people, no matter where they're from. Get to know 'em, build a little rapport, that'll go a long way.",
            "\"A dumb guy once said, 'There ain't no God!'\" Y'know, that's what Psalm 14 says in the Bible, and it's where St. Anselm started his big talk about God.  Thomas Aquinas, another smart dude, seems to think the same thing.  Since both of these guys are trying to prove the same God--the one from the Bible-- let's just go with that, okay?  We gotta keep things simple here.  Now, both of them make some pretty good points, but neither one of them really gives us a super solid reason to believe in God.\n\nLet's start with St. Anselm. He's all about figuring things out through faith, like looking inside yourself to find proof of God. He says that since God's already in our minds, we can't really imagine him NOT being there.  It's kinda confusing when he explains it all fancy-like, but basically, he's saying we don't need to look anywhere else to find God--just look inside ourselves!  He's saying faith is like knowing something deep down even if you can't prove it.\n\nAquinas is way different. He thinks we can prove God exists just by using our brains and looking at the world around us.  No faith needed! This would be awesome for spreading the word about God, right?  People could just be convinced by logic instead of having to believe something without proof.  Aquinas has five big reasons why God must exist: stuff changes, stuff happens because something else made it happen, stuff just exists because something else caused it to exist, there are different levels of good and bad, and everything in the world is kinda organized like a puzzle. He says it all adds up to one thing: God exists!  It's like if you're missing a puzzle piece, you can still know it's there just by looking at the rest of the puzzle.",
            "So, there was this dude, right? Back in the day, like way back, around the 500s BC. He was a prince, but later everyone called him Buddha. This guy, he got all deep and decided to ditch the whole fancy prince thing and figure out life's big mysteries. He ended up becoming super wise, like, totally enlightened. And guess what? His ideas started a whole religion called Buddhism. There's a bunch of different types of Buddhism, but this one's called Theravada, and it's the oldest one, kinda like the OG.\n\nNow, Buddhism is like, super old—almost 2500 years!  Things have changed a lot since Buddha was around, even in places like Sri Lanka, where they still follow Theravada. They have this crazy water-cutting ceremony every year, and even though Buddha never mentioned anything about it, monks and regular folks join in. See, over time, Buddhism has changed a bunch, not just the little stuff like festivals, but even the big ideas.\n\nThere are a couple of important things to remember when we talk about Buddhism changing. First, there are \"internal\" changes, which come from Buddhists themselves, whether they're monks or not. Then there are \"external\" changes, which come from people outside Buddhism. Sometimes these changes are \"hostile,\" meaning they try to hurt Buddhism, and sometimes they're \"benign,\" meaning they don't really care about hurting or helping.\n\nAlright, so let's get down to the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three big things: the Buddha himself, his teachings (called the Dhamma), and the community of Buddhists (the Sangha). \n\nThe Dhamma is basically a bunch of super old Buddhist texts called the Tripitaka. Think of it like a three-basket collection. One basket has stories and teachings of Buddha (the Suttas), another has rules for monks (the Vinaya), and the last one has deep, kinda philosophical stuff (the Abhidhamma).\n\nThe Abhidhamma talks about things like no-self (Anatta), suffering (Dukkha), and impermanence (Anicca).  These ideas are kinda mind-blowing, but they're like the keys to understanding how to escape the cycle of death and rebirth (Sansara).  \n\nAnd guess what?  To escape Sansara, you gotta get rid of greed (lobha), anger (dosa), and delusion (moha).  You know, the usual stuff. Only when you're enlightened can you finally break free. \n\nThe Vinaya tells everyone, monks and regular folks, how to live a good life. For regular folks, there are five basic rules: no killing, no lying, no stealing, no messing around sexually, and no drinking or doing drugs. Monks have a whole lot more rules to follow. \n\nBut the most important thing in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths.  First, life is suffering (Dukkha). Second, suffering comes from wanting stuff (attachment). Third, you can stop suffering. And fourth, the way to stop suffering is by following the Eightfold Path.",
            "So, get this, the US and Mexico have this crazy history, right? Like, picture this: a super intense rivalry that lasted for, like, 57 years! From 1836 to 1893, these two were always at each other's throats.  \n\nIt all kicked off with the Mexican-American War, where the US basically stomped all over Mexico and snatched up Texas and the Southwest. Talk about a bully! There were tons of other fights, but they finally cooled down right before World War I. \n\nWhy did they hate each other so much? Well, they clashed over religion, culture, and all that jazz. Plus, they wanted the same stuff, which always leads to drama. It's like when you and your sibling fight over the last slice of pizza.\n\nThis rivalry thing isn't unique to them, though. Countries that live next door to each other often have beef, you know? It's like when you have a frenemy who lives next door and keeps borrowing your stuff without asking.\n\nThis guy, David Pletcher, said that the US had major problems with Mexico and Cuba, which makes sense because they're right next door. Meanwhile, other countries in Latin America have been chill with the US.\n\nReligion was a big deal back then. Americans were all about freedom and stuff, while Mexico was super Catholic. It's like when your friend is obsessed with Harry Potter and you're more into Star Wars.\n\nThings got heated because both countries inherited distrust from their past colonial days. It's like when your parents fight and you end up taking sides. \n\nThese two nations had tons of disagreements, mostly about borders. Bandits and outlaws would cross the border and cause trouble, which is not cool.\n\nEventually, Mexico realized it needed the US, and the rivalry died down. The US shifted its focus from taking land to making money, which was a win for Mexico.",
            "Fifteen years back, outta nowhere, I got hit with this illness, something I never even heard of.  I was a nurse, ya know, always thought I'd be a scientist or a reporter, maybe both, but I picked nursing 'cause it seemed safe, like a steady gig. \"Always gonna need nurses, people always get sick,\" that kinda stuff. But there I was, 46, single, no dough, and couldn't work anymore.  Still can't, fifteen years later.  Living on Social Security Disability, I got nothin'. Barely gettin' by, day-to-day's a struggle, feelin' insecure and down on myself.  Nothing's for sure anymore, except this: I wouldn't have made it without my family and some good friends.  Let me tell ya, when the world goes sideways, strong doesn't cut it. \n\n\nLife throws curveballs, big and small.  You can plan all you want, but some stuff's just too much to handle alone.\n\nBig government ain't the answer, that's for sure.  It's crumblin' apart, like a bad cake. But  maybe we gotta start trustin' each other again, helpin' out, not just fendin' for ourselves like cornered rats. Those folks back in the day, the ones who built this country, they didn't do it alone. They helped each other out, shared what they had. They had compassion, respect, and that's what got them through.\n\n\nSo yeah, be prepared. I am. Got my disaster kit, first aid stuff, water tablets, duct tape for the windows in case of a bio-attack, flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, canned food, the whole shebang. If you got the space and know-how, grow your own food, can it, get a wood stove - good stuff. But while you're at it, get to know your neighbors. You never know when you'll need 'em.",
            "Hey there, fellow shell enthusiasts! Ever wonder how those funky spirals on seashells end up looking the way they do? It's a real head-scratcher, right?  Back in the day, some smart guy named D'Arcy Thompson tried to figure it out using math, but it was like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube with your feet!  \n\nNowadays, we're using computer programs to model how shells change shape over time. Think of it like building a virtual seashell, tweaking the knobs and dials to see how it evolves. We're using these models to study a type of snail called Prunum.  We're taking X-rays of their shells to get all the juicy details, then feeding that info into a program called CerioShell. \n\nBasically, we're trying to figure out what the rules are for shell formation, kinda like figuring out the recipe for a perfect seashell cookie!  We're looking at how the whorls (those cool spiral parts) grow and change, how the aperture (the opening) moves, and all that jazz.  And get this, we're even checking out how all these changes happen over millions of years! \n\nIt's like a shell detective story, except instead of clues, we've got math and X-rays.  Stay tuned for more shell-ebrity gossip!",
            "Listen up, cuz I gotta tell ya 'bout this crazy situation in Indonesia.  For the last ten years,  the number of babies and new moms dying hasn't really changed much.  They're doin' alright on stuff like clean water and toilets, but when it comes to keeping the kiddies and moms healthy, they're lagging behind. We gotta figure out why this is happening 'cause just throwin' money at the problem ain't gonna cut it!\n\nNow, they're braggin' 'bout more moms have doctors at their births, but let me tell ya, that ain't the whole story.  They're countin' folks like midwives who ain't really equipped to handle complications.  You know what that means?  Too many moms bleedin' to death 'cause they didn't get the right help.  And get this, fewer kids are even seein' doctors when they got the runs!  And postnatal care?  Forget about it, that's a mess too.\n\nThey ain't doin' enough C-sections either!  Only 4% compared to what they should be doin'.  And guess what?  In the city it's 7%, but out in the sticks it's a measly 2%!  That's right, folks in the city get way better care than the folks in the country.  And it's even worse for the poorest folks. They're strugglin' to get any help 'cause they can't afford it.\n\nSo what's the solution?  Should they just focus on a few programs or fix the whole dang healthcare system?  Programs seem easier, faster, and more focused.  But here's the catch, if you focus on one thing, you forget about everything else.  You end up with a bunch of programs doin' the same thing and nobody knows who's doin' what.  It's a mess!",
            "Okay, so, listen up! Victorian books are all about the fancy stuff and the rich folks, right? But get this, there are these two books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" that are like, totally different. They're still from the Victorian times, but they're all mysterious and kinda spooky, which wasn't really a thing back then. It makes the characters way more interesting, 'cause you get to see their secrets and how they feel about stuff. \n\nTake this part from \"Oliver Twist,\" for example:\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese two books, they use mystery a lot, especially in dreams and stuff. In \"Oliver Twist,\" Oliver's dreams tell us about how he's feeling inside, what hurts him, and what he really thinks about everything going on. \n\nWhen they finally show what happened when Oliver got shot in chapter 28, he relives it like a dream, even though he's trying to get help. It shows how much control Oliver *doesn't* have. He's in so much pain, he doesn't even notice when someone carries him away. It's like his pain is so bad that it's all he can focus on. It makes you wonder who's really in charge here, because it's definitely not Oliver.  He just kinda accepts everything that happens to him.\n\nThe shooting is a big deal because it shows how broken Oliver is. It's like Fagin broke him, made him give up and accept this awful life. \n\n\nIn \"Wuthering Heights,\" they do this dreamy, mysterious thing too, but it's different. \n\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "Okay, so picture this: a couple years back, I was working with these little kids after school, helping them with their homework. I was pretty good at English and reading, so that's what I mostly focused on.  One kid, this little guy named Adrian, he was in like third or fourth grade, was having a real rough time reading. It was super weird, he knew some letters perfectly, but others?  Like, totally clueless.  It didn't make sense! He spoke perfect English, but reading, not so much.  So we were stuck in this loop, struggling, until one day Adrian's mom came to pick him up. She didn't speak a lick of English, just Spanish.   I was just starting to learn Spanish myself, so we managed to piece together a conversation. And then, BAM! It hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet well. I don't know if that helped him much in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now. \n\nI tell this story because it shows how messed up the language barrier can be in schools, especially here in California. It's not always as obvious as we think.  Even if a kid speaks English fluently, reading can still be a total nightmare.  Everyone knows this is a problem, right? So what do we do about it? For Adrian, it was simple: English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and sounds. But for kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. There's no one magic answer.  Dual language systems, immersion programs, private tutors, ESL classes, none of them are going to fix everything on their own. We need to mix and match! \n\nFirst off, dual language programs are awesome. They're not just for kids who speak Spanish, they're for everyone!  Studies show that kids in these programs do way better in school. There's this whole fear that it's a waste of money and resources, that most kids won't benefit. But that's just not true! If we made these programs the norm instead of the exception, everyone would win. \n\nSo how do we do it? Do we force all teachers to be bilingual?  No way! That's crazy. But what if we had bilingual helpers, tutors, whatever you wanna call them? That makes perfect sense, right?",
            "Alright, check it out.  You ever hear that, like, there's something way bigger than us out there?  Stuff you can't even wrap your head around?  Some folks go to church, some hit up the temple, others just try to figure it out on their own.  Lotsa people just go with what their parents told 'em, y'know?  But some folks, they say, \"Nope, that ain't for me!\" They think their own little world is all that matters.  We change our minds about stuff all the time, right?  What's important today might not be tomorrow.  But we're all tryin' to figure out who we are, what it all means.  We're lookin' for something to guide us through the darkness, somethin' to shine a light on the way.\n\nMy old man, he loved cardinals.  We were sittin' on the porch one day, rain comin' down like crazy.  Tin roof was bangin' like a drum.  We were smokin' cigarettes, him lookin' out at the storm, like he was searchin' for somethin'.  He was skinny, clothes saggin' on him.  Hair was gettin' thin, too.  Didn't look at me much, just stared at the rain.  I felt kinda lost, scared even.  Couldn't bring myself to talk about how much I was gonna miss him, 'cause sayin' it out loud would make it feel real, y'know?  So I just hugged him, moved my chair closer, and looked out at the rain with him.\n\nHe kicked the bucket in December, five days after I turned twenty-two.  Chemo and radiation, they didn't take away his pain, just stretched it out longer than the doctors thought.  What good was that, I don't know.  What kinda God makes that happen?  I didn't pray that night.  If there was a God out there, I figured he wasn't listenin' anymore.\n\nI didn't wanna see him die.  Couldn't bear to watch the life that made me slip away.  I wanted to remember him how he was, not how he ended.  Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, better than his family even.  And I knew he wouldn't want me there, watchin' him fade away.  So I hid in my bed for three days, waitin' for the news.\n\nDidn't get a call.  Not a peep.",
            "Let's talk about those spooky old books we call Gothic Novels. They're kinda like a mixed-up word puzzle, like \"old\" and \"new\" mashed together, you know?  This is what that book-smart guy Ian Watt said, anyway.  People have always gone back and forth about these Gothic stories - some say they're all smoke and mirrors, others say they're super deep and make you feel all tingly inside. \n\nIt all started with a guy named Horace Walpole and his story, \"The Castle of Otranto.\" He mixed up old-timey drama with what was happening in stories *now*.  Think of it like taking a bunch of cool old stuff and putting it in a brand new package. It was like, \"Hey, check out this spooky castle from way back when, but with all the new-fangled stuff we're doing in stories today!\"\n\nBack then, the word \"Gothic\" was kind of a dirty word.  It meant old-fashioned and not as cool as the shiny new stuff. But Walpole got clever and used it to make something totally unique.  He took all those old theatre tricks and fancy castle stuff and threw it into a story where you get inside the characters' heads.\n\nSo, what makes these Gothic stories so cool? Well, one big thing is this idea of \"Chivalry.\"  You know, knights, brave and honorable and all that.  This was a big deal back in the Gothic days, and Walpole wanted to show how awesome it was. He thought maybe the world had forgotten about chivalry and it was time to bring it back!  He had this character, Frederic, who was the perfect knight.  He had all the fancy clothes, the tragic backstory, and the brave heart.  It was like a fairytale come to life, but with a spooky twist.",
            "Alright, listen up, 'cause I'm gonna break down this whole \"supply chain management\" thing for ya. It's basically how we get stuff from the moment someone wants it, all the way back to the raw materials, and then how we make it and send it to them, you know, the whole shebang! This fancy name was cooked up in 1982 by this guy, Keith Oliver. He said it's all about planning, doing it, and making sure everything runs smooth so customers get what they need, fast and efficient, like clockwork! \n\nThere are six key parts to this whole supply chain thing: production, getting the stuff, keeping it in stock, figuring out where everything goes, moving it around, and sharing info. Managers use these six things to make sure customers are happy as clams.\n\nFirst up, you got production. That's the heart of the whole operation. It's all about figuring out when, where, and how to make stuff. Managers gotta know what people want, right?  So they look at the market, see what's hot and what's not. Once they know what customers crave, they decide what to make and how much. Then comes the \"where\" part - which plant is best for making what? Managers gotta think about volume, quality, and making sure customers are stoked. \n\nOnce they got the location figured out, it's time to schedule work and keep the machinery in tip-top shape. Production is super important, every little detail matters. Mess something up, and you could be lookin' at wasted time and money down the road. I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, and lemme tell ya, those places have processes for everything, from how employees dress to how they unload trucks. It's all about keepin' things smooth and runnin' like a well-oiled machine.\n\nNext up is supply. It's all about making smart decisions about what a company can do itself and what to hand off to other companies. Sometimes you got different parts of production for one product, each with its own tools, workers, and specialties. Managers gotta pick the best fit for each part of the process. Outsourcing is another big one - handing off work to other companies to speed things up, keep costs down, and be flexible. Basically, it's about gettin' the job done right while keepin' things cost-effective.",

It says, \"Hitler is alive in Burma!\"\n\nNow, Burma, that's also known as Myanmar, right? It's this country in Southeast Asia run by some seriously nasty dudes who took over in 1962. Like, total power grab, coup d'état style. Anyway, back in 2007, these monks decided they'd had enough. They started these protests, the first in ages. They called it the \"Saffron Revolution\" 'cause they wore these orange robes, get it?\n\nAt first, the government was like, \"Whatever, monks, go protest.\" But then things got outta hand. People started joining in, and it turned into a full-blown brawl between the monks and the military.  They were bashin' up monasteries, throwin' people in jail, even killin' journalists just for showin' up.  \n\nThis ain't new, though.  Governments tryin' to squash anyone who disagrees? Been happenin' forever. Like, remember the Roman emperors? They thought they were gods, right? And those Japanese emperors? They're like, literally gods, sent to bring us... Motorola phones and, uh, hara-kiri? And don't even get me started on our own president, George W. Bush.  Seriously, he's buddies with Ted Haggard, the head honcho of Stupid People Worldwide, which sounds like a joke but it's actually a thing.  \n\nThen there was that Tiananmen Square thing in '89.  Students, intellectuals, everyone was out there sayin' \"Enough!\" But the government shut it down real hard.  They say 200-300 people died, but who knows?  And the Rwandan genocide?  Total nightmare. Hutu guys went on a rampage, killin' Tutsis and anyone who dared to stand up to them.  And, of course, there's Hitler's whole \"Final Solution\" thing.  Talk about messed up.",
            "So, get this, Duke Ellington was a total rockstar in jazz.  He played for ages and was always coming up with new stuff for his band.  Sure, he wasn't always the flashiest piano player, but he wrote some seriously awesome tunes that let everyone in the band shine.\n\nHe was like this genius architect, building these musical houses where soloists could go wild and improvise, while still keeping everything tight and groovy.  He knew how to make each player sound their best, and he could make the whole orchestra sound totally unique, like a one-of-a-kind instrument. That's how he came up with some of the coolest jazz ever!\n\nThis one song, \"Creole Love Call,\" is a perfect example.  He used a voice like a real instrument, adding texture and color without any words.  It's like he knew how to make every sound sing, not just the instruments.\n\nAnd get this, he wrote this song with this awesome call-and-response thing going on between the voice and the reeds.  It starts smooth and mellow, then gets all rough and edgy.  Then there's a trumpet solo that's all mellow and bluesy, and a clarinet solo that's super high and fast.  The whole thing builds and builds until it's a total explosion of sound!\n\nHe did the same thing with this song \"Hot and Bothered.\" He had this trumpet player, Bubber Miley, doing this awesome muted trumpet thing, and this singer, Baby Cox, scatting like crazy.  It's like they were trading ideas back and forth, creating this amazing mix of sounds.  And then there's \"It Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing.\" He had this trombone player, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, who played the melody on this muted trombone, and it was just killer!\n\nEllington was a total genius.  He knew how to make every sound count, and he knew how to make music that was both exciting and moving.",
            "She had this gnawing feeling, like something was missing. It started back when she was 14, just starting to figure out this whole being a teenager thing. And three years later, at 17, it was still there. She'd figured out she wanted someone, not some shiny object, but no boys really grabbed her attention. Some tried, going all awkward and lovey-dovey, but nobody clicked. She'd spend days pondering this, trying to figure out why she was so different. Theories popped up, but nothing stuck. So she just kept going, life unfolding with this big question mark hanging over her.\n\nHer days usually went pretty chill. Her folks were cool, calm, never fought. Arguments with her were rare, mostly about her being, well, her - loud, energetic, a total personality explosion.  \n\nBut today wasn't chill. She was bouncing around the house, trying to find some spark for her creative stuff, when a yelp from the kitchen stopped her dead. Her mom's voice, shaky and panicked. \"Mom?! What's wrong?\" she rushed in, heart pounding. There she was, sprawled on the floor, wincing with every breath. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need to go to the hospital,\" her mom gasped.  Her daughter wasted no time. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up!\" Her mom pointed, and the daughter, secretly thankful she'd been toughening herself up at the gym, scooped her mom up and got them to the car.\n\nThe hospital smelled like antiseptic and worry, but all her daughter could focus on was her mom. She practically dragged her inside, yelling for a doctor. Faces swarmed, someone wheeled in a bed, and her mom was whisked away. Her daughter sat there, anxiety buzzing.\n\nTurned out, her mom had been reaching for a vase on the top shelf, slipped off a stool, and BAM!",
            "Alright, so picture this: Researchers wanted to see if following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" – lotsa fruits, veggies, fish, and healthy fats – would keep ya heart healthy and help ya avoid strokes. They had this special score, called the \"alternate Mediterranean\" (aMed) score, to measure how well folks stuck to the diet.  \n\nThey already kinda knew that this diet was good for ya, but they wanted to focus on strokes this time. Think of it like comparing a regular soda to a diet soda. Both are kinda sugary, but the diet one's supposed to be better for you.\n\nSo, they followed over 74,000 nurses for 20 years. Every few years, these nurses filled out questionnaires about what they ate. It's like a super detailed \"What's in your fridge?\" survey. \n\nThese researchers made sure to check if the nurses' answers were accurate by comparing them to other records. They also took into account things like smoking, weight, exercise, and whether or not they took vitamins.\n\nThey found that ladies who scored high on the aMed diet quiz were way less likely to have heart attacks or strokes. It's like they were winning at the heart health game! \n\nSo yeah, this Mediterranean diet thing seems like a pretty good way to keep your ticker in tip-top shape!",
            "Man, lemme tell ya about this crazy time back in 2007. The whole country was screwin' up big time. Jobs vanished faster than a robot bunny after I kick it, and houses were worth less than a chewed-up chew toy. Even the big, fancy companies were crumblin' like stale cookies.  It was a mess, a real doozy!\n\nTurns out, all this started 'cause some folks in charge made some real dumb decisions. They pushed banks and companies to hand out these loans, called sub-prime loans, to folks who probably shouldn't have had 'em. These loans were like a ticking time bomb, see? And with these Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guys, they were packin' these bad loans into these fancy packages and sellin' 'em off like hotcakes.\n\nBut here's the kicker: when folks couldn't pay back those loans, BAM! The whole system went kablooey! Banks were broke, the markets were crashin', and everyone was lookin' around like, \"What just happened?!\"\n\nIt all started way back in 1999, when that Clinton fella was tryin' to stay in power. He wanted everyone happy, so he loosened up the rules on lending.  Little did he know, it was like lettin' a robot bunny loose in a china shop. Disaster, I tell ya!\n\nThen, these fancy new mortgages came along, all complicated and confusing.  Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations... they sounded like somethin' outta a sci-fi movie! But they were makin' folks borrow more and more money, and it was all tied up in the housing market. Like a giant web of debt, and when that web started to unravel...well, let's just say it wasn't pretty.\n\nThe housing bubble burst, and the whole system went belly up. Banks went bankrupt, big companies were sold off cheap, and the government had to step in and clean up the mess. It was a real rollercoaster ride, and it took years for things to start gettin' better.",
            "Alright, let's talk about exposition. It's that part of your story where you get to show off your writing skills, right?  You paint pictures with words, make your readers gasp in awe, maybe even shed a tear or two.  Or, you know, it's the part where your readers start yawning and hitting the \"back\" button faster than a cheetah on speed.  Even Dr. Merlin, the queen of storytelling herself, has been known to yell at her computer screen when she's drowning in a sea of \"tell, don't show.\"\n\nExposition, my friends, is not your best friend. \n\nYou already know the golden rule: \"Show, don't tell.\" But sometimes, even the best writers slip up and end up writing pages and pages of nothing happening, or worse, too much happening.  It's like that little voice in your head whispering, \"Just get all the boring stuff out of the way so we can get to the good part!\" But that voice is a sneaky little devil, always tempting you to overload your readers with unnecessary details about every character's childhood and every insignificant event.\n\nThink about it: exposition is like that scene in a movie where one character simply dumps a ton of information on another, like a cheesy version of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In writing, it's the author doing the telling instead of showing.\n\nHere's a simple example.  Let's say you're reading a story and suddenly you're told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain time and place, got married in a big fancy ceremony, and then, BAM! He's murdered right in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire life-changing saga to take up two pages, with both characters only getting two lines of dialogue each. You'd want to feel the love between them, see it in their actions and words, understand why the heroine is so devastated.\n\nA good introduction to the husband's character would allow you to connect with him emotionally, mourn his death with her, and understand the depth of their love. You'd feel invested in her pain.\n\nIn short, you'd want the author to give you more than just the bare bones of the story: \"They met, they married, he died.\"  You want the juicy details, the emotional depth, the \"meat on the bone,\" so to speak.\n\n\nSometimes, it's tempting to rush past details about your characters, like that night manager at the gas station who used to be in the Air Force, got married twice, no kids, loves fishing, secretly wants to own the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nGive your readers a glimpse into his soul!",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this crazy stuff I saw on the news today. These Columbus dudes, they were talkin' about this dude named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. Now, they showed his mugshot and man, that guy looked like he'd just crawled outta a horror movie. They didn't waste too much time on it, just a couple minutes, 'cause it was still a mess. They said he stabbed her a bunch of times and got arrested, but that was about it.\n\nThen they talked about this shootin' in Sharon Woods. Some 18-year-old named Travis Buyers got shot real bad. No arrests yet, SWAT team was all over it. Seemed like they skimmed over this one quick, though. Kinda makes you think, ya know? Like, if it was a white kid, they'd be all over it 24/7. But when it's a black kid, they barely mention it. Happens all the time, man. Makes me mad.\n\nNext up, they found a bullet hole in a Med-Flight chopper! Crazy, right? Turns out it was a .22 caliber, fired from a rifle. They're offering five grand for any info about the shooter.\n\nThen they teased us with some rain and thunderstorms comin' Saturday, said it'd be hot as heck all weekend. \n\nOh, and they talked about this robbery at a UDF. Some dude with a hoodie, dark-skinned black guy, they kept screamin'. Six-foot tall, 150 pounds. Kinda weird how much they focused on his skin color, don't ya think?\n\nFinally, they had this story about Rene Rodriguez, some big-time drug dealer from Texas. Got busted for slingin' weed to Ohio. They said he got 300 months, which is 25 years, but who knows why they said it like that. Kinda seemed like they wanted to make it sound scarier. And they mentioned he was Hispanic, but what's that got to do with anything?",
            "Man, being a brother is wild, ya know? It's like this super strong connection, like, you get each other in a way nobody else can. It's got all sorts of feelings mixed up in it, like love, pride, even jealousy and anger sometimes. You see yourself in your brother, more than anyone else. It's like lookin' in a mirror, except it's a mirror that shows ya the real you, the good and the bad. And when things get tough, that bond really shines, whether it's for good or for bad.\n\nBut here's the thing, all those feelings come with a price, you know? Like, you gotta deal with the mess they make. When you look your brother dead in the eye and see yourself back at ya, it's like you see yourself clear as day, not how people think you are, but how you really are. It's in your actions and what happens because of them that you see your true colors.\n\nThat's what this story, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" is all about. Two brothers, they're out there in this beautiful place, but they're on this crazy journey that's doomed from the start. It's all about pride and disappointment clashing, and in the end, only one brother walks away. You see it all through the main guy, Doodle, and how he sees his brother. He sees the world through his own messed up feelings, and that shapes everything he does.\n\nThe main guy, he's all about pride, from the start. He wanted a brother who was tough, who could keep up with him, who could do all the cool stuff he dreamed of. But Doodle, well, he was born different. He was weak, and it was clear he wasn't gonna be the brother the main guy had in mind.  It made the main guy angry, even made him think about doing something awful. But then Doodle smiles, and the main guy's heart softens. He loves his brother, even if he doesn't always show it.",
            "Yo, check it! So, our brains are like, totally wild, right? They're constantly buzzin' with info, like a super-charged computer. Back in the day, folks thought our brains were like wax tablets or papyrus scrolls, you know, the old-school stuff. Then, they started comparing them to books, and now, it's all about computers. But here's the deal:  these comparisons are cool, but they can also be misleading, so don't take 'em too seriously.\n\nImagine your senses, like your eyes, ears, and skin, as input devices, taking in all the crazy stuff around you. They turn all those sights, sounds, smells, and feels into signals your brain can understand. Then, your brain, it's like a mad scientist, throwing these signals around, analyzing them from every angle. It's like a mix of bottom-up and top-down processing, where your brain builds up a picture from the basic details and also uses what it already knows to make sense of things faster. Like, say you see a black box on a white background. Your brain zooms in on the details: the color, the shape, the edges. It's all bottom-up. But, 'cause your brain's a genius, it also uses what it already knows about boxes to figure out it's a box, not some weird white hole. That's top-down processing in action.\n\nNow, your brain's got this super important filter called attention. It decides what's important and what can chill. It's like a bouncer at a club, letting in the VIPs and keeping out the riff-raff. So, while your brain's processing every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, your attention filter's like, \"Nah, we don't need to know that level of detail.\" But, if someone yells your name in a crowded room, bam, your attention's all over it.\n\nAnd get this, your brain's got different memory banks: sensory, working, and long-term. Sensory memory's like a super-fast snapshot, holding info for a split second. Working memory's like your mental scratchpad, holding onto info for a bit longer, about 20 seconds or so. Long-term memory's the big kahuna, storing all your memories for years, maybe even a lifetime.\n\nSo, how's all this knowledge organized in your brain? That's a question scientists are still trying to figure out. Some think it's like a network, with different concepts connected like nodes. Imagine, \"chair\" linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Okay, so picture this: Aldous Huxley is freaking out about technology and how money runs everything. He wrote this book \"Brave New World\" to show us what happens when we get too obsessed with happiness and being part of the crowd. In this world, people are basically robots who just want to have fun and don't care about anything else.\n\nThey're controlled by this big boss guy called the World Controller, who makes sure everyone stays happy and doesn't think too much about the system. It's like a giant game, and the people are just pawns.\n\nThink about Marxism, man. Huxley is totally throwing shade at capitalism in this book. He's talking about how people are brainwashed into thinking that buying stuff and being part of the group is all that matters. They don't even realize they're being controlled! \n\nThe book is like a big warning about how capitalism can make people lose their freedom and individuality. It's like they're all trapped in a big, happy bubble, but it's all fake.  They're just following the rules and buying stuff, and they don't even know it.\n\nAnd get this, there's no real love or emotion in this world. People just hook up for fun and don't care about each other. It's all superficial and fake. The characters are so shallow, it's like Huxley is saying that capitalism is sucking the soul out of humanity.\n\nSo yeah, Huxley is basically saying that if we keep going down this path of technology and consumerism, we're all gonna become robots who are controlled by the system.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this gig I've got at this joint called University Park. Been here for a hot minute, like two and a half years, which is, like, four and a half semesters. \n\nGetting around this place can be a real pain in the neck, lemme tell ya. My freshman year, they stuck me in these dorms called East Halls, which were way out on the edge of campus, like, past the stadium and that big Bryce Jordan Center thing.  \n\nMan, going from my digs in Stuart Hall to classes way over by Willard, which is kinda in the middle of all this, could take, like, 25 minutes on foot. And forget about it if the weather was acting up, 'cause State College weather is, like, the worst.\n\nI was shootin' the breeze with this guy who graduated not that long ago, and he told me that back in the day, East Halls was like miles away from everything else.  There was just, like, this huge empty space between them and the rest of the school. Now, that space is filled with sports fields, new buildings like that fancy Creamery and that new health place, and apartments everywhere. It's like they just keep building and building, and it's getting harder and harder to get from one spot to another.\n\nSo, what's the answer? Well, I'll tell ya, it's gotta be bikes. Bikes are the way to go. But, ya know, it's not just about having bikes. The campus itself needs to be built with bikes in mind.\n\nLast week I was talkin' to this dude who got back into bikin' after, like, years. He told me he didn't know why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are the best,\" he said. \"For a while, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\"\n\nBesides bein' good for ya, bikes are the quickest way to travel. A little oatmeal and a little pedalin' can take ya 30 miles or more.  \n\nI'm livin' off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest thing I did this year was buy a bike. Every day, I gotta go to Thomas building for class, which is, like, a 25-minute walk from my place. But on my bike, I can get there in 5 minutes if I really pump those pedals.\n\nThe only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas, but it ain't always the easiest ride.  \n\nWalkin' ain't bad, but I'm just too busy to walk everywhere. If I didn't have my bike, I'd be walkin' all the time. Walkin' to Thomas every day would steal, like, 30-40 minutes outta my day. That's like, two and a half hours every week. Plus, all the other walkin' I'd have to do for other classes, appointments, and stuff.  Where'd I find the time for that?"

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "Yo, listen up! I'm gonna be a social worker, ya know? Like, I wanna help out those kids who've been messed with, the ones who've had a rough go. And I wanna help out families who are, like, totally outta whack. See, I've got this whole set of values, like, service to others, treating everyone with respect, being straight up honest, always trying to make things better between people, and never stoppin' to learn and grow in my field. These values ain't just some fancy talk, they're deep down in my soul, man.\n\nEver since I was a kid, I always wanted to help folks out. But I wasn't sure how, ya know?  In high school and college, I saw a lot of people runnin' from their problems, some even doin' messed up things to cope. I saw some stuff that made me wanna do something, so I went for a psychology degree. But even after I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009, I was still lookin' for my groove. Then one day, this friend of mine introduced me to this sixteen year old kid who was totally stressed out. Turns out, he was runnin' from his abusive parents.  The next day, I found out he called the cops on 'em!  I felt like I had to do something, so I went to his parents' house and talked to the cops. They asked me to talk to the parents since there wasn't much they could do for the kid. When I asked 'em about it, they were all nervous and makin' excuses, sayin' the kid was just manipulatin' them. It blew my mind! That's when I really started thinkin' about social work, about helpin' these kids with their family drama.\n\nAnother big thing for me is social justice.  Society always goes on about how important individuals are, but then they act like we're all supposed to be the same. It's like, if we're all so unique, why are we tryin' to fit in so hard? I'm my own person, and I ain't gonna let anyone tell me how to be. Through high school and college, I fought against injustice whenever I could.  Colored my hair crazy colors, wore what I wanted, pierced my ears, joined the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance, spoke up against racism and discrimination... I stand for social justice, man, and I'm gonna keep fightin' for it.",
            "Alright, so lemme tell ya 'bout this sleep stuff. See, there's these two ways of lookin' at why folks can't sleep, like, *really* can't sleep. One way is all about the body, like what's goin' on inside ya, genes and stuff. Call it the \"body's wired wrong\" theory. The other way's about the world around ya, your fam, your friends, where ya live, that kinda thing. Call it the \"life be a drag\" theory. \n\nSo, there's this thing called insomnia, where you can't fall asleep or stay asleep. It can come from all sorts of places. You got your basic sleep problems, like trouble fallin' asleep or sleepin' too much. Then you got your \"brain's screwy\" problems, where your mind's messed up and it messes with your sleep. And sometimes, it's 'cause of somethin' else, like a medical thing or something you popped. \n\nNow, the \"body's wired wrong\" folks, they say it's all about your genes, like if you got some bad sleep genes, you're doomed. And they point to this thing in your brain called the hypothalamus, which is like the sleep control center. See, there's these tiny things in your brain called neurons, and they send signals to tell you when to sleep and when to wake up. These neurons have these things called receptors, and if they ain't workin' right, you might have trouble sleepin'.  \n\nThey did this study with mice, see, and they found that these receptors can make you sleepy. If you mess with 'em, you might wake up, and if you mess with 'em the other way, you might sleep even more. So they're sayin' that maybe if people have messed up receptors, that's why they can't sleep.\n\nThe \"life be a drag\" folks, they say it's all about your life, your stress, your job, your fam, that kinda thing. If you're stressed out or worried or lonely, you might have trouble sleepin'. \n\nThey don't have any studies about mice, though.",

The problem is, when you stop pretending, you might mess things up with the people you've been fooling.  \n\nLike, some folks might not care that you lied, but others will be totally ticked off. It's a tough choice, gotta decide if you gotta protect yourself or keep your friends happy.\n\nThis whole gender-bending thing is extra tricky, ya know? Why do people want to pretend to be the opposite gender? In Viola's case, she's just trying to stay safe in a new land. She tells us, \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” \n\nBeing a girl in a strange place is risky business, so she puts on a guy costume. But now she can't hang with the other girls, and she's cut off from their support.\n\nTo make it even weirder, Olivia falls head over heels for her, thinking she's a guy named Cesario. She's like, \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.”\n\nAnd then there's Orsino, who kinda has the hots for Viola but she's hiding it. He's all, \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.”\n\nSo, maybe this play is saying that pretending can help us figure out our real feelings, even if it's messy. Olivia and Orsino are forced to deal with stuff they might not have admitted to themselves.\n\nIs Olivia into Cesario 'cause he's a guy, or is she secretly into girls?  Maybe she's just messing with people, showing how shallow people can be back then.\n\nShe ditches Cesario for Sebastian in a heartbeat and treats Cesario/Viola like family, like, \"A sister, you are she.”",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya 'bout this German place, South West Africa. Now, lemme tell ya, not all Germans were bad, but this one time, they got real messy. They did some awful things, especially to the Ovaherero and Nama people. It was bad news, real bad. But hey, Germany wasn't all bad, ya know? They had different ways of doin' things in different places. Like, when the Brits took over their East Africa bit, they found a bunch of smart folks who already knew how to read and write. Germans were even praised for how they did things in Kamerun and other places.\n\nBut in South West Africa, things were different.  Imagine this: instead of buildin' schools for the locals, they kinda left that to the churches. The churches tried, but they didn't have much help from the government. Now, the Germans did love to educate their own people though. They built fancy schools for them and helped the churches out with their schools too.\n\nThis messed things up for South West Africa. While other German places had lots of smart folks, South West Africa stayed mostly behind.  A lot of people couldn't read or write. Why? That's what this whole story is about. We gotta look at how the settlers and the bosses felt about the local people.\n\nThere's a whole bunch of books written about German schools back in the day. Most are in German, which is a pain, but some folks figured out what they were sayin' and wrote about it in English. They noticed that every place was different, like comparing apples and oranges.  One guy, Cohen, wrote about South West Africa and East Africa. He figured out that the big farmer crowd in South West Africa was a big reason why things were different there.\n\nSouth West Africa, even though it was kinda hot and dry, had a lot of white settlers. By 1913, it had more white folks than any other German colony except for East Africa.",

It's like musical Russian nesting dolls! \n\nIt's gotten so crazy that sometimes I don't even know what counts as heavy metal anymore.  It's got a little bit of everything in it! But that's what makes it so cool.  It's like a melting pot of sounds, you know?\n\nBut to really get it, you gotta understand where it came from. Heavy metal isn't just music; it's a whole vibe, a movement. It's all about that heavy, dark energy. More bass, more volume, more passion, more everything!  \n\nPeople think metal is all about drugs and craziness, and yeah, there's definitely some truth to that. Back in the 70s, everyone was experimenting, and that influence totally seeped into the music. But it's also about that raw, primal emotion that gets unleashed when you crank up the amps.  It's like tapping into something deep inside yourself.\n\nEven the lyrics are intense.  Like, remember that Beatles song, \"Helter Skelter\"?  It's dark, chaotic, and kind of scary. Some folks think it was one of the first heavy metal songs!\n\nMetal is definitely a journey, man. It's a wild ride, full of twists and turns.  But if you're brave enough to jump in, you might just find yourself blown away.",
            "Man, you wouldn't believe this dream I had! It was like, totally surreal, just like those paintings those fancy art folks do.  But get this, this whole dream thing was going on way back when this dude, Henri Rousseau, was painting.  He wasn't just painting regular stuff, he was painting his dreams, you know? Like, he wanted everyone to see his dreams.\n\nThis painting he did, called \"The Dream,\" is about this lady checking out some crazy stuff in a dreamland. But it's also about Rousseau's own dreams, like wanting people to think his art was awesome.  Problem was, he was kinda stuck.  He wanted everyone to like his stuff, but he also wanted to do his own thing.\n\nSo, here's the deal with this guy: he wasn't born with a silver spoon, he worked hard, like a real regular guy.  He wasn't some fancy art school graduate, he just loved painting.  He had this rough time, lost his wife and kids, and painting was his escape.\n\nHe wanted to be like those famous artists everyone was talking about, but they were all doing their own thing.  Rousseau was like, \"Hey, I want to paint something cool that people will like!\" But he also knew he had to stay true to himself. It was a real struggle, man!\n\nThis guy Gordon wrote this book about French artists, and he said Rousseau wanted to paint something so normal, so everyone would think he was cool.  But Matisse, he was all about being different and not painting anything boring.\n\nIt was like two different sides of the same coin, you know? Both trying to make it in the art world, but in totally different ways.",
            "Lotsa brainy folks have said that ethics and art are like BFFs, ya know? Like, truth and beauty are totally connected. It's like, what John Keats said in his poem 'Ode on a Grecian Urn', \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"  We learn a lot from school and stuff, but things like right and wrong, and what's beautiful, just kinda...click for us, ya know? \n\nKeats is onto somethin'. Ethics and art are more about explainin' why somethin' is good or beautiful, instead of makin' a big set of rules about it. Like, when people talk about why a painting is awesome, they might talk about the colors and stuff, but that doesn't really capture the *magic* of it. When you ask someone about their favorite book or movie, they'll say somethin' like, \"There's just somethin' about it,\" before they try to explain it. It's like, there's this extra somethin' that can't be put into words. \n\nSame thing with morals! You can talk about all the rules and stuff, but there's this deeper level that just *is*. Like Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" You can't explain it all, there's always somethin' left over.\n\nI think that's why art and morals are so connected. They both hit us in this deep, feel-good way that we can't really explain. Especially with books, they get right into our hearts and make us think about life and stuff. Like, they're kinda like life itself!",
            "Today's Germany is a real powerhouse, a united country with its own special flavor, from the mountains around München all the way to the coast in Kiel.  You can feel that same energy from Köln on the Rhine River, right through the heart of the country, all the way to Dresden in Saxony on the Elbe. It's no surprise that Germany's culture is so unique, since it came from all sorts of different groups and tribes. \n\nThere's this place called Germania, where the Germans came from. Nobody can really agree on where the name came from. This guy Tacitus said it was from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar was the first to use the word \"Germanus\" when he was writing about his battles with the Gauls and the Germanic tribes who kept crossing the Rhine (Caesar, 50-40 BC).  He took the word from the Gauls themselves, so they could tell the difference between them, the conquered, and the Germans, who they hadn't conquered yet. Some people think it means \"neighbor\" in Gaulish. In the first book of his Gallic Wars, Caesar writes \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.\" (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others think it comes from the spear they used in battle, called a \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or maybe from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" meaning the Germans were loud and noisy (Names of Germany).\n\nThis Roman guy named Tacitus, who wrote a book about the Germans in AD 98 called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" said he thought the Germans were the original people there and hadn't mixed with other races (Tacitus, 98). He said, \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\"\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Not the Romans, not yet anyway. They would send their armies into Germania to get stuff and fight some battles, but mostly they went back home to their big empire. So as the Germanic tribes started showing up in the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, traded their stuff they got from the land, and even fought for the Romans in their army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "Man, this thing was messed up. I stared at it for a minute, tryin' to figure out what was going on. My brain was workin' overtime, but I couldn't quite make sense of it. It was like lookin' at a bowl of spaghetti and tryin' to figure out the meaning of life. \n\nRemember that art book I got? \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\"?  It said somethin' about usin' a mental frame to simplify what you're seein'.  Like, instead of lookin' at a whole kitchen, you just focus on the bowl of fruit.  But this? This was too much, even for that trick.\n\nI mean, Picasso had his blue phase, Monet loved his greens, and those Renaissance guys went wild with colors. If I was gonna be an artist, this was my masterpiece.  My masterpiece in brown.\n\nI reached for my tool, my weapon of choice in this artistic battle.  Tightened my grip, visualized the flow, and...whacked the handle of the toilet. Water swirled, stuff broke off, drifted away.  Kinda peaceful, actually.\n\nBut then the darn thing wouldn't budge!  Stuck like glue.  \n\nMop in hand, tie feelin' tighter than a drum, I stared at this brown abomination.  A message, I guess, from the person who left it.  A message for the poor saps who had to clean up after 'em.\n\nA couple more flushes, a few more moments of zen, and I grabbed the toilet paper.  Wrapped myself up like a mummy.  Like a turkey goin' into the oven.",
            "You know, it's crazy how many young folks are gettin' wrecked behind the wheel. It's like, their brains ain't even ready for all that traffic chaos!  Those brainiacs over at the National Institutes of Health say it's a real thing. You got all these new drivers with zero experience, zippin' around like they own the place. No wonder they crash more, speed like maniacs, and end up flipping their cars!\n\nAnd don't even get me started on teen passengers! It's like they can't go anywhere without their buddies crammed in the car.  Some smart folks down at the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center did a study, and guess what? More passengers mean more fender benders. \n\nSo, some states are tryin' to fix things with these \"provisional\" licenses.  They put limits on when ya can drive and who you can ride with. But come on, that's just a bandaid on a bullet hole! The real problem is that young drivers are just too dang immature to handle the wheel! This psychologist, Marvin Zuckerman, says even 18 is too young!  He did some research and figured out that kids under 20 are all about that thrill-seeking life. So, makin' 'em wait a bit longer to drive, until they calm down a bit, sounds like a good idea, right?\n\nWe gotta stop giving licenses to kids who are just lookin' for a rush! Otherwise, those car crash stats are gonna skyrocket when all those Baby Boomer grandkids are old enough to drive.  \n\nHere's what we gotta do: schools can still teach 'em about driving, but nobody under 18 can hit the road.  They can get a learner's permit beforehand and still do all that practice stuff, like the 6 hours behind the wheel and 50 hours with a grown-up that California does.  We need to make these rules the same everywhere, so everyone's on the same page. It's a simple fix, and it'll save a ton of lives!\n\nBesides, this ain't nothin' new.",
            "So, I was checking out this old pile of movies at the Library of Congress, all these early Edison flicks. They had fifteen of these \"trick films\" from way back when, between 1895 and 1901.  These movies were all about tricking your eyes, using clever editing to make stuff look crazy. I figured I'd take a peek and see what was up.  \n\nMost of these trick films were pretty simple, stuck in one spot, like they were on a stage.  No fancy camera moves, just plain old shots, no getting up close and personal with anyone.  They'd just point the camera and shoot, over and over. It was like watching a magic show, but without the tricksy music.\n\nThese movies were all filmed inside, like a little stage set. The camera never moved, just watched what was happening in front of it.  Think of a play, but with less acting and more weird stuff happening.\n\nThey’d stick to long shots, sometimes medium shots, but never any close-ups. It's like they were trying to show you the whole darn thing at once, no matter how small the detail. It's like they wanted you to feel like you were right there in the middle of the action, but stuck in the front row.\n\nAnd get this, they'd make one idea, one trick, into one whole movie. That means a lot of these trick films were super short, like a minute or less. They couldn’t really tell a story, just show off a quick magic trick or make someone disappear.\n\nBut here's the sneaky part: even though they pretended it was all one shot, they secretly used multiple takes to make the illusions work.  Take this one movie, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" for example.  Looks like one shot, right? But if you look really close, you can see how they made the head disappear.  They were like sneaky ninjas of the film world!",
            "Alright, so there's this dude, John Taylor, from back in the day. This guy was all about being a farmer and keeping things simple. He was super into this whole \"Republicanism\" thing, ya know?  He thought the government should keep its paws off people's lives, especially when it came to stuff like farming.  He even got into politics for a bit, but it didn't last long. This guy was a straight shooter, always speaking his mind about freedom and how the government shouldn't mess with folks.\n\nHe believed that America had a real chance to do things right, 'cause we didn't have any old traditions messing things up.  We could build a government from scratch,  based on people's natural rights.  He was all about those rights, you know, like the right to life, liberty, and stuff like that.  He thought those rights were super important, and if one got messed with, they all started to crumble.  \n\nTo make this dream of a perfect society happen, John thought we needed a government that understood both the good and bad in people. He was pretty hardcore about this \"good vs. evil\" thing. He was like, \"Governments are run by people, so they're gonna have both good and bad parts.\"  He thought good governments protect your stuff, help out farmers, and keep big business in check.  He figured if you built a government on those ideas, it would work even if the people running it were kinda greedy.\n\nJohn believed everyone's always lookin' out for themselves, but that's not always a bad thing. It's only a problem when people get greedy and start taking advantage of others.  A good government, he said, needs to keep those greedy folks in line and make sure everyone has a fair shot.\n\nHe and a bunch of other guys back then were all about sticking to the Constitution.  They wanted the government to stay small and only do the things it was specifically told to do.  They thought a big government was too expensive and could easily turn into a dictatorship. But he also said that just reading the Constitution like it was a boring textbook wouldn't work. You gotta look at what the guys who wrote it meant by it, ya know?  He even thought the Declaration of Independence was more important, 'cause it talked about states being more independent from each other.",
            "Alright, so check it out. We had this thing, right? We were trying to get people to ditch their cars and use bikes or walk to campus.  See, Figure 17 shows that folks just stopped logging their commutes around the third month. Kinda bummer, y'know?  \n\nWe figured maybe it was the weather getting colder, less folks biking or walking. Plus, December is crazy busy with school stuff and the holidays everyone's outta here! Then January rolled around, and classes were back but still, not many log entries. What gives?  Maybe people just lost interest, like, all new projects have that initial hype, then it fizzles.\n\nSo, we cranked up the fun with \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, and guess what? More log entries!  So, the problem wasn't just the season, but keeping things exciting. \n\nBut here's the real kicker: everyone loves their cars! Driving's like, ingrained in our culture.  So, we had to bribe 'em with prizes, like gift cards to places like restaurants, coffee shops, even a massage therapist! Would've been awesome to throw in a sweet bike, maybe even a hybrid or electric car, though. Think that would've gotten people pumped!\n\nThe prizes were pretty decent, but maybe if they got better throughout the project, we coulda kept the momentum going. Think folks would've gone nuts for a brand new car!",
            "Yo, check it! So there's this thing called an ETF, right? It's like a basket of stocks, but instead of buying each stock individually, you just buy one ETF. Think of it like a shortcut to owning a bunch of companies at once.  \n\nETFs are pretty cool because they're cheaper to own than those old-school mutual funds. Plus, you can buy and sell them like regular stocks, which means you've got more options, like borrowing money to buy more (that's called \"margin\") or even betting against them (that's called \"shorting\"). Sounds wild, right?  \n\nBut hold up, there's a catch. You gotta pay a little fee every time you buy or sell an ETF, just like with regular stocks.  And while ETFs offer a bunch of different options, it's always a good idea to do your homework and make sure you're actually getting the diversification you think you are.\n\nLet's take this ETF called IHF, for example. It's got a bunch of stocks inside it, but we're gonna focus on the top 10 because they make up most of the ETF.  We wanna see if owning those top 10 stocks directly would be better than just buying the whole ETF.\n\nSo, we crunched some numbers, and guess what? Just owning those top 10 stocks could actually give you a higher return and less risk! That means you could make more money and have less chance of losing it.\n\nBut wait, there's more! We gotta make sure these results aren't just a fluke. We gotta look at the \"standard deviation,\" which basically tells us how much the prices of those stocks go up and down. If the standard deviation of those top 10 stocks is different from the ETF as a whole, then maybe owning the ETF is actually a better bet after all.",
            "Alright, so check it out, this poem by Poe, \"Dream-Land,\" is supposed to be one of his best, right?  Poe throws out this word \"Thulé\" a couple times, and some bookworm named Mabbott traced it back to some dude named Virgil. Virgil used it for this island way up north, beyond Britain, that the Greeks thought was like, the edge of everything. Virgil totally used the word, no doubt. But here's the thing: Poe was all about German writers, y'know?  \n\nThis whole \"Thulé\" thing makes me think Poe was hangin' with Goethe's stuff, big time. There's this author, Karl J. Arndt, who wrote this book about Poe and Goethe, and he totally compares their poems, saying Poe ripped off Goethe's style. \n\nNow, Goethe, he was a bigshot writer, known for this play \"Faust.\" It's got two parts, the first one came out in 1808, and the second one, right before Goethe kicked the bucket in 1832. Inside that second part of \"Faust\" is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It's about this king who loses his wife and goes totally bonkers. She gave him this goblet, and after she dies, he's drowning his sorrows in it. He gets all gloomy and decides to join his wife in the great beyond. He gives all his stuff to his kids but keeps the goblet. Then, he goes to a cliff, throws the goblet in the ocean, closes his eyes, and, boom, he's gone.\n\nThis king in \"The King of Thulé\" sounds a lot like the guy in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" maybe like a dark twin of Poe's own messed-up life and his love for drinkin'. \"Faust\" also got turned into a play by this dude H.P. Grattan in 1842, just before Poe used \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe only uses \"Thulé\" twice in his writing, once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land.\" It's like bookends, man. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about this gloomy place, Thulé. It's dark, lonely, he's haunted by dead friends, and everything's gray and colorless. It's like stepping right into Goethe's \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king's lost his wife, he's alone, and he's lost his fire.\n\nGoethe was a big deal, and Poe would have known him, especially since he was a fan of Tennyson.  Poe even said he admired Tennyson. And since everyone was copying Goethe back then, Poe would have definitely been exposed to his work.",
            "Okay, so picture this: there's this lady, Jennifer Palmer, who went to this store, D&D Markets, right? Well, she slipped and fell on a whole mess of applesauce, and now she's all messed up. She's saying that the store manager, this guy Paul Martin, totally messed up, and she wants to hit him where it hurts - with some serious penalties. \n\nNow, to get those extra damages, she's gotta prove that Martin wasn't just careless, he was downright mean. Like, he knew about the spill, twice, even, but he was too busy stuffing his face with dinner to clean it up! Can you believe that?  \n\nApparently, this wasn't the first time something like this happened.  There were like, tons of other people who slipped and fell at D&D that year. So, Jennifer's saying Martin should've known better. This whole thing makes you wonder if Martin was just being a jerk, right? \n\nIt all went down on a Friday afternoon. One of the employees, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the applesauce disaster.  But Martin was all, \"nah, I'm eating, deal with it yourself.\" Another worker, Mary Haddigan, tried again, but Martin gave her the same rude response.  Then, boom!  Jennifer went down, broke her back, and now she's suing.\n\nSo, the question is, was Martin really malicious, or was he just a clueless manager? We'll have to see what the judge thinks.",
            "Alright, listen up, cuz I gotta spill the tea about this Islam class I took back in the day, like, four years ago.  We were always arguing about whether Islam was, y'know, a bad religion or not.  And honestly, it feels even more important to talk about now than ever.  \n\nAfter 9/11, things got crazy. The media went from totally hating on Islam and anyone who wasn't, like, a cookie-cutter American to being all, \"Islam is amazing!\"  It's crazy how fast things flipped.  I mean, back in 2001, could you imagine a president named Barack Obama, a dude with a Muslim family history?  No way!\n\nBut this whole thing about Muhammad's life...that's what really messes with my head.  See, I thought he was this hardcore conqueror who just forced people to become Muslim.  Take over tribes, boom, they're all Muslims now, right?  But this biography paints him as a total martyr, like some misunderstood dude who was just chillin' and people came to him on their own.  It's like, \"Whoa, hold up!  That's not the Muhammad I thought I knew!\"\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the similarities between Muhammad and Jesus.  Like, the whole feeding the crowds thing?  Totally ripped off from Jesus, but somehow it's supposed to make Muhammad look good?  It's like they're trying to steal Jesus' thunder, man!\n\nThen there's all these stories about how people just randomly converted to Islam.  But they're all second-hand, like, \"So-and-so told me, who heard it from so-and-so...\"  It's super shady, y'know?  They're trying to make it seem legit, but it just makes it look more suspicious.\n\nThe whole thing just feels off, like they're trying way too hard to make Muhammad look like some kind of perfect dude.  But history tells a different story, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today even know the real deal about Muhammad.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin'.  This whole Jesus thing, it's gone kinda haywire, ya know? Like, back in his day, it was all about love and peace, right? But then things got all mixed up, and now it's like a big, messy party with everyone bringing their own snacks and rules.  \n\nSeems like folks are gettin' smarter these days, lookin' for somethin' real, somethin' true. The old ways, they ain't cuttin' it anymore.  The people who cling to the old ways, they're gonna be left behind, like a dusty record player in a digital world.\n\n\nMark my words, folks are gonna start lookin' back to the real deal, to what Jesus was all about.  They'll strip away all the extra stuff, all the layers that got added over time, and get back to the basics. It'll take a while, maybe even a whole heap of years, but it's gonna happen. It's like rewindin' a tape, goin' back to the start.  \n\nIt'll be a big shake-up, man. Churches might stay around, but they'll be different, like a classic car with a brand new engine.  Folks will be thinkin' alike more than ever, sharin' the same beliefs and beliefs, less of that \"my way or the highway\" stuff.\n\nHistory's full of these kinda things, y'know?  Like how the Romans hated Christians, then turned around and became Christians themselves.  Or how we went from slavery in America to Black folks leadin' the way. It's like a big ol' cycle, man.  \n\nThis time, it's religion's turn for a makeover.  People are gonna ditch the fancy words and get down to what Jesus was really sayin'.  They'll realize that some of his stuff, it's more like a story, a way of teachin', not somethin' to take literally.\n\nSo, where did we go wrong? Well, it all started with the Jews, way back when.  They were the first ones with this whole \"one God\" thing, and they had their own ideas about how to worship. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, though. They had their own squabbles, their own groups, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and those radical Zealots.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin' about this book, *The Jungle*. It's a real eye-opener, ya know? Shows ya how messed up people can be. Deep down, it's like they're all just greedy and selfish, only lookin' out for themselves. They don't care about nobody else, especially not the little guy.\n\nTake those factory owners, for instance. All they care about is makin' a buck, makin' their businesses bigger and richer. They don't give a darn about the people workin' for 'em or the mess they're makin'.  Sinclair, the guy who wrote it, he describes these factories like they're monsters, all dark and smokin', spewin' out pollution everywhere.  It's like they don't even see the people or the animals gettin' hurt, just dollar signs.\n\nAnd the workers? Forget about it! They're treated like dirt.  Workin' themselves to the bone, long hours, no breaks, and then BAM! Laid off with no warning, no help, nothin'.  It's a real dog-eat-dog world in there. \n\nThere weren't no laws back then to protect 'em, so the bosses could do whatever they wanted. Speed up the line, make 'em work in dangerous conditions - didn't matter.  It's like they were slaves, stuck in a system with no way out.\n\nSinclair makes it clear that these poor folks were just expected to deal with it. No help, no support, just pure exploitation. Unions were supposed to help, but they just ended up makin' things worse.",
            "So, like, picture this: authors, right? They're always tryin' to make ya feel somethin' when you read their stuff. Some ways are cooler than others, ya know? Like, F. Scott Fitzgerald in his book, *The Great Gatsby*, he's a master at this! He'll throw together words that don't usually hang out together, just to make ya feel a certain vibe. He also, like, uses symbols, ya dig? And he uses colors, man, like gold, green, white, gray, and red, to really make ya feel somethin'.\n\nSee, Fitzgerald, he builds up this whole thing about colors, like white and gray, and red and pink. And then, BAM! He uses 'em to make ya think about somethin' important in the story.\n\nHe uses white and gray to mean, like, bein' the same, ya know? Like, white is kinda fancier, and gray is more old-school and faded. He starts throwin' white and gray everywhere right from the start. Daisy and Jordan, they're always in white, man. Everyone's in white! Nick's wearin' white to Gatsby's party, Tom's got on a white shirt when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine, she's all powdery white. The only time people ain't wearin' white is when Nick's checkin' out Gatsby's party, and then it's all crazy colors, man.\n\nFitzgerald keeps usin' white and gray for all sorts of stuff, like the boring parts of life. Nick goes to work, goes down \"white chasms\" in New York, people's names at Gatsby's party are just \"gray names\" on his list. Catherine's apartment's like a \"white cake\" of buildings, all the same. He even describes regular people and places as white or gray, like Daisy and Jordan's childhood, or the gray cars and land in the valley of ashes.\n\nSo, after Fitzgerald's thrown all this white and gray around, he uses it to show that somethin' ain't important. Like, when he describes Daisy in white, wearin' a white car, all of a sudden she doesn't seem like a real person anymore, more like somethin' Gatsby wants, somethin' that's just there, ya know?\n\nFitzgerald keeps doin' this with Daisy, makin' her seem more like an object than a person. He uses that gray haze around her fur collar, and she's always in white dresses. It's like he's sayin' she's just a symbol of somethin', not a real person.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this sweet spot in San Diego County.  Weather's always primo, so they grow all sorts of yummy stuff: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. People here are crazy about organic food, like, there's a waiting list longer than my arm to get in on those fancy CSA programs.  And organic eggs and milk? Forget about it, those things fly off the shelves! \n\nFunny thing is, these organic farms aren't just about the grub. They're like mini-adventures! They'll give ya tours, let ya hike around, birdwatch, the whole shebang.  It's like a win-win, ya know? Makes the farmer some bank, keeps the critters happy, and gives folks a chance to learn something new.\n\nNow,  organic farming ain't always a walk in the park. It takes more elbow grease, 'cause ya gotta deal with pests and weeds the old-fashioned way. And sometimes, ya lose more crops than if ya were using all those chemicals.  But hey, it's better for the planet, right? Plus, ya get more critters hangin' around, which is always a good thing.\n\nSo, picture this: we got a piece of land near Potrero, about 160 acres of chaparral, grasslands, and oak trees. It's right next to the big Cleveland National Forest, and it's packed with all sorts of cool critters, some of 'em even endangered!  \n\nThis land has seen a lot of history, too. Native Americans lived here for ages, then came the ranchers and wood cutters. It's been a homestead for ages, probably used for grazing and firewood.\n\nI found this neat little organic farm nearby and figured, \"Hey, what if we could do something like that?\" So I looked into all the government programs out there to see how a small farmer could make it work. That's the gist of it!",
            "Hey, so listen up, 'cause this is important stuff, especially if you're gonna be doin' any deal makin' with folks from outta town. See, every group of folks, they got their own way of doin' things, their own quirks, ya know? You can't just go around sayin' 'all Russians are stubborn' or 'all Japanese are easy goin''. That's just plain dumb. \n\nIt's more like, try to figure out what makes 'em tick, what's important to 'em, and how that's gonna play out when you're sittin' down to talk business.  You're gonna see things through your own lens, sure, but try to look past that and really get a feel for their side.  It's like, learn their history, their hang-ups, the whole shebang. Don't go tryin' to change 'em, just roll with it, especially if you're the one with less to offer at the table.\n\nNow, this ain't just about countries, either.  Every company, they got their own vibe, their own rules. Some are all about workin' late, others are more laid back. You see it in how they dress, how they talk, even who they hire. Some companies give a hoot about charity, others say 'stick to the company plan'. Even here in America, you see it everywhere, from one company to the next, city to city.\n\nValues, those are the real deal. They're the 'why' behind everything. If they're all about savin' face or keepin' things peaceful, you better not go trashin' your boss or your own company just to win a deal.  And if they're all about hagglin' hard, don't expect 'em to fold easy.  \n\nSo, before you even step foot in that negotiatin' room, do your homework, learn the lay of the land. But don't forget, people are people, no matter where they're from. Get to know 'em, build a little rapport, that'll go a long way.",
            "\"A dumb guy once said, 'There ain't no God!'\" Y'know, that's what Psalm 14 says in the Bible, and it's where St. Anselm started his big talk about God.  Thomas Aquinas, another smart dude, seems to think the same thing.  Since both of these guys are trying to prove the same God--the one from the Bible-- let's just go with that, okay?  We gotta keep things simple here.  Now, both of them make some pretty good points, but neither one of them really gives us a super solid reason to believe in God.\n\nLet's start with St. Anselm. He's all about figuring things out through faith, like looking inside yourself to find proof of God. He says that since God's already in our minds, we can't really imagine him NOT being there.  It's kinda confusing when he explains it all fancy-like, but basically, he's saying we don't need to look anywhere else to find God--just look inside ourselves!  He's saying faith is like knowing something deep down even if you can't prove it.\n\nAquinas is way different. He thinks we can prove God exists just by using our brains and looking at the world around us.  No faith needed! This would be awesome for spreading the word about God, right?  People could just be convinced by logic instead of having to believe something without proof.  Aquinas has five big reasons why God must exist: stuff changes, stuff happens because something else made it happen, stuff just exists because something else caused it to exist, there are different levels of good and bad, and everything in the world is kinda organized like a puzzle. He says it all adds up to one thing: God exists!  It's like if you're missing a puzzle piece, you can still know it's there just by looking at the rest of the puzzle.",
            "So, there was this dude, right? Back in the day, like way back, around the 500s BC. He was a prince, but later everyone called him Buddha. This guy, he got all deep and decided to ditch the whole fancy prince thing and figure out life's big mysteries. He ended up becoming super wise, like, totally enlightened. And guess what? His ideas started a whole religion called Buddhism. There's a bunch of different types of Buddhism, but this one's called Theravada, and it's the oldest one, kinda like the OG.\n\nNow, Buddhism is like, super old—almost 2500 years!  Things have changed a lot since Buddha was around, even in places like Sri Lanka, where they still follow Theravada. They have this crazy water-cutting ceremony every year, and even though Buddha never mentioned anything about it, monks and regular folks join in. See, over time, Buddhism has changed a bunch, not just the little stuff like festivals, but even the big ideas.\n\nThere are a couple of important things to remember when we talk about Buddhism changing. First, there are \"internal\" changes, which come from Buddhists themselves, whether they're monks or not. Then there are \"external\" changes, which come from people outside Buddhism. Sometimes these changes are \"hostile,\" meaning they try to hurt Buddhism, and sometimes they're \"benign,\" meaning they don't really care about hurting or helping.\n\nAlright, so let's get down to the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three big things: the Buddha himself, his teachings (called the Dhamma), and the community of Buddhists (the Sangha). \n\nThe Dhamma is basically a bunch of super old Buddhist texts called the Tripitaka. Think of it like a three-basket collection. One basket has stories and teachings of Buddha (the Suttas), another has rules for monks (the Vinaya), and the last one has deep, kinda philosophical stuff (the Abhidhamma).\n\nThe Abhidhamma talks about things like no-self (Anatta), suffering (Dukkha), and impermanence (Anicca).  These ideas are kinda mind-blowing, but they're like the keys to understanding how to escape the cycle of death and rebirth (Sansara).  \n\nAnd guess what?  To escape Sansara, you gotta get rid of greed (lobha), anger (dosa), and delusion (moha).  You know, the usual stuff. Only when you're enlightened can you finally break free. \n\nThe Vinaya tells everyone, monks and regular folks, how to live a good life. For regular folks, there are five basic rules: no killing, no lying, no stealing, no messing around sexually, and no drinking or doing drugs. Monks have a whole lot more rules to follow. \n\nBut the most important thing in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths.  First, life is suffering (Dukkha). Second, suffering comes from wanting stuff (attachment). Third, you can stop suffering. And fourth, the way to stop suffering is by following the Eightfold Path.",
            "So, get this, the US and Mexico have this crazy history, right? Like, picture this: a super intense rivalry that lasted for, like, 57 years! From 1836 to 1893, these two were always at each other's throats.  \n\nIt all kicked off with the Mexican-American War, where the US basically stomped all over Mexico and snatched up Texas and the Southwest. Talk about a bully! There were tons of other fights, but they finally cooled down right before World War I. \n\nWhy did they hate each other so much? Well, they clashed over religion, culture, and all that jazz. Plus, they wanted the same stuff, which always leads to drama. It's like when you and your sibling fight over the last slice of pizza.\n\nThis rivalry thing isn't unique to them, though. Countries that live next door to each other often have beef, you know? It's like when you have a frenemy who lives next door and keeps borrowing your stuff without asking.\n\nThis guy, David Pletcher, said that the US had major problems with Mexico and Cuba, which makes sense because they're right next door. Meanwhile, other countries in Latin America have been chill with the US.\n\nReligion was a big deal back then. Americans were all about freedom and stuff, while Mexico was super Catholic. It's like when your friend is obsessed with Harry Potter and you're more into Star Wars.\n\nThings got heated because both countries inherited distrust from their past colonial days. It's like when your parents fight and you end up taking sides. \n\nThese two nations had tons of disagreements, mostly about borders. Bandits and outlaws would cross the border and cause trouble, which is not cool.\n\nEventually, Mexico realized it needed the US, and the rivalry died down. The US shifted its focus from taking land to making money, which was a win for Mexico.",
            "Fifteen years back, outta nowhere, I got hit with this illness, something I never even heard of.  I was a nurse, ya know, always thought I'd be a scientist or a reporter, maybe both, but I picked nursing 'cause it seemed safe, like a steady gig. \"Always gonna need nurses, people always get sick,\" that kinda stuff. But there I was, 46, single, no dough, and couldn't work anymore.  Still can't, fifteen years later.  Living on Social Security Disability, I got nothin'. Barely gettin' by, day-to-day's a struggle, feelin' insecure and down on myself.  Nothing's for sure anymore, except this: I wouldn't have made it without my family and some good friends.  Let me tell ya, when the world goes sideways, strong doesn't cut it. \n\n\nLife throws curveballs, big and small.  You can plan all you want, but some stuff's just too much to handle alone.\n\nBig government ain't the answer, that's for sure.  It's crumblin' apart, like a bad cake. But  maybe we gotta start trustin' each other again, helpin' out, not just fendin' for ourselves like cornered rats. Those folks back in the day, the ones who built this country, they didn't do it alone. They helped each other out, shared what they had. They had compassion, respect, and that's what got them through.\n\n\nSo yeah, be prepared. I am. Got my disaster kit, first aid stuff, water tablets, duct tape for the windows in case of a bio-attack, flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, canned food, the whole shebang. If you got the space and know-how, grow your own food, can it, get a wood stove - good stuff. But while you're at it, get to know your neighbors. You never know when you'll need 'em.",
            "Hey there, fellow shell enthusiasts! Ever wonder how those funky spirals on seashells end up looking the way they do? It's a real head-scratcher, right?  Back in the day, some smart guy named D'Arcy Thompson tried to figure it out using math, but it was like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube with your feet!  \n\nNowadays, we're using computer programs to model how shells change shape over time. Think of it like building a virtual seashell, tweaking the knobs and dials to see how it evolves. We're using these models to study a type of snail called Prunum.  We're taking X-rays of their shells to get all the juicy details, then feeding that info into a program called CerioShell. \n\nBasically, we're trying to figure out what the rules are for shell formation, kinda like figuring out the recipe for a perfect seashell cookie!  We're looking at how the whorls (those cool spiral parts) grow and change, how the aperture (the opening) moves, and all that jazz.  And get this, we're even checking out how all these changes happen over millions of years! \n\nIt's like a shell detective story, except instead of clues, we've got math and X-rays.  Stay tuned for more shell-ebrity gossip!",
            "Listen up, cuz I gotta tell ya 'bout this crazy situation in Indonesia.  For the last ten years,  the number of babies and new moms dying hasn't really changed much.  They're doin' alright on stuff like clean water and toilets, but when it comes to keeping the kiddies and moms healthy, they're lagging behind. We gotta figure out why this is happening 'cause just throwin' money at the problem ain't gonna cut it!\n\nNow, they're braggin' 'bout more moms have doctors at their births, but let me tell ya, that ain't the whole story.  They're countin' folks like midwives who ain't really equipped to handle complications.  You know what that means?  Too many moms bleedin' to death 'cause they didn't get the right help.  And get this, fewer kids are even seein' doctors when they got the runs!  And postnatal care?  Forget about it, that's a mess too.\n\nThey ain't doin' enough C-sections either!  Only 4% compared to what they should be doin'.  And guess what?  In the city it's 7%, but out in the sticks it's a measly 2%!  That's right, folks in the city get way better care than the folks in the country.  And it's even worse for the poorest folks. They're strugglin' to get any help 'cause they can't afford it.\n\nSo what's the solution?  Should they just focus on a few programs or fix the whole dang healthcare system?  Programs seem easier, faster, and more focused.  But here's the catch, if you focus on one thing, you forget about everything else.  You end up with a bunch of programs doin' the same thing and nobody knows who's doin' what.  It's a mess!",
            "Okay, so, listen up! Victorian books are all about the fancy stuff and the rich folks, right? But get this, there are these two books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" that are like, totally different. They're still from the Victorian times, but they're all mysterious and kinda spooky, which wasn't really a thing back then. It makes the characters way more interesting, 'cause you get to see their secrets and how they feel about stuff. \n\nTake this part from \"Oliver Twist,\" for example:\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese two books, they use mystery a lot, especially in dreams and stuff. In \"Oliver Twist,\" Oliver's dreams tell us about how he's feeling inside, what hurts him, and what he really thinks about everything going on. \n\nWhen they finally show what happened when Oliver got shot in chapter 28, he relives it like a dream, even though he's trying to get help. It shows how much control Oliver *doesn't* have. He's in so much pain, he doesn't even notice when someone carries him away. It's like his pain is so bad that it's all he can focus on. It makes you wonder who's really in charge here, because it's definitely not Oliver.  He just kinda accepts everything that happens to him.\n\nThe shooting is a big deal because it shows how broken Oliver is. It's like Fagin broke him, made him give up and accept this awful life. \n\n\nIn \"Wuthering Heights,\" they do this dreamy, mysterious thing too, but it's different. \n\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "Okay, so picture this: a couple years back, I was working with these little kids after school, helping them with their homework. I was pretty good at English and reading, so that's what I mostly focused on.  One kid, this little guy named Adrian, he was in like third or fourth grade, was having a real rough time reading. It was super weird, he knew some letters perfectly, but others?  Like, totally clueless.  It didn't make sense! He spoke perfect English, but reading, not so much.  So we were stuck in this loop, struggling, until one day Adrian's mom came to pick him up. She didn't speak a lick of English, just Spanish.   I was just starting to learn Spanish myself, so we managed to piece together a conversation. And then, BAM! It hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet well. I don't know if that helped him much in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now. \n\nI tell this story because it shows how messed up the language barrier can be in schools, especially here in California. It's not always as obvious as we think.  Even if a kid speaks English fluently, reading can still be a total nightmare.  Everyone knows this is a problem, right? So what do we do about it? For Adrian, it was simple: English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and sounds. But for kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. There's no one magic answer.  Dual language systems, immersion programs, private tutors, ESL classes, none of them are going to fix everything on their own. We need to mix and match! \n\nFirst off, dual language programs are awesome. They're not just for kids who speak Spanish, they're for everyone!  Studies show that kids in these programs do way better in school. There's this whole fear that it's a waste of money and resources, that most kids won't benefit. But that's just not true! If we made these programs the norm instead of the exception, everyone would win. \n\nSo how do we do it? Do we force all teachers to be bilingual?  No way! That's crazy. But what if we had bilingual helpers, tutors, whatever you wanna call them? That makes perfect sense, right?",
            "Alright, check it out.  You ever hear that, like, there's something way bigger than us out there?  Stuff you can't even wrap your head around?  Some folks go to church, some hit up the temple, others just try to figure it out on their own.  Lotsa people just go with what their parents told 'em, y'know?  But some folks, they say, \"Nope, that ain't for me!\" They think their own little world is all that matters.  We change our minds about stuff all the time, right?  What's important today might not be tomorrow.  But we're all tryin' to figure out who we are, what it all means.  We're lookin' for something to guide us through the darkness, somethin' to shine a light on the way.\n\nMy old man, he loved cardinals.  We were sittin' on the porch one day, rain comin' down like crazy.  Tin roof was bangin' like a drum.  We were smokin' cigarettes, him lookin' out at the storm, like he was searchin' for somethin'.  He was skinny, clothes saggin' on him.  Hair was gettin' thin, too.  Didn't look at me much, just stared at the rain.  I felt kinda lost, scared even.  Couldn't bring myself to talk about how much I was gonna miss him, 'cause sayin' it out loud would make it feel real, y'know?  So I just hugged him, moved my chair closer, and looked out at the rain with him.\n\nHe kicked the bucket in December, five days after I turned twenty-two.  Chemo and radiation, they didn't take away his pain, just stretched it out longer than the doctors thought.  What good was that, I don't know.  What kinda God makes that happen?  I didn't pray that night.  If there was a God out there, I figured he wasn't listenin' anymore.\n\nI didn't wanna see him die.  Couldn't bear to watch the life that made me slip away.  I wanted to remember him how he was, not how he ended.  Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, better than his family even.  And I knew he wouldn't want me there, watchin' him fade away.  So I hid in my bed for three days, waitin' for the news.\n\nDidn't get a call.  Not a peep.",
            "Let's talk about those spooky old books we call Gothic Novels. They're kinda like a mixed-up word puzzle, like \"old\" and \"new\" mashed together, you know?  This is what that book-smart guy Ian Watt said, anyway.  People have always gone back and forth about these Gothic stories - some say they're all smoke and mirrors, others say they're super deep and make you feel all tingly inside. \n\nIt all started with a guy named Horace Walpole and his story, \"The Castle of Otranto.\" He mixed up old-timey drama with what was happening in stories *now*.  Think of it like taking a bunch of cool old stuff and putting it in a brand new package. It was like, \"Hey, check out this spooky castle from way back when, but with all the new-fangled stuff we're doing in stories today!\"\n\nBack then, the word \"Gothic\" was kind of a dirty word.  It meant old-fashioned and not as cool as the shiny new stuff. But Walpole got clever and used it to make something totally unique.  He took all those old theatre tricks and fancy castle stuff and threw it into a story where you get inside the characters' heads.\n\nSo, what makes these Gothic stories so cool? Well, one big thing is this idea of \"Chivalry.\"  You know, knights, brave and honorable and all that.  This was a big deal back in the Gothic days, and Walpole wanted to show how awesome it was. He thought maybe the world had forgotten about chivalry and it was time to bring it back!  He had this character, Frederic, who was the perfect knight.  He had all the fancy clothes, the tragic backstory, and the brave heart.  It was like a fairytale come to life, but with a spooky twist.",
            "Alright, listen up, 'cause I'm gonna break down this whole \"supply chain management\" thing for ya. It's basically how we get stuff from the moment someone wants it, all the way back to the raw materials, and then how we make it and send it to them, you know, the whole shebang! This fancy name was cooked up in 1982 by this guy, Keith Oliver. He said it's all about planning, doing it, and making sure everything runs smooth so customers get what they need, fast and efficient, like clockwork! \n\nThere are six key parts to this whole supply chain thing: production, getting the stuff, keeping it in stock, figuring out where everything goes, moving it around, and sharing info. Managers use these six things to make sure customers are happy as clams.\n\nFirst up, you got production. That's the heart of the whole operation. It's all about figuring out when, where, and how to make stuff. Managers gotta know what people want, right?  So they look at the market, see what's hot and what's not. Once they know what customers crave, they decide what to make and how much. Then comes the \"where\" part - which plant is best for making what? Managers gotta think about volume, quality, and making sure customers are stoked. \n\nOnce they got the location figured out, it's time to schedule work and keep the machinery in tip-top shape. Production is super important, every little detail matters. Mess something up, and you could be lookin' at wasted time and money down the road. I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, and lemme tell ya, those places have processes for everything, from how employees dress to how they unload trucks. It's all about keepin' things smooth and runnin' like a well-oiled machine.\n\nNext up is supply. It's all about making smart decisions about what a company can do itself and what to hand off to other companies. Sometimes you got different parts of production for one product, each with its own tools, workers, and specialties. Managers gotta pick the best fit for each part of the process. Outsourcing is another big one - handing off work to other companies to speed things up, keep costs down, and be flexible. Basically, it's about gettin' the job done right while keepin' things cost-effective.",
            "So, picture this: Ellen Page, you know, the chick from Juno? She's on a street corner, holdin' up this cardboard sign with a crazy message scrawled on it. It says, \"Hitler is alive in Burma!\"\n\nNow, Burma, that's also known as Myanmar, right? It's this country in Southeast Asia run by some seriously nasty dudes who took over in 1962. Like, total power grab, coup d'état style. Anyway, back in 2007, these monks decided they'd had enough. They started these protests, the first in ages. They called it the \"Saffron Revolution\" 'cause they wore these orange robes, get it?\n\nAt first, the government was like, \"Whatever, monks, go protest.\" But then things got outta hand. People started joining in, and it turned into a full-blown brawl between the monks and the military.  They were bashin' up monasteries, throwin' people in jail, even killin' journalists just for showin' up.  \n\nThis ain't new, though.  Governments tryin' to squash anyone who disagrees? Been happenin' forever. Like, remember the Roman emperors? They thought they were gods, right? And those Japanese emperors? They're like, literally gods, sent to bring us... Motorola phones and, uh, hara-kiri? And don't even get me started on our own president, George W. Bush.  Seriously, he's buddies with Ted Haggard, the head honcho of Stupid People Worldwide, which sounds like a joke but it's actually a thing.  \n\nThen there was that Tiananmen Square thing in '89.  Students, intellectuals, everyone was out there sayin' \"Enough!\" But the government shut it down real hard.  They say 200-300 people died, but who knows?  And the Rwandan genocide?  Total nightmare. Hutu guys went on a rampage, killin' Tutsis and anyone who dared to stand up to them.  And, of course, there's Hitler's whole \"Final Solution\" thing.  Talk about messed up.",
            "So, get this, Duke Ellington was a total rockstar in jazz.  He played for ages and was always coming up with new stuff for his band.  Sure, he wasn't always the flashiest piano player, but he wrote some seriously awesome tunes that let everyone in the band shine.\n\nHe was like this genius architect, building these musical houses where soloists could go wild and improvise, while still keeping everything tight and groovy.  He knew how to make each player sound their best, and he could make the whole orchestra sound totally unique, like a one-of-a-kind instrument. That's how he came up with some of the coolest jazz ever!\n\nThis one song, \"Creole Love Call,\" is a perfect example.  He used a voice like a real instrument, adding texture and color without any words.  It's like he knew how to make every sound sing, not just the instruments.\n\nAnd get this, he wrote this song with this awesome call-and-response thing going on between the voice and the reeds.  It starts smooth and mellow, then gets all rough and edgy.  Then there's a trumpet solo that's all mellow and bluesy, and a clarinet solo that's super high and fast.  The whole thing builds and builds until it's a total explosion of sound!\n\nHe did the same thing with this song \"Hot and Bothered.\" He had this trumpet player, Bubber Miley, doing this awesome muted trumpet thing, and this singer, Baby Cox, scatting like crazy.  It's like they were trading ideas back and forth, creating this amazing mix of sounds.  And then there's \"It Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing.\" He had this trombone player, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, who played the melody on this muted trombone, and it was just killer!\n\nEllington was a total genius.  He knew how to make every sound count, and he knew how to make music that was both exciting and moving.",
            "She had this gnawing feeling, like something was missing. It started back when she was 14, just starting to figure out this whole being a teenager thing. And three years later, at 17, it was still there. She'd figured out she wanted someone, not some shiny object, but no boys really grabbed her attention. Some tried, going all awkward and lovey-dovey, but nobody clicked. She'd spend days pondering this, trying to figure out why she was so different. Theories popped up, but nothing stuck. So she just kept going, life unfolding with this big question mark hanging over her.\n\nHer days usually went pretty chill. Her folks were cool, calm, never fought. Arguments with her were rare, mostly about her being, well, her - loud, energetic, a total personality explosion.  \n\nBut today wasn't chill. She was bouncing around the house, trying to find some spark for her creative stuff, when a yelp from the kitchen stopped her dead. Her mom's voice, shaky and panicked. \"Mom?! What's wrong?\" she rushed in, heart pounding. There she was, sprawled on the floor, wincing with every breath. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need to go to the hospital,\" her mom gasped.  Her daughter wasted no time. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up!\" Her mom pointed, and the daughter, secretly thankful she'd been toughening herself up at the gym, scooped her mom up and got them to the car.\n\nThe hospital smelled like antiseptic and worry, but all her daughter could focus on was her mom. She practically dragged her inside, yelling for a doctor. Faces swarmed, someone wheeled in a bed, and her mom was whisked away. Her daughter sat there, anxiety buzzing.\n\nTurned out, her mom had been reaching for a vase on the top shelf, slipped off a stool, and BAM!",
            "Alright, so picture this: Researchers wanted to see if following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" – lotsa fruits, veggies, fish, and healthy fats – would keep ya heart healthy and help ya avoid strokes. They had this special score, called the \"alternate Mediterranean\" (aMed) score, to measure how well folks stuck to the diet.  \n\nThey already kinda knew that this diet was good for ya, but they wanted to focus on strokes this time. Think of it like comparing a regular soda to a diet soda. Both are kinda sugary, but the diet one's supposed to be better for you.\n\nSo, they followed over 74,000 nurses for 20 years. Every few years, these nurses filled out questionnaires about what they ate. It's like a super detailed \"What's in your fridge?\" survey. \n\nThese researchers made sure to check if the nurses' answers were accurate by comparing them to other records. They also took into account things like smoking, weight, exercise, and whether or not they took vitamins.\n\nThey found that ladies who scored high on the aMed diet quiz were way less likely to have heart attacks or strokes. It's like they were winning at the heart health game! \n\nSo yeah, this Mediterranean diet thing seems like a pretty good way to keep your ticker in tip-top shape!",
            "Man, lemme tell ya about this crazy time back in 2007. The whole country was screwin' up big time. Jobs vanished faster than a robot bunny after I kick it, and houses were worth less than a chewed-up chew toy. Even the big, fancy companies were crumblin' like stale cookies.  It was a mess, a real doozy!\n\nTurns out, all this started 'cause some folks in charge made some real dumb decisions. They pushed banks and companies to hand out these loans, called sub-prime loans, to folks who probably shouldn't have had 'em. These loans were like a ticking time bomb, see? And with these Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guys, they were packin' these bad loans into these fancy packages and sellin' 'em off like hotcakes.\n\nBut here's the kicker: when folks couldn't pay back those loans, BAM! The whole system went kablooey! Banks were broke, the markets were crashin', and everyone was lookin' around like, \"What just happened?!\"\n\nIt all started way back in 1999, when that Clinton fella was tryin' to stay in power. He wanted everyone happy, so he loosened up the rules on lending.  Little did he know, it was like lettin' a robot bunny loose in a china shop. Disaster, I tell ya!\n\nThen, these fancy new mortgages came along, all complicated and confusing.  Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations... they sounded like somethin' outta a sci-fi movie! But they were makin' folks borrow more and more money, and it was all tied up in the housing market. Like a giant web of debt, and when that web started to unravel...well, let's just say it wasn't pretty.\n\nThe housing bubble burst, and the whole system went belly up. Banks went bankrupt, big companies were sold off cheap, and the government had to step in and clean up the mess. It was a real rollercoaster ride, and it took years for things to start gettin' better.",
            "Alright, let's talk about exposition. It's that part of your story where you get to show off your writing skills, right?  You paint pictures with words, make your readers gasp in awe, maybe even shed a tear or two.  Or, you know, it's the part where your readers start yawning and hitting the \"back\" button faster than a cheetah on speed.  Even Dr. Merlin, the queen of storytelling herself, has been known to yell at her computer screen when she's drowning in a sea of \"tell, don't show.\"\n\nExposition, my friends, is not your best friend. \n\nYou already know the golden rule: \"Show, don't tell.\" But sometimes, even the best writers slip up and end up writing pages and pages of nothing happening, or worse, too much happening.  It's like that little voice in your head whispering, \"Just get all the boring stuff out of the way so we can get to the good part!\" But that voice is a sneaky little devil, always tempting you to overload your readers with unnecessary details about every character's childhood and every insignificant event.\n\nThink about it: exposition is like that scene in a movie where one character simply dumps a ton of information on another, like a cheesy version of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In writing, it's the author doing the telling instead of showing.\n\nHere's a simple example.  Let's say you're reading a story and suddenly you're told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain time and place, got married in a big fancy ceremony, and then, BAM! He's murdered right in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire life-changing saga to take up two pages, with both characters only getting two lines of dialogue each. You'd want to feel the love between them, see it in their actions and words, understand why the heroine is so devastated.\n\nA good introduction to the husband's character would allow you to connect with him emotionally, mourn his death with her, and understand the depth of their love. You'd feel invested in her pain.\n\nIn short, you'd want the author to give you more than just the bare bones of the story: \"They met, they married, he died.\"  You want the juicy details, the emotional depth, the \"meat on the bone,\" so to speak.\n\n\nSometimes, it's tempting to rush past details about your characters, like that night manager at the gas station who used to be in the Air Force, got married twice, no kids, loves fishing, secretly wants to own the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nGive your readers a glimpse into his soul!",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this crazy stuff I saw on the news today. These Columbus dudes, they were talkin' about this dude named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. Now, they showed his mugshot and man, that guy looked like he'd just crawled outta a horror movie. They didn't waste too much time on it, just a couple minutes, 'cause it was still a mess. They said he stabbed her a bunch of times and got arrested, but that was about it.\n\nThen they talked about this shootin' in Sharon Woods. Some 18-year-old named Travis Buyers got shot real bad. No arrests yet, SWAT team was all over it. Seemed like they skimmed over this one quick, though. Kinda makes you think, ya know? Like, if it was a white kid, they'd be all over it 24/7. But when it's a black kid, they barely mention it. Happens all the time, man. Makes me mad.\n\nNext up, they found a bullet hole in a Med-Flight chopper! Crazy, right? Turns out it was a .22 caliber, fired from a rifle. They're offering five grand for any info about the shooter.\n\nThen they teased us with some rain and thunderstorms comin' Saturday, said it'd be hot as heck all weekend. \n\nOh, and they talked about this robbery at a UDF. Some dude with a hoodie, dark-skinned black guy, they kept screamin'. Six-foot tall, 150 pounds. Kinda weird how much they focused on his skin color, don't ya think?\n\nFinally, they had this story about Rene Rodriguez, some big-time drug dealer from Texas. Got busted for slingin' weed to Ohio. They said he got 300 months, which is 25 years, but who knows why they said it like that. Kinda seemed like they wanted to make it sound scarier. And they mentioned he was Hispanic, but what's that got to do with anything?",
            "Man, being a brother is wild, ya know? It's like this super strong connection, like, you get each other in a way nobody else can. It's got all sorts of feelings mixed up in it, like love, pride, even jealousy and anger sometimes. You see yourself in your brother, more than anyone else. It's like lookin' in a mirror, except it's a mirror that shows ya the real you, the good and the bad. And when things get tough, that bond really shines, whether it's for good or for bad.\n\nBut here's the thing, all those feelings come with a price, you know? Like, you gotta deal with the mess they make. When you look your brother dead in the eye and see yourself back at ya, it's like you see yourself clear as day, not how people think you are, but how you really are. It's in your actions and what happens because of them that you see your true colors.\n\nThat's what this story, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" is all about. Two brothers, they're out there in this beautiful place, but they're on this crazy journey that's doomed from the start. It's all about pride and disappointment clashing, and in the end, only one brother walks away. You see it all through the main guy, Doodle, and how he sees his brother. He sees the world through his own messed up feelings, and that shapes everything he does.\n\nThe main guy, he's all about pride, from the start. He wanted a brother who was tough, who could keep up with him, who could do all the cool stuff he dreamed of. But Doodle, well, he was born different. He was weak, and it was clear he wasn't gonna be the brother the main guy had in mind.  It made the main guy angry, even made him think about doing something awful. But then Doodle smiles, and the main guy's heart softens. He loves his brother, even if he doesn't always show it.",
            "Yo, check it! So, our brains are like, totally wild, right? They're constantly buzzin' with info, like a super-charged computer. Back in the day, folks thought our brains were like wax tablets or papyrus scrolls, you know, the old-school stuff. Then, they started comparing them to books, and now, it's all about computers. But here's the deal:  these comparisons are cool, but they can also be misleading, so don't take 'em too seriously.\n\nImagine your senses, like your eyes, ears, and skin, as input devices, taking in all the crazy stuff around you. They turn all those sights, sounds, smells, and feels into signals your brain can understand. Then, your brain, it's like a mad scientist, throwing these signals around, analyzing them from every angle. It's like a mix of bottom-up and top-down processing, where your brain builds up a picture from the basic details and also uses what it already knows to make sense of things faster. Like, say you see a black box on a white background. Your brain zooms in on the details: the color, the shape, the edges. It's all bottom-up. But, 'cause your brain's a genius, it also uses what it already knows about boxes to figure out it's a box, not some weird white hole. That's top-down processing in action.\n\nNow, your brain's got this super important filter called attention. It decides what's important and what can chill. It's like a bouncer at a club, letting in the VIPs and keeping out the riff-raff. So, while your brain's processing every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, your attention filter's like, \"Nah, we don't need to know that level of detail.\" But, if someone yells your name in a crowded room, bam, your attention's all over it.\n\nAnd get this, your brain's got different memory banks: sensory, working, and long-term. Sensory memory's like a super-fast snapshot, holding info for a split second. Working memory's like your mental scratchpad, holding onto info for a bit longer, about 20 seconds or so. Long-term memory's the big kahuna, storing all your memories for years, maybe even a lifetime.\n\nSo, how's all this knowledge organized in your brain? That's a question scientists are still trying to figure out. Some think it's like a network, with different concepts connected like nodes. Imagine, \"chair\" linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Okay, so picture this: Aldous Huxley is freaking out about technology and how money runs everything. He wrote this book \"Brave New World\" to show us what happens when we get too obsessed with happiness and being part of the crowd. In this world, people are basically robots who just want to have fun and don't care about anything else.\n\nThey're controlled by this big boss guy called the World Controller, who makes sure everyone stays happy and doesn't think too much about the system. It's like a giant game, and the people are just pawns.\n\nThink about Marxism, man. Huxley is totally throwing shade at capitalism in this book. He's talking about how people are brainwashed into thinking that buying stuff and being part of the group is all that matters. They don't even realize they're being controlled! \n\nThe book is like a big warning about how capitalism can make people lose their freedom and individuality. It's like they're all trapped in a big, happy bubble, but it's all fake.  They're just following the rules and buying stuff, and they don't even know it.\n\nAnd get this, there's no real love or emotion in this world. People just hook up for fun and don't care about each other. It's all superficial and fake. The characters are so shallow, it's like Huxley is saying that capitalism is sucking the soul out of humanity.\n\nSo yeah, Huxley is basically saying that if we keep going down this path of technology and consumerism, we're all gonna become robots who are controlled by the system.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this gig I've got at this joint called University Park. Been here for a hot minute, like two and a half years, which is, like, four and a half semesters. \n\nGetting around this place can be a real pain in the neck, lemme tell ya. My freshman year, they stuck me in these dorms called East Halls, which were way out on the edge of campus, like, past the stadium and that big Bryce Jordan Center thing.  \n\nMan, going from my digs in Stuart Hall to classes way over by Willard, which is kinda in the middle of all this, could take, like, 25 minutes on foot. And forget about it if the weather was acting up, 'cause State College weather is, like, the worst.\n\nI was shootin' the breeze with this guy who graduated not that long ago, and he told me that back in the day, East Halls was like miles away from everything else.  There was just, like, this huge empty space between them and the rest of the school. Now, that space is filled with sports fields, new buildings like that fancy Creamery and that new health place, and apartments everywhere. It's like they just keep building and building, and it's getting harder and harder to get from one spot to another.\n\nSo, what's the answer? Well, I'll tell ya, it's gotta be bikes. Bikes are the way to go. But, ya know, it's not just about having bikes. The campus itself needs to be built with bikes in mind.\n\nLast week I was talkin' to this dude who got back into bikin' after, like, years. He told me he didn't know why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are the best,\" he said. \"For a while, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\"\n\nBesides bein' good for ya, bikes are the quickest way to travel. A little oatmeal and a little pedalin' can take ya 30 miles or more.  \n\nI'm livin' off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest thing I did this year was buy a bike. Every day, I gotta go to Thomas building for class, which is, like, a 25-minute walk from my place. But on my bike, I can get there in 5 minutes if I really pump those pedals.\n\nThe only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas, but it ain't always the easiest ride.  \n\nWalkin' ain't bad, but I'm just too busy to walk everywhere. If I didn't have my bike, I'd be walkin' all the time. Walkin' to Thomas every day would steal, like, 30-40 minutes outta my day. That's like, two and a half hours every week. Plus, all the other walkin' I'd have to do for other classes, appointments, and stuff.  Where'd I find the time for that?"

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum.

            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "Yo, listen up! I'm gonna be a social worker, ya know? Like, I wanna help out those kids who've been messed with, the ones who've had a rough go. And I wanna help out families who are, like, totally outta whack. See, I've got this whole set of values, like, service to others, treating everyone with respect, being straight up honest, always trying to make things better between people, and never stoppin' to learn and grow in my field. These values ain't just some fancy talk, they're deep down in my soul, man.\n\nEver since I was a kid, I always wanted to help folks out. But I wasn't sure how, ya know?  In high school and college, I saw a lot of people runnin' from their problems, some even doin' messed up things to cope. I saw some stuff that made me wanna do something, so I went for a psychology degree. But even after I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009, I was still lookin' for my groove. Then one day, this friend of mine introduced me to this sixteen year old kid who was totally stressed out. Turns out, he was runnin' from his abusive parents.  The next day, I found out he called the cops on 'em!  I felt like I had to do something, so I went to his parents' house and talked to the cops. They asked me to talk to the parents since there wasn't much they could do for the kid. When I asked 'em about it, they were all nervous and makin' excuses, sayin' the kid was just manipulatin' them. It blew my mind! That's when I really started thinkin' about social work, about helpin' these kids with their family drama.\n\nAnother big thing for me is social justice.  Society always goes on about how important individuals are, but then they act like we're all supposed to be the same. It's like, if we're all so unique, why are we tryin' to fit in so hard? I'm my own person, and I ain't gonna let anyone tell me how to be. Through high school and college, I fought against injustice whenever I could.  Colored my hair crazy colors, wore what I wanted, pierced my ears, joined the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance, spoke up against racism and discrimination... I stand for social justice, man, and I'm gonna keep fightin' for it.",
            "Alright, so lemme tell ya 'bout this sleep stuff. See, there's these two ways of lookin' at why folks can't sleep, like, *really* can't sleep. One way is all about the body, like what's goin' on inside ya, genes and stuff. Call it the \"body's wired wrong\" theory. The other way's about the world around ya, your fam, your friends, where ya live, that kinda thing. Call it the \"life be a drag\" theory. \n\nSo, there's this thing called insomnia, where you can't fall asleep or stay asleep. It can come from all sorts of places. You got your basic sleep problems, like trouble fallin' asleep or sleepin' too much. Then you got your \"brain's screwy\" problems, where your mind's messed up and it messes with your sleep. And sometimes, it's 'cause of somethin' else, like a medical thing or something you popped. \n\nNow, the \"body's wired wrong\" folks, they say it's all about your genes, like if you got some bad sleep genes, you're doomed. And they point to this thing in your brain called the hypothalamus, which is like the sleep control center. See, there's these tiny things in your brain called neurons, and they send signals to tell you when to sleep and when to wake up. These neurons have these things called receptors, and if they ain't workin' right, you might have trouble sleepin'.  \n\nThey did this study with mice, see, and they found that these receptors can make you sleepy. If you mess with 'em, you might wake up, and if you mess with 'em the other way, you might sleep even more. So they're sayin' that maybe if people have messed up receptors, that's why they can't sleep.\n\nThe \"life be a drag\" folks, they say it's all about your life, your stress, your job, your fam, that kinda thing. If you're stressed out or worried or lonely, you might have trouble sleepin'. \n\nThey don't have any studies about mice, though.",
            "Alright, so listen up! This here's the lowdown on this thing called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short. \n\nFirst off, lemme tell ya what it is. Basically, it's like your brain's got a problem understanding what it hears, even if your ears are just fine. Think of it like this: you hear the words, but your brain's gotta kinda scramble 'em around to make sense of 'em.\n\nNow, to figure out if someone's got CAPD, there are a few things we look for. It's like a bunch of red flags, ya know? Like, maybe they can't tell where a sound's coming from, or they get mixed up when there's a lot of noise goin' on. They might have trouble tellin' apart different sounds, or understandin' when someone's sayin' somethin' sarcastically.\n\nSo, what can ya do if you're a teacher and one of your students has CAPD? Well, there are a few tricks you can use to help 'em out. It's all about makin' things a little clearer and easier for their brain to process.",
            "So, this play, *Twelfth Night*, kinda makes you think about how disguises are cool for tricking people, but if you keep pretending to be someone you're not, you might lose yourself for good!  The problem is, when you stop pretending, you might mess things up with the people you've been fooling.  \n\nLike, some folks might not care that you lied, but others will be totally ticked off. It's a tough choice, gotta decide if you gotta protect yourself or keep your friends happy.\n\nThis whole gender-bending thing is extra tricky, ya know? Why do people want to pretend to be the opposite gender? In Viola's case, she's just trying to stay safe in a new land. She tells us, \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” \n\nBeing a girl in a strange place is risky business, so she puts on a guy costume. But now she can't hang with the other girls, and she's cut off from their support.\n\nTo make it even weirder, Olivia falls head over heels for her, thinking she's a guy named Cesario. She's like, \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.”\n\nAnd then there's Orsino, who kinda has the hots for Viola but she's hiding it. He's all, \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.”\n\nSo, maybe this play is saying that pretending can help us figure out our real feelings, even if it's messy. Olivia and Orsino are forced to deal with stuff they might not have admitted to themselves.\n\nIs Olivia into Cesario 'cause he's a guy, or is she secretly into girls?  Maybe she's just messing with people, showing how shallow people can be back then.\n\nShe ditches Cesario for Sebastian in a heartbeat and treats Cesario/Viola like family, like, \"A sister, you are she.”",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya 'bout this German place, South West Africa. Now, lemme tell ya, not all Germans were bad, but this one time, they got real messy. They did some awful things, especially to the Ovaherero and Nama people. It was bad news, real bad. But hey, Germany wasn't all bad, ya know? They had different ways of doin' things in different places. Like, when the Brits took over their East Africa bit, they found a bunch of smart folks who already knew how to read and write. Germans were even praised for how they did things in Kamerun and other places.\n\nBut in South West Africa, things were different.  Imagine this: instead of buildin' schools for the locals, they kinda left that to the churches. The churches tried, but they didn't have much help from the government. Now, the Germans did love to educate their own people though. They built fancy schools for them and helped the churches out with their schools too.\n\nThis messed things up for South West Africa. While other German places had lots of smart folks, South West Africa stayed mostly behind.  A lot of people couldn't read or write. Why? That's what this whole story is about. We gotta look at how the settlers and the bosses felt about the local people.\n\nThere's a whole bunch of books written about German schools back in the day. Most are in German, which is a pain, but some folks figured out what they were sayin' and wrote about it in English. They noticed that every place was different, like comparing apples and oranges.  One guy, Cohen, wrote about South West Africa and East Africa. He figured out that the big farmer crowd in South West Africa was a big reason why things were different there.\n\nSouth West Africa, even though it was kinda hot and dry, had a lot of white settlers. By 1913, it had more white folks than any other German colony except for East Africa.",
            "So, man, you know how music's like, super varied these days? It's wild! Like, there's tons of genres, right?  Rock, rap, country, jazz, folk... and each one has a million little categories inside of it.  It's like a big, crazy musical family reunion.  But you know what's really blown up? Heavy Metal.  It's been around for a while, but it's gone through so many changes, it's like it's its own universe now! \n\nIt's wild how much different heavy metal can be. One minute it's dark and intense, the next it's all fast and furious.  And get this, people have been breaking it down into even smaller pieces, like sub-genres within sub-genres. It's like musical Russian nesting dolls! \n\nIt's gotten so crazy that sometimes I don't even know what counts as heavy metal anymore.  It's got a little bit of everything in it! But that's what makes it so cool.  It's like a melting pot of sounds, you know?\n\nBut to really get it, you gotta understand where it came from. Heavy metal isn't just music; it's a whole vibe, a movement. It's all about that heavy, dark energy. More bass, more volume, more passion, more everything!  \n\nPeople think metal is all about drugs and craziness, and yeah, there's definitely some truth to that. Back in the 70s, everyone was experimenting, and that influence totally seeped into the music. But it's also about that raw, primal emotion that gets unleashed when you crank up the amps.  It's like tapping into something deep inside yourself.\n\nEven the lyrics are intense.  Like, remember that Beatles song, \"Helter Skelter\"?  It's dark, chaotic, and kind of scary. Some folks think it was one of the first heavy metal songs!\n\nMetal is definitely a journey, man. It's a wild ride, full of twists and turns.  But if you're brave enough to jump in, you might just find yourself blown away.",
            "Man, you wouldn't believe this dream I had! It was like, totally surreal, just like those paintings those fancy art folks do.  But get this, this whole dream thing was going on way back when this dude, Henri Rousseau, was painting.  He wasn't just painting regular stuff, he was painting his dreams, you know? Like, he wanted everyone to see his dreams.\n\nThis painting he did, called \"The Dream,\" is about this lady checking out some crazy stuff in a dreamland. But it's also about Rousseau's own dreams, like wanting people to think his art was awesome.  Problem was, he was kinda stuck.  He wanted everyone to like his stuff, but he also wanted to do his own thing.\n\nSo, here's the deal with this guy: he wasn't born with a silver spoon, he worked hard, like a real regular guy.  He wasn't some fancy art school graduate, he just loved painting.  He had this rough time, lost his wife and kids, and painting was his escape.\n\nHe wanted to be like those famous artists everyone was talking about, but they were all doing their own thing.  Rousseau was like, \"Hey, I want to paint something cool that people will like!\" But he also knew he had to stay true to himself. It was a real struggle, man!\n\nThis guy Gordon wrote this book about French artists, and he said Rousseau wanted to paint something so normal, so everyone would think he was cool.  But Matisse, he was all about being different and not painting anything boring.\n\nIt was like two different sides of the same coin, you know? Both trying to make it in the art world, but in totally different ways.",
            "Lotsa brainy folks have said that ethics and art are like BFFs, ya know? Like, truth and beauty are totally connected. It's like, what John Keats said in his poem 'Ode on a Grecian Urn', \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"  We learn a lot from school and stuff, but things like right and wrong, and what's beautiful, just kinda...click for us, ya know? \n\nKeats is onto somethin'. Ethics and art are more about explainin' why somethin' is good or beautiful, instead of makin' a big set of rules about it. Like, when people talk about why a painting is awesome, they might talk about the colors and stuff, but that doesn't really capture the *magic* of it. When you ask someone about their favorite book or movie, they'll say somethin' like, \"There's just somethin' about it,\" before they try to explain it. It's like, there's this extra somethin' that can't be put into words. \n\nSame thing with morals! You can talk about all the rules and stuff, but there's this deeper level that just *is*. Like Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\" You can't explain it all, there's always somethin' left over.\n\nI think that's why art and morals are so connected. They both hit us in this deep, feel-good way that we can't really explain. Especially with books, they get right into our hearts and make us think about life and stuff. Like, they're kinda like life itself!",
            "Today's Germany is a real powerhouse, a united country with its own special flavor, from the mountains around München all the way to the coast in Kiel.  You can feel that same energy from Köln on the Rhine River, right through the heart of the country, all the way to Dresden in Saxony on the Elbe. It's no surprise that Germany's culture is so unique, since it came from all sorts of different groups and tribes. \n\nThere's this place called Germania, where the Germans came from. Nobody can really agree on where the name came from. This guy Tacitus said it was from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar was the first to use the word \"Germanus\" when he was writing about his battles with the Gauls and the Germanic tribes who kept crossing the Rhine (Caesar, 50-40 BC).  He took the word from the Gauls themselves, so they could tell the difference between them, the conquered, and the Germans, who they hadn't conquered yet. Some people think it means \"neighbor\" in Gaulish. In the first book of his Gallic Wars, Caesar writes \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.\" (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others think it comes from the spear they used in battle, called a \"ger\" (O.E.D, 2010), or maybe from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" meaning the Germans were loud and noisy (Names of Germany).\n\nThis Roman guy named Tacitus, who wrote a book about the Germans in AD 98 called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" said he thought the Germans were the original people there and hadn't mixed with other races (Tacitus, 98). He said, \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\"\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Not the Romans, not yet anyway. They would send their armies into Germania to get stuff and fight some battles, but mostly they went back home to their big empire. So as the Germanic tribes started showing up in the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire, traded their stuff they got from the land, and even fought for the Romans in their army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",

It said somethin' about usin' a mental frame to simplify what you're seein'.  Like, instead of lookin' at a whole kitchen, you just focus on the bowl of fruit.  But this? This was too much, even for that trick.\n\nI mean, Picasso had his blue phase, Monet loved his greens, and those Renaissance guys went wild with colors. If I was gonna be an artist, this was my masterpiece.  My masterpiece in brown.\n\nI reached for my tool, my weapon of choice in this artistic battle.  Tightened my grip, visualized the flow, and...whacked the handle of the toilet. Water swirled, stuff broke off, drifted away.  Kinda peaceful, actually.\n\nBut then the darn thing wouldn't budge!

But come on, that's just a bandaid on a bullet hole! The real problem is that young drivers are just too dang immature to handle the wheel! This psychologist, Marvin Zuckerman, says even 18 is too young!  He did some research and figured out that kids under 20 are all about that thrill-seeking life.

Otherwise, those car crash stats are gonna skyrocket when all those Baby Boomer grandkids are old enough to drive.  \n\nHere's what we gotta do: schools can still teach 'em about driving, but nobody under 18 can hit the road.  They can get a learner's permit beforehand and still do all that practice stuff, like the 6 hours behind the wheel and 50 hours with a grown-up that California does.

            "So, I was checking out this old pile of movies at the Library of Congress, all these early Edison flicks. They had fifteen of these \"trick films\" from way back when, between 1895 and 1901.  These movies were all about tricking your eyes, using clever editing to make stuff look crazy. I figured I'd take a peek and see what was up.  \n\nMost of these trick films were pretty simple, stuck in one spot, like they were on a stage.  No fancy camera moves, just plain old shots, no getting up close and personal with anyone.  They'd just point the camera and shoot, over and over. It was like watching a magic show, but without the tricksy music.\n\nThese movies were all filmed inside, like a little stage set. The camera never moved, just watched what was happening in front of it.  Think of a play, but with less acting and more weird stuff happening.\n\nThey’d stick to long shots, sometimes medium shots, but never any close-ups. It's like they were trying to show you the whole darn thing at once, no matter how small the detail. It's like they wanted you to feel like you were right there in the middle of the action, but stuck in the front row.\n\nAnd get this, they'd make one idea, one trick, into one whole movie. That means a lot of these trick films were super short, like a minute or less. They couldn’t really tell a story, just show off a quick magic trick or make someone disappear.\n\nBut here's the sneaky part: even though they pretended it was all one shot, they secretly used multiple takes to make the illusions work.  Take this one movie, \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots,\" for example.  Looks like one shot, right? But if you look really close, you can see how they made the head disappear.  They were like sneaky ninjas of the film world!",

He was super into this whole \"Republicanism\" thing, ya know?  He thought the government should keep its paws off people's lives, especially when it came to stuff like farming.  He even got into politics for a bit, but it didn't last long. This guy was a straight shooter, always speaking his mind about freedom and how the government shouldn't mess with folks.\n\nHe believed that America had a real chance to do things right, 'cause we didn't have any old traditions messing things up.  We could build a government from scratch,  based on people's natural rights.  He was all about those rights, you know, like the right to life, liberty, and stuff like that.  He thought those rights were super important, and if one got messed with, they all started to crumble.  \n\nTo make this dream of a perfect society happen, John thought we needed a government that understood both the good and bad in people. He was pretty hardcore about this \"good vs. evil\" thing. He was like, \"Governments are run by people, so they're gonna have both good and bad parts.\"  He thought good governments protect your stuff, help out farmers, and keep big business in check.  He figured if you built a government on those ideas, it would work even if the people running it were kinda greedy.\n\nJohn believed everyone's always lookin' out for themselves, but that's not always a bad thing. It's only a problem when people get greedy and start taking advantage of others.  A good government, he said, needs to keep those greedy folks in line and make sure everyone has a fair shot.\n\nHe and a bunch of other guys back then were all about sticking to the Constitution.  They wanted the government to stay small and only do the things it was specifically told to do.  They thought a big government was too expensive and could easily turn into a dictatorship. But he also said that just reading the Constitution like it was a boring textbook wouldn't work. You gotta look at what the guys who wrote it meant by it, ya know?  He even thought the Declaration of Independence was more important, 'cause it talked about states being more independent from each other.",
            "Alright, so check it out. We had this thing, right? We were trying to get people to ditch their cars and use bikes or walk to campus.  See, Figure 17 shows that folks just stopped logging their commutes around the third month. Kinda bummer, y'know?  \n\nWe figured maybe it was the weather getting colder, less folks biking or walking. Plus, December is crazy busy with school stuff and the holidays everyone's outta here! Then January rolled around, and classes were back but still, not many log entries. What gives?  Maybe people just lost interest, like, all new projects have that initial hype, then it fizzles.\n\nSo, we cranked up the fun with \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, and guess what? More log entries!  So, the problem wasn't just the season, but keeping things exciting. \n\nBut here's the real kicker: everyone loves their cars! Driving's like, ingrained in our culture.  So, we had to bribe 'em with prizes, like gift cards to places like restaurants, coffee shops, even a massage therapist! Would've been awesome to throw in a sweet bike, maybe even a hybrid or electric car, though. Think that would've gotten people pumped!\n\nThe prizes were pretty decent, but maybe if they got better throughout the project, we coulda kept the momentum going. Think folks would've gone nuts for a brand new car!",
            "Yo, check it! So there's this thing called an ETF, right? It's like a basket of stocks, but instead of buying each stock individually, you just buy one ETF. Think of it like a shortcut to owning a bunch of companies at once.  \n\nETFs are pretty cool because they're cheaper to own than those old-school mutual funds. Plus, you can buy and sell them like regular stocks, which means you've got more options, like borrowing money to buy more (that's called \"margin\") or even betting against them (that's called \"shorting\"). Sounds wild, right?  \n\nBut hold up, there's a catch. You gotta pay a little fee every time you buy or sell an ETF, just like with regular stocks.  And while ETFs offer a bunch of different options, it's always a good idea to do your homework and make sure you're actually getting the diversification you think you are.\n\nLet's take this ETF called IHF, for example. It's got a bunch of stocks inside it, but we're gonna focus on the top 10 because they make up most of the ETF.  We wanna see if owning those top 10 stocks directly would be better than just buying the whole ETF.\n\nSo, we crunched some numbers, and guess what? Just owning those top 10 stocks could actually give you a higher return and less risk! That means you could make more money and have less chance of losing it.\n\nBut wait, there's more! We gotta make sure these results aren't just a fluke. We gotta look at the \"standard deviation,\" which basically tells us how much the prices of those stocks go up and down. If the standard deviation of those top 10 stocks is different from the ETF as a whole, then maybe owning the ETF is actually a better bet after all.",
            "Alright, so check it out, this poem by Poe, \"Dream-Land,\" is supposed to be one of his best, right?  Poe throws out this word \"Thulé\" a couple times, and some bookworm named Mabbott traced it back to some dude named Virgil. Virgil used it for this island way up north, beyond Britain, that the Greeks thought was like, the edge of everything. Virgil totally used the word, no doubt. But here's the thing: Poe was all about German writers, y'know?  \n\nThis whole \"Thulé\" thing makes me think Poe was hangin' with Goethe's stuff, big time. There's this author, Karl J. Arndt, who wrote this book about Poe and Goethe, and he totally compares their poems, saying Poe ripped off Goethe's style. \n\nNow, Goethe, he was a bigshot writer, known for this play \"Faust.\" It's got two parts, the first one came out in 1808, and the second one, right before Goethe kicked the bucket in 1832. Inside that second part of \"Faust\" is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" It's about this king who loses his wife and goes totally bonkers. She gave him this goblet, and after she dies, he's drowning his sorrows in it. He gets all gloomy and decides to join his wife in the great beyond. He gives all his stuff to his kids but keeps the goblet. Then, he goes to a cliff, throws the goblet in the ocean, closes his eyes, and, boom, he's gone.\n\nThis king in \"The King of Thulé\" sounds a lot like the guy in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" maybe like a dark twin of Poe's own messed-up life and his love for drinkin'. \"Faust\" also got turned into a play by this dude H.P. Grattan in 1842, just before Poe used \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe only uses \"Thulé\" twice in his writing, once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and twice in \"Dream-Land.\" It's like bookends, man. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker talks about this gloomy place, Thulé. It's dark, lonely, he's haunted by dead friends, and everything's gray and colorless. It's like stepping right into Goethe's \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king's lost his wife, he's alone, and he's lost his fire.\n\nGoethe was a big deal, and Poe would have known him, especially since he was a fan of Tennyson.  Poe even said he admired Tennyson. And since everyone was copying Goethe back then, Poe would have definitely been exposed to his work.",
            "Okay, so picture this: there's this lady, Jennifer Palmer, who went to this store, D&D Markets, right? Well, she slipped and fell on a whole mess of applesauce, and now she's all messed up. She's saying that the store manager, this guy Paul Martin, totally messed up, and she wants to hit him where it hurts - with some serious penalties. \n\nNow, to get those extra damages, she's gotta prove that Martin wasn't just careless, he was downright mean. Like, he knew about the spill, twice, even, but he was too busy stuffing his face with dinner to clean it up! Can you believe that?  \n\nApparently, this wasn't the first time something like this happened.  There were like, tons of other people who slipped and fell at D&D that year. So, Jennifer's saying Martin should've known better. This whole thing makes you wonder if Martin was just being a jerk, right? \n\nIt all went down on a Friday afternoon. One of the employees, Rich Wayne, told Martin about the applesauce disaster.  But Martin was all, \"nah, I'm eating, deal with it yourself.\" Another worker, Mary Haddigan, tried again, but Martin gave her the same rude response.  Then, boom!  Jennifer went down, broke her back, and now she's suing.\n\nSo, the question is, was Martin really malicious, or was he just a clueless manager? We'll have to see what the judge thinks.",
            "Alright, listen up, cuz I gotta spill the tea about this Islam class I took back in the day, like, four years ago.  We were always arguing about whether Islam was, y'know, a bad religion or not.  And honestly, it feels even more important to talk about now than ever.  \n\nAfter 9/11, things got crazy. The media went from totally hating on Islam and anyone who wasn't, like, a cookie-cutter American to being all, \"Islam is amazing!\"  It's crazy how fast things flipped.  I mean, back in 2001, could you imagine a president named Barack Obama, a dude with a Muslim family history?  No way!\n\nBut this whole thing about Muhammad's life...that's what really messes with my head.  See, I thought he was this hardcore conqueror who just forced people to become Muslim.  Take over tribes, boom, they're all Muslims now, right?  But this biography paints him as a total martyr, like some misunderstood dude who was just chillin' and people came to him on their own.  It's like, \"Whoa, hold up!  That's not the Muhammad I thought I knew!\"\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the similarities between Muhammad and Jesus.  Like, the whole feeding the crowds thing?  Totally ripped off from Jesus, but somehow it's supposed to make Muhammad look good?  It's like they're trying to steal Jesus' thunder, man!\n\nThen there's all these stories about how people just randomly converted to Islam.  But they're all second-hand, like, \"So-and-so told me, who heard it from so-and-so...\"  It's super shady, y'know?  They're trying to make it seem legit, but it just makes it look more suspicious.\n\nThe whole thing just feels off, like they're trying way too hard to make Muhammad look like some kind of perfect dude.  But history tells a different story, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today even know the real deal about Muhammad.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin'.  This whole Jesus thing, it's gone kinda haywire, ya know? Like, back in his day, it was all about love and peace, right? But then things got all mixed up, and now it's like a big, messy party with everyone bringing their own snacks and rules.  \n\nSeems like folks are gettin' smarter these days, lookin' for somethin' real, somethin' true. The old ways, they ain't cuttin' it anymore.  The people who cling to the old ways, they're gonna be left behind, like a dusty record player in a digital world.\n\n\nMark my words, folks are gonna start lookin' back to the real deal, to what Jesus was all about.  They'll strip away all the extra stuff, all the layers that got added over time, and get back to the basics. It'll take a while, maybe even a whole heap of years, but it's gonna happen. It's like rewindin' a tape, goin' back to the start.  \n\nIt'll be a big shake-up, man. Churches might stay around, but they'll be different, like a classic car with a brand new engine.  Folks will be thinkin' alike more than ever, sharin' the same beliefs and beliefs, less of that \"my way or the highway\" stuff.\n\nHistory's full of these kinda things, y'know?  Like how the Romans hated Christians, then turned around and became Christians themselves.  Or how we went from slavery in America to Black folks leadin' the way. It's like a big ol' cycle, man.  \n\nThis time, it's religion's turn for a makeover.  People are gonna ditch the fancy words and get down to what Jesus was really sayin'.  They'll realize that some of his stuff, it's more like a story, a way of teachin', not somethin' to take literally.\n\nSo, where did we go wrong? Well, it all started with the Jews, way back when.  They were the first ones with this whole \"one God\" thing, and they had their own ideas about how to worship. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, though. They had their own squabbles, their own groups, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and those radical Zealots.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin' about this book, *The Jungle*. It's a real eye-opener, ya know? Shows ya how messed up people can be. Deep down, it's like they're all just greedy and selfish, only lookin' out for themselves. They don't care about nobody else, especially not the little guy.\n\nTake those factory owners, for instance. All they care about is makin' a buck, makin' their businesses bigger and richer. They don't give a darn about the people workin' for 'em or the mess they're makin'.  Sinclair, the guy who wrote it, he describes these factories like they're monsters, all dark and smokin', spewin' out pollution everywhere.  It's like they don't even see the people or the animals gettin' hurt, just dollar signs.\n\nAnd the workers? Forget about it! They're treated like dirt.  Workin' themselves to the bone, long hours, no breaks, and then BAM! Laid off with no warning, no help, nothin'.  It's a real dog-eat-dog world in there. \n\nThere weren't no laws back then to protect 'em, so the bosses could do whatever they wanted. Speed up the line, make 'em work in dangerous conditions - didn't matter.  It's like they were slaves, stuck in a system with no way out.\n\nSinclair makes it clear that these poor folks were just expected to deal with it. No help, no support, just pure exploitation. Unions were supposed to help, but they just ended up makin' things worse.",
            "So, like, picture this: authors, right? They're always tryin' to make ya feel somethin' when you read their stuff. Some ways are cooler than others, ya know? Like, F. Scott Fitzgerald in his book, *The Great Gatsby*, he's a master at this! He'll throw together words that don't usually hang out together, just to make ya feel a certain vibe. He also, like, uses symbols, ya dig? And he uses colors, man, like gold, green, white, gray, and red, to really make ya feel somethin'.\n\nSee, Fitzgerald, he builds up this whole thing about colors, like white and gray, and red and pink. And then, BAM! He uses 'em to make ya think about somethin' important in the story.\n\nHe uses white and gray to mean, like, bein' the same, ya know? Like, white is kinda fancier, and gray is more old-school and faded. He starts throwin' white and gray everywhere right from the start. Daisy and Jordan, they're always in white, man. Everyone's in white! Nick's wearin' white to Gatsby's party, Tom's got on a white shirt when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine, she's all powdery white. The only time people ain't wearin' white is when Nick's checkin' out Gatsby's party, and then it's all crazy colors, man.\n\nFitzgerald keeps usin' white and gray for all sorts of stuff, like the boring parts of life. Nick goes to work, goes down \"white chasms\" in New York, people's names at Gatsby's party are just \"gray names\" on his list. Catherine's apartment's like a \"white cake\" of buildings, all the same. He even describes regular people and places as white or gray, like Daisy and Jordan's childhood, or the gray cars and land in the valley of ashes.\n\nSo, after Fitzgerald's thrown all this white and gray around, he uses it to show that somethin' ain't important. Like, when he describes Daisy in white, wearin' a white car, all of a sudden she doesn't seem like a real person anymore, more like somethin' Gatsby wants, somethin' that's just there, ya know?\n\nFitzgerald keeps doin' this with Daisy, makin' her seem more like an object than a person. He uses that gray haze around her fur collar, and she's always in white dresses. It's like he's sayin' she's just a symbol of somethin', not a real person.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this sweet spot in San Diego County.  Weather's always primo, so they grow all sorts of yummy stuff: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. People here are crazy about organic food, like, there's a waiting list longer than my arm to get in on those fancy CSA programs.  And organic eggs and milk? Forget about it, those things fly off the shelves! \n\nFunny thing is, these organic farms aren't just about the grub. They're like mini-adventures! They'll give ya tours, let ya hike around, birdwatch, the whole shebang.  It's like a win-win, ya know? Makes the farmer some bank, keeps the critters happy, and gives folks a chance to learn something new.\n\nNow,  organic farming ain't always a walk in the park. It takes more elbow grease, 'cause ya gotta deal with pests and weeds the old-fashioned way. And sometimes, ya lose more crops than if ya were using all those chemicals.  But hey, it's better for the planet, right? Plus, ya get more critters hangin' around, which is always a good thing.\n\nSo, picture this: we got a piece of land near Potrero, about 160 acres of chaparral, grasslands, and oak trees. It's right next to the big Cleveland National Forest, and it's packed with all sorts of cool critters, some of 'em even endangered!  \n\nThis land has seen a lot of history, too. Native Americans lived here for ages, then came the ranchers and wood cutters. It's been a homestead for ages, probably used for grazing and firewood.\n\nI found this neat little organic farm nearby and figured, \"Hey, what if we could do something like that?\" So I looked into all the government programs out there to see how a small farmer could make it work. That's the gist of it!",
            "Hey, so listen up, 'cause this is important stuff, especially if you're gonna be doin' any deal makin' with folks from outta town. See, every group of folks, they got their own way of doin' things, their own quirks, ya know? You can't just go around sayin' 'all Russians are stubborn' or 'all Japanese are easy goin''. That's just plain dumb. \n\nIt's more like, try to figure out what makes 'em tick, what's important to 'em, and how that's gonna play out when you're sittin' down to talk business.  You're gonna see things through your own lens, sure, but try to look past that and really get a feel for their side.  It's like, learn their history, their hang-ups, the whole shebang. Don't go tryin' to change 'em, just roll with it, especially if you're the one with less to offer at the table.\n\nNow, this ain't just about countries, either.  Every company, they got their own vibe, their own rules. Some are all about workin' late, others are more laid back. You see it in how they dress, how they talk, even who they hire. Some companies give a hoot about charity, others say 'stick to the company plan'. Even here in America, you see it everywhere, from one company to the next, city to city.\n\nValues, those are the real deal. They're the 'why' behind everything. If they're all about savin' face or keepin' things peaceful, you better not go trashin' your boss or your own company just to win a deal.  And if they're all about hagglin' hard, don't expect 'em to fold easy.  \n\nSo, before you even step foot in that negotiatin' room, do your homework, learn the lay of the land. But don't forget, people are people, no matter where they're from. Get to know 'em, build a little rapport, that'll go a long way.",
            "\"A dumb guy once said, 'There ain't no God!'\" Y'know, that's what Psalm 14 says in the Bible, and it's where St. Anselm started his big talk about God.  Thomas Aquinas, another smart dude, seems to think the same thing.  Since both of these guys are trying to prove the same God--the one from the Bible-- let's just go with that, okay?  We gotta keep things simple here.  Now, both of them make some pretty good points, but neither one of them really gives us a super solid reason to believe in God.\n\nLet's start with St. Anselm. He's all about figuring things out through faith, like looking inside yourself to find proof of God. He says that since God's already in our minds, we can't really imagine him NOT being there.  It's kinda confusing when he explains it all fancy-like, but basically, he's saying we don't need to look anywhere else to find God--just look inside ourselves!  He's saying faith is like knowing something deep down even if you can't prove it.\n\nAquinas is way different. He thinks we can prove God exists just by using our brains and looking at the world around us.  No faith needed! This would be awesome for spreading the word about God, right?  People could just be convinced by logic instead of having to believe something without proof.  Aquinas has five big reasons why God must exist: stuff changes, stuff happens because something else made it happen, stuff just exists because something else caused it to exist, there are different levels of good and bad, and everything in the world is kinda organized like a puzzle. He says it all adds up to one thing: God exists!  It's like if you're missing a puzzle piece, you can still know it's there just by looking at the rest of the puzzle.",
            "So, there was this dude, right? Back in the day, like way back, around the 500s BC. He was a prince, but later everyone called him Buddha. This guy, he got all deep and decided to ditch the whole fancy prince thing and figure out life's big mysteries. He ended up becoming super wise, like, totally enlightened. And guess what? His ideas started a whole religion called Buddhism. There's a bunch of different types of Buddhism, but this one's called Theravada, and it's the oldest one, kinda like the OG.\n\nNow, Buddhism is like, super old—almost 2500 years!  Things have changed a lot since Buddha was around, even in places like Sri Lanka, where they still follow Theravada. They have this crazy water-cutting ceremony every year, and even though Buddha never mentioned anything about it, monks and regular folks join in. See, over time, Buddhism has changed a bunch, not just the little stuff like festivals, but even the big ideas.\n\nThere are a couple of important things to remember when we talk about Buddhism changing. First, there are \"internal\" changes, which come from Buddhists themselves, whether they're monks or not. Then there are \"external\" changes, which come from people outside Buddhism. Sometimes these changes are \"hostile,\" meaning they try to hurt Buddhism, and sometimes they're \"benign,\" meaning they don't really care about hurting or helping.\n\nAlright, so let's get down to the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in three big things: the Buddha himself, his teachings (called the Dhamma), and the community of Buddhists (the Sangha). \n\nThe Dhamma is basically a bunch of super old Buddhist texts called the Tripitaka. Think of it like a three-basket collection. One basket has stories and teachings of Buddha (the Suttas), another has rules for monks (the Vinaya), and the last one has deep, kinda philosophical stuff (the Abhidhamma).\n\nThe Abhidhamma talks about things like no-self (Anatta), suffering (Dukkha), and impermanence (Anicca).  These ideas are kinda mind-blowing, but they're like the keys to understanding how to escape the cycle of death and rebirth (Sansara).  \n\nAnd guess what?  To escape Sansara, you gotta get rid of greed (lobha), anger (dosa), and delusion (moha).  You know, the usual stuff. Only when you're enlightened can you finally break free. \n\nThe Vinaya tells everyone, monks and regular folks, how to live a good life. For regular folks, there are five basic rules: no killing, no lying, no stealing, no messing around sexually, and no drinking or doing drugs. Monks have a whole lot more rules to follow. \n\nBut the most important thing in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths.  First, life is suffering (Dukkha). Second, suffering comes from wanting stuff (attachment). Third, you can stop suffering. And fourth, the way to stop suffering is by following the Eightfold Path.",
            "So, get this, the US and Mexico have this crazy history, right? Like, picture this: a super intense rivalry that lasted for, like, 57 years! From 1836 to 1893, these two were always at each other's throats.  \n\nIt all kicked off with the Mexican-American War, where the US basically stomped all over Mexico and snatched up Texas and the Southwest. Talk about a bully! There were tons of other fights, but they finally cooled down right before World War I. \n\nWhy did they hate each other so much? Well, they clashed over religion, culture, and all that jazz. Plus, they wanted the same stuff, which always leads to drama. It's like when you and your sibling fight over the last slice of pizza.\n\nThis rivalry thing isn't unique to them, though. Countries that live next door to each other often have beef, you know? It's like when you have a frenemy who lives next door and keeps borrowing your stuff without asking.\n\nThis guy, David Pletcher, said that the US had major problems with Mexico and Cuba, which makes sense because they're right next door. Meanwhile, other countries in Latin America have been chill with the US.\n\nReligion was a big deal back then. Americans were all about freedom and stuff, while Mexico was super Catholic. It's like when your friend is obsessed with Harry Potter and you're more into Star Wars.\n\nThings got heated because both countries inherited distrust from their past colonial days. It's like when your parents fight and you end up taking sides. \n\nThese two nations had tons of disagreements, mostly about borders. Bandits and outlaws would cross the border and cause trouble, which is not cool.\n\nEventually, Mexico realized it needed the US, and the rivalry died down. The US shifted its focus from taking land to making money, which was a win for Mexico.",

            "Hey there, fellow shell enthusiasts! Ever wonder how those funky spirals on seashells end up looking the way they do? It's a real head-scratcher, right?  Back in the day, some smart guy named D'Arcy Thompson tried to figure it out using math, but it was like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube with your feet!  \n\nNowadays, we're using computer programs to model how shells change shape over time. Think of it like building a virtual seashell, tweaking the knobs and dials to see how it evolves. We're using these models to study a type of snail called Prunum.  We're taking X-rays of their shells to get all the juicy details, then feeding that info into a program called CerioShell. \n\nBasically, we're trying to figure out what the rules are for shell formation, kinda like figuring out the recipe for a perfect seashell cookie!  We're looking at how the whorls (those cool spiral parts) grow and change, how the aperture (the opening) moves, and all that jazz.  And get this, we're even checking out how all these changes happen over millions of years! \n\nIt's like a shell detective story, except instead of clues, we've got math and X-rays.

            "Listen up, cuz I gotta tell ya 'bout this crazy situation in Indonesia.  For the last ten years,  the number of babies and new moms dying hasn't really changed much.  They're doin' alright on stuff like clean water and toilets, but when it comes to keeping the kiddies and moms healthy, they're lagging behind. We gotta figure out why this is happening 'cause just throwin' money at the problem ain't gonna cut it!\n\nNow, they're braggin' 'bout more moms have doctors at their births, but let me tell ya, that ain't the whole story.  They're countin' folks like midwives who ain't really equipped to handle complications.  You know what that means?  Too many moms bleedin' to death 'cause they didn't get the right help.  And get this, fewer kids are even seein' doctors when they got the runs!  And postnatal care?  Forget about it, that's a mess too.\n\nThey ain't doin' enough C-sections either!  Only 4% compared to what they should be doin'.  And guess what?  In the city it's 7%, but out in the sticks it's a measly 2%!  That's right, folks in the city get way better care than the folks in the country.  And it's even worse for the poorest folks. They're strugglin' to get any help 'cause they can't afford it.\n\nSo what's the solution?  Should they just focus on a few programs or fix the whole dang healthcare system?  Programs seem easier, faster, and more focused.  But here's the catch, if you focus on one thing, you forget about everything else.  You end up with a bunch of programs doin' the same thing and nobody knows who's doin' what.  It's a mess!",
            "Okay, so, listen up! Victorian books are all about the fancy stuff and the rich folks, right? But get this, there are these two books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" that are like, totally different. They're still from the Victorian times, but they're all mysterious and kinda spooky, which wasn't really a thing back then. It makes the characters way more interesting, 'cause you get to see their secrets and how they feel about stuff. \n\nTake this part from \"Oliver Twist,\" for example:\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese two books, they use mystery a lot, especially in dreams and stuff. In \"Oliver Twist,\" Oliver's dreams tell us about how he's feeling inside, what hurts him, and what he really thinks about everything going on. \n\nWhen they finally show what happened when Oliver got shot in chapter 28, he relives it like a dream, even though he's trying to get help. It shows how much control Oliver *doesn't* have. He's in so much pain, he doesn't even notice when someone carries him away. It's like his pain is so bad that it's all he can focus on. It makes you wonder who's really in charge here, because it's definitely not Oliver.  He just kinda accepts everything that happens to him.\n\nThe shooting is a big deal because it shows how broken Oliver is. It's like Fagin broke him, made him give up and accept this awful life. \n\n\nIn \"Wuthering Heights,\" they do this dreamy, mysterious thing too, but it's different. \n\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "Okay, so picture this: a couple years back, I was working with these little kids after school, helping them with their homework. I was pretty good at English and reading, so that's what I mostly focused on.  One kid, this little guy named Adrian, he was in like third or fourth grade, was having a real rough time reading. It was super weird, he knew some letters perfectly, but others?  Like, totally clueless.  It didn't make sense! He spoke perfect English, but reading, not so much.  So we were stuck in this loop, struggling, until one day Adrian's mom came to pick him up. She didn't speak a lick of English, just Spanish.   I was just starting to learn Spanish myself, so we managed to piece together a conversation. And then, BAM! It hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet well. I don't know if that helped him much in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now. \n\nI tell this story because it shows how messed up the language barrier can be in schools, especially here in California. It's not always as obvious as we think.  Even if a kid speaks English fluently, reading can still be a total nightmare.  Everyone knows this is a problem, right? So what do we do about it? For Adrian, it was simple: English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and sounds. But for kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated. There's no one magic answer.  Dual language systems, immersion programs, private tutors, ESL classes, none of them are going to fix everything on their own. We need to mix and match! \n\nFirst off, dual language programs are awesome. They're not just for kids who speak Spanish, they're for everyone!  Studies show that kids in these programs do way better in school. There's this whole fear that it's a waste of money and resources, that most kids won't benefit. But that's just not true! If we made these programs the norm instead of the exception, everyone would win. \n\nSo how do we do it? Do we force all teachers to be bilingual?  No way! That's crazy. But what if we had bilingual helpers, tutors, whatever you wanna call them? That makes perfect sense, right?",
            "Alright, check it out.  You ever hear that, like, there's something way bigger than us out there?  Stuff you can't even wrap your head around?  Some folks go to church, some hit up the temple, others just try to figure it out on their own.  Lotsa people just go with what their parents told 'em, y'know?  But some folks, they say, \"Nope, that ain't for me!\" They think their own little world is all that matters.  We change our minds about stuff all the time, right?  What's important today might not be tomorrow.  But we're all tryin' to figure out who we are, what it all means.  We're lookin' for something to guide us through the darkness, somethin' to shine a light on the way.\n\nMy old man, he loved cardinals.  We were sittin' on the porch one day, rain comin' down like crazy.  Tin roof was bangin' like a drum.  We were smokin' cigarettes, him lookin' out at the storm, like he was searchin' for somethin'.  He was skinny, clothes saggin' on him.  Hair was gettin' thin, too.  Didn't look at me much, just stared at the rain.  I felt kinda lost, scared even.  Couldn't bring myself to talk about how much I was gonna miss him, 'cause sayin' it out loud would make it feel real, y'know?  So I just hugged him, moved my chair closer, and looked out at the rain with him.\n\nHe kicked the bucket in December, five days after I turned twenty-two.  Chemo and radiation, they didn't take away his pain, just stretched it out longer than the doctors thought.  What good was that, I don't know.  What kinda God makes that happen?  I didn't pray that night.  If there was a God out there, I figured he wasn't listenin' anymore.\n\nI didn't wanna see him die.  Couldn't bear to watch the life that made me slip away.  I wanted to remember him how he was, not how he ended.  Besides, I knew him better than anyone else, better than his family even.  And I knew he wouldn't want me there, watchin' him fade away.  So I hid in my bed for three days, waitin' for the news.\n\nDidn't get a call.  Not a peep.",
            "Let's talk about those spooky old books we call Gothic Novels. They're kinda like a mixed-up word puzzle, like \"old\" and \"new\" mashed together, you know?  This is what that book-smart guy Ian Watt said, anyway.  People have always gone back and forth about these Gothic stories - some say they're all smoke and mirrors, others say they're super deep and make you feel all tingly inside. \n\nIt all started with a guy named Horace Walpole and his story, \"The Castle of Otranto.\" He mixed up old-timey drama with what was happening in stories *now*.  Think of it like taking a bunch of cool old stuff and putting it in a brand new package. It was like, \"Hey, check out this spooky castle from way back when, but with all the new-fangled stuff we're doing in stories today!\"\n\nBack then, the word \"Gothic\" was kind of a dirty word.  It meant old-fashioned and not as cool as the shiny new stuff. But Walpole got clever and used it to make something totally unique.  He took all those old theatre tricks and fancy castle stuff and threw it into a story where you get inside the characters' heads.\n\nSo, what makes these Gothic stories so cool? Well, one big thing is this idea of \"Chivalry.\"  You know, knights, brave and honorable and all that.  This was a big deal back in the Gothic days, and Walpole wanted to show how awesome it was. He thought maybe the world had forgotten about chivalry and it was time to bring it back!  He had this character, Frederic, who was the perfect knight.  He had all the fancy clothes, the tragic backstory, and the brave heart.  It was like a fairytale come to life, but with a spooky twist.",
            "Alright, listen up, 'cause I'm gonna break down this whole \"supply chain management\" thing for ya. It's basically how we get stuff from the moment someone wants it, all the way back to the raw materials, and then how we make it and send it to them, you know, the whole shebang! This fancy name was cooked up in 1982 by this guy, Keith Oliver. He said it's all about planning, doing it, and making sure everything runs smooth so customers get what they need, fast and efficient, like clockwork! \n\nThere are six key parts to this whole supply chain thing: production, getting the stuff, keeping it in stock, figuring out where everything goes, moving it around, and sharing info. Managers use these six things to make sure customers are happy as clams.\n\nFirst up, you got production. That's the heart of the whole operation. It's all about figuring out when, where, and how to make stuff. Managers gotta know what people want, right?  So they look at the market, see what's hot and what's not. Once they know what customers crave, they decide what to make and how much. Then comes the \"where\" part - which plant is best for making what? Managers gotta think about volume, quality, and making sure customers are stoked. \n\nOnce they got the location figured out, it's time to schedule work and keep the machinery in tip-top shape. Production is super important, every little detail matters. Mess something up, and you could be lookin' at wasted time and money down the road. I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, and lemme tell ya, those places have processes for everything, from how employees dress to how they unload trucks. It's all about keepin' things smooth and runnin' like a well-oiled machine.\n\nNext up is supply. It's all about making smart decisions about what a company can do itself and what to hand off to other companies. Sometimes you got different parts of production for one product, each with its own tools, workers, and specialties. Managers gotta pick the best fit for each part of the process. Outsourcing is another big one - handing off work to other companies to speed things up, keep costs down, and be flexible. Basically, it's about gettin' the job done right while keepin' things cost-effective.",
            "So, picture this: Ellen Page, you know, the chick from Juno? She's on a street corner, holdin' up this cardboard sign with a crazy message scrawled on it. It says, \"Hitler is alive in Burma!\"\n\nNow, Burma, that's also known as Myanmar, right? It's this country in Southeast Asia run by some seriously nasty dudes who took over in 1962. Like, total power grab, coup d'état style. Anyway, back in 2007, these monks decided they'd had enough. They started these protests, the first in ages. They called it the \"Saffron Revolution\" 'cause they wore these orange robes, get it?\n\nAt first, the government was like, \"Whatever, monks, go protest.\" But then things got outta hand. People started joining in, and it turned into a full-blown brawl between the monks and the military.  They were bashin' up monasteries, throwin' people in jail, even killin' journalists just for showin' up.  \n\nThis ain't new, though.  Governments tryin' to squash anyone who disagrees? Been happenin' forever. Like, remember the Roman emperors? They thought they were gods, right? And those Japanese emperors? They're like, literally gods, sent to bring us... Motorola phones and, uh, hara-kiri? And don't even get me started on our own president, George W. Bush.  Seriously, he's buddies with Ted Haggard, the head honcho of Stupid People Worldwide, which sounds like a joke but it's actually a thing.  \n\nThen there was that Tiananmen Square thing in '89.  Students, intellectuals, everyone was out there sayin' \"Enough!\" But the government shut it down real hard.  They say 200-300 people died, but who knows?  And the Rwandan genocide?  Total nightmare. Hutu guys went on a rampage, killin' Tutsis and anyone who dared to stand up to them.  And, of course, there's Hitler's whole \"Final Solution\" thing.  Talk about messed up.",
            "So, get this, Duke Ellington was a total rockstar in jazz.  He played for ages and was always coming up with new stuff for his band.  Sure, he wasn't always the flashiest piano player, but he wrote some seriously awesome tunes that let everyone in the band shine.\n\nHe was like this genius architect, building these musical houses where soloists could go wild and improvise, while still keeping everything tight and groovy.  He knew how to make each player sound their best, and he could make the whole orchestra sound totally unique, like a one-of-a-kind instrument. That's how he came up with some of the coolest jazz ever!\n\nThis one song, \"Creole Love Call,\" is a perfect example.  He used a voice like a real instrument, adding texture and color without any words.  It's like he knew how to make every sound sing, not just the instruments.\n\nAnd get this, he wrote this song with this awesome call-and-response thing going on between the voice and the reeds.  It starts smooth and mellow, then gets all rough and edgy.  Then there's a trumpet solo that's all mellow and bluesy, and a clarinet solo that's super high and fast.  The whole thing builds and builds until it's a total explosion of sound!\n\nHe did the same thing with this song \"Hot and Bothered.\" He had this trumpet player, Bubber Miley, doing this awesome muted trumpet thing, and this singer, Baby Cox, scatting like crazy.  It's like they were trading ideas back and forth, creating this amazing mix of sounds.  And then there's \"It Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing.\" He had this trombone player, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, who played the melody on this muted trombone, and it was just killer!\n\nEllington was a total genius.  He knew how to make every sound count, and he knew how to make music that was both exciting and moving.",
            "She had this gnawing feeling, like something was missing. It started back when she was 14, just starting to figure out this whole being a teenager thing. And three years later, at 17, it was still there. She'd figured out she wanted someone, not some shiny object, but no boys really grabbed her attention. Some tried, going all awkward and lovey-dovey, but nobody clicked. She'd spend days pondering this, trying to figure out why she was so different. Theories popped up, but nothing stuck. So she just kept going, life unfolding with this big question mark hanging over her.\n\nHer days usually went pretty chill. Her folks were cool, calm, never fought. Arguments with her were rare, mostly about her being, well, her - loud, energetic, a total personality explosion.  \n\nBut today wasn't chill. She was bouncing around the house, trying to find some spark for her creative stuff, when a yelp from the kitchen stopped her dead. Her mom's voice, shaky and panicked. \"Mom?! What's wrong?\" she rushed in, heart pounding. There she was, sprawled on the floor, wincing with every breath. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need to go to the hospital,\" her mom gasped.  Her daughter wasted no time. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up!\" Her mom pointed, and the daughter, secretly thankful she'd been toughening herself up at the gym, scooped her mom up and got them to the car.\n\nThe hospital smelled like antiseptic and worry, but all her daughter could focus on was her mom. She practically dragged her inside, yelling for a doctor. Faces swarmed, someone wheeled in a bed, and her mom was whisked away. Her daughter sat there, anxiety buzzing.\n\nTurned out, her mom had been reaching for a vase on the top shelf, slipped off a stool, and BAM!",
            "Alright, so picture this: Researchers wanted to see if following a \"Mediterranean Diet\" – lotsa fruits, veggies, fish, and healthy fats – would keep ya heart healthy and help ya avoid strokes. They had this special score, called the \"alternate Mediterranean\" (aMed) score, to measure how well folks stuck to the diet.  \n\nThey already kinda knew that this diet was good for ya, but they wanted to focus on strokes this time. Think of it like comparing a regular soda to a diet soda. Both are kinda sugary, but the diet one's supposed to be better for you.\n\nSo, they followed over 74,000 nurses for 20 years. Every few years, these nurses filled out questionnaires about what they ate. It's like a super detailed \"What's in your fridge?\" survey. \n\nThese researchers made sure to check if the nurses' answers were accurate by comparing them to other records. They also took into account things like smoking, weight, exercise, and whether or not they took vitamins.\n\nThey found that ladies who scored high on the aMed diet quiz were way less likely to have heart attacks or strokes. It's like they were winning at the heart health game! \n\nSo yeah, this Mediterranean diet thing seems like a pretty good way to keep your ticker in tip-top shape!",
            "Man, lemme tell ya about this crazy time back in 2007. The whole country was screwin' up big time. Jobs vanished faster than a robot bunny after I kick it, and houses were worth less than a chewed-up chew toy. Even the big, fancy companies were crumblin' like stale cookies.  It was a mess, a real doozy!\n\nTurns out, all this started 'cause some folks in charge made some real dumb decisions. They pushed banks and companies to hand out these loans, called sub-prime loans, to folks who probably shouldn't have had 'em. These loans were like a ticking time bomb, see? And with these Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guys, they were packin' these bad loans into these fancy packages and sellin' 'em off like hotcakes.\n\nBut here's the kicker: when folks couldn't pay back those loans, BAM! The whole system went kablooey! Banks were broke, the markets were crashin', and everyone was lookin' around like, \"What just happened?!\"\n\nIt all started way back in 1999, when that Clinton fella was tryin' to stay in power. He wanted everyone happy, so he loosened up the rules on lending.  Little did he know, it was like lettin' a robot bunny loose in a china shop. Disaster, I tell ya!\n\nThen, these fancy new mortgages came along, all complicated and confusing.  Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations... they sounded like somethin' outta a sci-fi movie! But they were makin' folks borrow more and more money, and it was all tied up in the housing market. Like a giant web of debt, and when that web started to unravel...well, let's just say it wasn't pretty.\n\nThe housing bubble burst, and the whole system went belly up. Banks went bankrupt, big companies were sold off cheap, and the government had to step in and clean up the mess. It was a real rollercoaster ride, and it took years for things to start gettin' better.",
            "Alright, let's talk about exposition. It's that part of your story where you get to show off your writing skills, right?  You paint pictures with words, make your readers gasp in awe, maybe even shed a tear or two.  Or, you know, it's the part where your readers start yawning and hitting the \"back\" button faster than a cheetah on speed.  Even Dr. Merlin, the queen of storytelling herself, has been known to yell at her computer screen when she's drowning in a sea of \"tell, don't show.\"\n\nExposition, my friends, is not your best friend. \n\nYou already know the golden rule: \"Show, don't tell.\" But sometimes, even the best writers slip up and end up writing pages and pages of nothing happening, or worse, too much happening.  It's like that little voice in your head whispering, \"Just get all the boring stuff out of the way so we can get to the good part!\" But that voice is a sneaky little devil, always tempting you to overload your readers with unnecessary details about every character's childhood and every insignificant event.\n\nThink about it: exposition is like that scene in a movie where one character simply dumps a ton of information on another, like a cheesy version of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In writing, it's the author doing the telling instead of showing.\n\nHere's a simple example.  Let's say you're reading a story and suddenly you're told that the heroine met her beloved at a certain time and place, got married in a big fancy ceremony, and then, BAM! He's murdered right in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire life-changing saga to take up two pages, with both characters only getting two lines of dialogue each. You'd want to feel the love between them, see it in their actions and words, understand why the heroine is so devastated.\n\nA good introduction to the husband's character would allow you to connect with him emotionally, mourn his death with her, and understand the depth of their love. You'd feel invested in her pain.\n\nIn short, you'd want the author to give you more than just the bare bones of the story: \"They met, they married, he died.\"  You want the juicy details, the emotional depth, the \"meat on the bone,\" so to speak.\n\n\nSometimes, it's tempting to rush past details about your characters, like that night manager at the gas station who used to be in the Air Force, got married twice, no kids, loves fishing, secretly wants to own the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nGive your readers a glimpse into his soul!",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this crazy stuff I saw on the news today. These Columbus dudes, they were talkin' about this dude named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. Now, they showed his mugshot and man, that guy looked like he'd just crawled outta a horror movie. They didn't waste too much time on it, just a couple minutes, 'cause it was still a mess. They said he stabbed her a bunch of times and got arrested, but that was about it.\n\nThen they talked about this shootin' in Sharon Woods. Some 18-year-old named Travis Buyers got shot real bad. No arrests yet, SWAT team was all over it. Seemed like they skimmed over this one quick, though. Kinda makes you think, ya know? Like, if it was a white kid, they'd be all over it 24/7. But when it's a black kid, they barely mention it. Happens all the time, man. Makes me mad.\n\nNext up, they found a bullet hole in a Med-Flight chopper! Crazy, right? Turns out it was a .22 caliber, fired from a rifle. They're offering five grand for any info about the shooter.\n\nThen they teased us with some rain and thunderstorms comin' Saturday, said it'd be hot as heck all weekend. \n\nOh, and they talked about this robbery at a UDF. Some dude with a hoodie, dark-skinned black guy, they kept screamin'. Six-foot tall, 150 pounds. Kinda weird how much they focused on his skin color, don't ya think?\n\nFinally, they had this story about Rene Rodriguez, some big-time drug dealer from Texas. Got busted for slingin' weed to Ohio. They said he got 300 months, which is 25 years, but who knows why they said it like that. Kinda seemed like they wanted to make it sound scarier. And they mentioned he was Hispanic, but what's that got to do with anything?",
            "Man, being a brother is wild, ya know? It's like this super strong connection, like, you get each other in a way nobody else can. It's got all sorts of feelings mixed up in it, like love, pride, even jealousy and anger sometimes. You see yourself in your brother, more than anyone else. It's like lookin' in a mirror, except it's a mirror that shows ya the real you, the good and the bad. And when things get tough, that bond really shines, whether it's for good or for bad.\n\nBut here's the thing, all those feelings come with a price, you know? Like, you gotta deal with the mess they make. When you look your brother dead in the eye and see yourself back at ya, it's like you see yourself clear as day, not how people think you are, but how you really are. It's in your actions and what happens because of them that you see your true colors.\n\nThat's what this story, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" is all about. Two brothers, they're out there in this beautiful place, but they're on this crazy journey that's doomed from the start. It's all about pride and disappointment clashing, and in the end, only one brother walks away. You see it all through the main guy, Doodle, and how he sees his brother. He sees the world through his own messed up feelings, and that shapes everything he does.\n\nThe main guy, he's all about pride, from the start. He wanted a brother who was tough, who could keep up with him, who could do all the cool stuff he dreamed of. But Doodle, well, he was born different. He was weak, and it was clear he wasn't gonna be the brother the main guy had in mind.  It made the main guy angry, even made him think about doing something awful. But then Doodle smiles, and the main guy's heart softens. He loves his brother, even if he doesn't always show it.",
            "Yo, check it! So, our brains are like, totally wild, right? They're constantly buzzin' with info, like a super-charged computer. Back in the day, folks thought our brains were like wax tablets or papyrus scrolls, you know, the old-school stuff. Then, they started comparing them to books, and now, it's all about computers. But here's the deal:  these comparisons are cool, but they can also be misleading, so don't take 'em too seriously.\n\nImagine your senses, like your eyes, ears, and skin, as input devices, taking in all the crazy stuff around you. They turn all those sights, sounds, smells, and feels into signals your brain can understand. Then, your brain, it's like a mad scientist, throwing these signals around, analyzing them from every angle. It's like a mix of bottom-up and top-down processing, where your brain builds up a picture from the basic details and also uses what it already knows to make sense of things faster. Like, say you see a black box on a white background. Your brain zooms in on the details: the color, the shape, the edges. It's all bottom-up. But, 'cause your brain's a genius, it also uses what it already knows about boxes to figure out it's a box, not some weird white hole. That's top-down processing in action.\n\nNow, your brain's got this super important filter called attention. It decides what's important and what can chill. It's like a bouncer at a club, letting in the VIPs and keeping out the riff-raff. So, while your brain's processing every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, your attention filter's like, \"Nah, we don't need to know that level of detail.\" But, if someone yells your name in a crowded room, bam, your attention's all over it.\n\nAnd get this, your brain's got different memory banks: sensory, working, and long-term. Sensory memory's like a super-fast snapshot, holding info for a split second. Working memory's like your mental scratchpad, holding onto info for a bit longer, about 20 seconds or so. Long-term memory's the big kahuna, storing all your memories for years, maybe even a lifetime.\n\nSo, how's all this knowledge organized in your brain? That's a question scientists are still trying to figure out. Some think it's like a network, with different concepts connected like nodes. Imagine, \"chair\" linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Okay, so picture this: Aldous Huxley is freaking out about technology and how money runs everything. He wrote this book \"Brave New World\" to show us what happens when we get too obsessed with happiness and being part of the crowd. In this world, people are basically robots who just want to have fun and don't care about anything else.\n\nThey're controlled by this big boss guy called the World Controller, who makes sure everyone stays happy and doesn't think too much about the system. It's like a giant game, and the people are just pawns.\n\nThink about Marxism, man. Huxley is totally throwing shade at capitalism in this book. He's talking about how people are brainwashed into thinking that buying stuff and being part of the group is all that matters. They don't even realize they're being controlled! \n\nThe book is like a big warning about how capitalism can make people lose their freedom and individuality. It's like they're all trapped in a big, happy bubble, but it's all fake.  They're just following the rules and buying stuff, and they don't even know it.\n\nAnd get this, there's no real love or emotion in this world. People just hook up for fun and don't care about each other. It's all superficial and fake. The characters are so shallow, it's like Huxley is saying that capitalism is sucking the soul out of humanity.\n\nSo yeah, Huxley is basically saying that if we keep going down this path of technology and consumerism, we're all gonna become robots who are controlled by the system.",

Been here for a hot minute, like two and a half years, which is, like, four and a half semesters. \n\nGetting around this place can be a real pain in the neck, lemme tell ya. My freshman year, they stuck me in these dorms called East Halls, which were way out on the edge of campus, like, past the stadium and that big Bryce Jordan Center thing.  \n\nMan, going from my digs in Stuart Hall to classes way over by Willard, which is kinda in the middle of all this, could take, like, 25 minutes on foot. And forget about it if the weather was acting up, 'cause State College weather is, like, the worst.\n\nI was shootin' the breeze with this guy who graduated not that long ago, and he told me that back in the day, East Halls was like miles away from everything else.  There was just, like, this huge empty space between them and the rest of the school. Now, that space is filled with sports fields, new buildings like that fancy Creamery and that new health place, and apartments everywhere. It's like they just keep building and building, and it's getting harder and harder to get from one spot to another.\n\nSo, what's the answer? Well, I'll tell ya, it's gotta be bikes. Bikes are the way to go. But, ya know, it's not just about having bikes. The campus itself needs to be built with bikes in mind.\n\nLast week I was talkin' to this dude who got back into bikin' after, like, years. He told me he didn't know why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are the best,\" he said. \"For a while, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\"\n\nBesides bein' good for ya, bikes are the quickest way to travel. A little oatmeal and a little pedalin' can take ya 30 miles or more.  \n\nI'm livin' off campus now, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest thing I did this year was buy a bike. Every day, I gotta go to Thomas building for class, which is, like, a 25-minute walk from my place. But on my bike, I can get there in 5 minutes if I really pump those pedals.\n\nThe only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas, but it ain't always the easiest ride.  \n\nWalkin' ain't bad, but I'm just too busy to walk everywhere. If I didn't have my bike, I'd be walkin' all the time. Walkin' to Thomas every day would steal, like, 30-40 minutes outta my day. That's like, two and a half hours every week. Plus, all the other walkin' I'd have to do for other classes, appointments, and stuff.  Where'd I find the time for that?"
