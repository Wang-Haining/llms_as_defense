            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "SA2B here!  So, I'm thinkin' about becoming a social worker, y'know, helpin' out the little guys who got it rough. Kids who've been through the wringer, families messin' up, that kinda thing.  I figure, I can offer a few things to the social work game. First off, I'm all about helpin' people, always have been. Secondly, I treat everyone with respect, no matter what. And, I'm a straight-shooter, always doin' the right thing. I wanna make things better for folks, not just in their lives, but for myself too. Gotta keep learnin' and growin' to be the best I can be.\n\nSee, I always wanted to do somethin' to make a difference, but wasn't sure how.  Went through high school and college, saw a lot of folks runnin' from their problems, makin' bad choices.  That's why I got my psychology degree, figured it would give me some tools to help.\n\nThen one day, this friend of mine had this kid, just sixteen, all nervous, stayin' on her couch. Turns out, he was runnin' from some messed-up parents. Next day, heard he'd called the cops. Figured I'd lend a hand, so I went over to his folks' place. Talked to the cops, told 'em about my degree and my concerns. They wanted me to talk to the parents, said there wasn't much they could do.\n\nWell, when I talked to the parents, they were all jumpy, makin' excuses for how their son was just \"manipulative\" for gettin' the cops involved. It was a \"simple\" family fight, they said.  That's when it hit me, that's what I wanna do, help these kids who are stuck in these messed-up situations. \n\nSocial work ain't just about helpin' kids, though. It's about standin' up for what's right, fightin' for those who can't fight for themselves. You know, like when folks say everyone's an individual, but then they wanna make everyone fit in the same mold? That ain't right. I'm unique, and I wanna see everyone else be unique too.\n\nBack in high school and college, I did my part. Dyed my hair crazy colors, wore what I wanted, pierced my ears, joined the GSBA, spoke up against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it.  That's what social justice is all about, standin' up for what's right, even when it's hard. And I'm gonna keep doin' it.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this thing called insomnia, see? Some folks think it's all in your genes or your body, kinda like a bug in the system. They call that the \"biological\" model. Others say it's more about where you're from, who your folks are, and the whole shebang of life's craziness. That's the \"sociocultural\" model.\n\nSo, to figure this thing out, we gotta look at both sides. Like, some folks have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep (that's insomnia, plain and simple). Others sleep way too much, or fall asleep at random times (that's the hypersomnia crew). Then there's folks who have crazy dreams, sleepwalk, or even talk in their sleep. It's a real mixed bag!\n\nNow, the \"biological\" folks say it's all about these tiny things in your brain called neurons. They fire and they don't fire, and that's what makes you sleep or wake up.  This one study used mice, see, and they found these special neurons that control sleep. When these neurons get messed up, bam! You've got trouble sleeping. \n\nThe \"sociocultural\" folks say it's more about your environment. Where you live, who you hang out with, even your job can affect your sleep.

            "Hey there! So, let's talk about this thing called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short.  It's kinda like, your brain has trouble understanding what your ears are hearing, even if you can hear just fine. Imagine trying to sort out a bunch of noisy voices in a crowded room – that's what it's like for folks with CAPD. \n\nThis wasn't always called CAPD, though. Back in the 50s, they called it \"auditory imperception.\"  A bunch of smart folks started figuring out how it works, like these researchers in Italy and a guy named Kimura. They came up with tests to see if a kid's brain was processing sounds the way it should.  \n\nCAPD can show up in all sorts of ways.  Maybe someone has trouble hearing sounds from different directions, or they can't tell the difference between similar sounds, like \"cat\" and \"hat.\" They might also have a hard time understanding speech when there's a lot of background noise, or they might not pick up on changes in tone, like when someone's being sarcastic.  It's like their brain is missing some of the clues!\n\nSo, how do you know if someone has CAPD? Well, there are these special tests that audiologists and speech therapists give. They might ask you to listen to different sounds and tell them what you hear, or they might watch how you respond to different kinds of auditory information.  There's no one magic test, though, and we don't know exactly what causes CAPD.",

            "Alright, so lemme tell ya about this German place they called a \"colony,\" right?  It was a real mess, especially in this place called South West Africa, now Namibia.  They were real meanies to the locals, like the Ovaherero and Nama folks,  kinda like a really bad bully. But hey, not all Germans were bad, ya know? Some were actually kinda cool.  Like in East Africa, they built schools and stuff for the local folks.  But in South West Africa, it was like, \"nah, we ain't doin' that.\" They left it all up to these church groups, and they didn't give 'em much dough.  They did spend a ton of money on schools for the white folks though. Weird, right?  \n\nAnyway, this messed up the whole place, even after the Germans were gone.  East Africa had lots of smart folks, but in South West Africa, most people couldn't read or write.   There are these books about this stuff, written way back when, mostly in German.  They just kinda describe what was goin' on.  Later, some folks wrote more books in English, comparing all the different colonies. They figured out that South West Africa was different 'cause there were a lot more white folks livin' there.   One guy, Cohen, wrote a whole thing about this, sayin' it all comes down to how many white folks were there.   It was mostly hot and dry, but still, a bunch of white folks settled there. By 1913, there were almost 15,000 of them, way more than in any other colony.",
            "Man, music's gotten wild over the last hundred years, right? Like, there are so many different types now it's hard to keep track. You got your rap, your rock, your country, your jazz, your folk...  Heck, even those have tons of little branches and branches of branches!  But seriously, heavy metal rocks, dude! It's been around for about forty years and it's gone from just one sound to, like, a whole universe of sounds. It's all about feeling something deep, you know? It's like the music gets right in your soul, even if it's the dark side of your soul.\n\nAnd the crazy part? People have been messing with metal since day one,  always trying to make it weirder and wilder. It's like a chain reaction, man!  One band does something new, and then a bunch of other bands are like, \"Whoa, that's cool, let's take it even further!\" And that's how we got all these crazy sub-genres, and sub-sub-genres, and who knows what else.  \n\nNow, it's so hard to say what metal *is* anymore. It's like a melting pot of everything. But it all started somewhere, right? To get the whole picture, we gotta look back at what metal is really about.\n\nIt's more than just a bunch of loud music. It's a whole movement, a whole attitude. It's like a scream into the darkness. You got the heavy bass, the crushing volume, the wild energy, the crazy shows... It's like metal bands are saying, \"We're not messing around, we're here to make you FEEL something!\" And they're not afraid to get intense, man. They really know their instruments, and they're not afraid to show off.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the drugs, dude. Back in the 70s, everyone was tripping out on all sorts of stuff, and it totally influenced the music.  Metal became a way to express that wild, chaotic energy.  It was like, \"Hey, we're not afraid of the dark side, we embrace it!\"\n\nAnd you know what? It's still going strong today. Metal bands are still pushing boundaries, still exploring the darkest corners of the human experience. It's a pretty amazing thing, when you think about it.",
            "Okay, so check this out. This dude, Henri Rousseau, painted like crazy back in the day, way before all those other weirdos were painting their weird dreams.  He's like, a Post-Impressionist, you know, one of those guys who did his own thing.  He had this painting, *The Dream*,  it's from 1910, and it's about this girl totally blown away by this crazy dreamland. But get this, it's also about Rousseau's own dreams, like, what he wanted to be and all that jazz. \n\nSee, this dude dreamed of being a big shot artist, like, everyone loving his stuff and all that. But here's the catch:  he had this major inner struggle.  Should he paint like everyone else to get famous, or should he just do his own thing and be unique? *The Dream* is like his whole life story, y'know?\n\nRousseau, this guy, he was born way back in 1844, in France. His dad was a business kinda guy, and Rousseau, he didn't go to art school or nothin'. He was working for the government, like collecting tolls or somethin'. He even had this nickname, \"douanier,\" which is like a customs inspector.  Life wasn't easy for him. He lost his first wife and a bunch of kids.  So, he decided to paint, to make himself feel better, I guess. \n\nHe really wanted to be accepted by the art world, which is understandable, right?  He wasn't a fancy art school guy, he started painting later in life, and there were tons of other crazy talented artists around.  He even started getting noticed around the same time as Matisse, who was already a superstar. This guy Gordon wrote a book about French painters, and he says that Matisse was all about avoiding boring art, while Rousseau just wanted to paint something so \"normal\" that people would finally like him.",
            "So, get this, right? A bunch of brainy folks have been saying that ethics and art, truth and beauty, are like, totally connected. And you know what? I kinda agree. Like, Keats, that poet dude, he said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"  We learn stuff through school and stuff, but  ethics and art, they just kinda...click with us, ya know? It's not like we're taught to appreciate a good painting or a good deed, it just happens. \n\nThink about it. We try to explain why something's art or why something's right, but can we really?  Like, we can talk about the Mona Lisa's colors and stuff, but that doesn't explain why it's so darn cool.  It's like when someone asks about your favorite book or song, you just kinda go, \"There's just something about it...\"  Art and morals, they're more than just rules or explanations, ya know? They're kinda like...transcendent, like there's this extra something special they got.  \n\nFlannery O'Connor, she said stories are like, the only way to say some things, 'cause words just can't do it justice. Same with art and morals, there's this thing they got that goes beyond what you can put into words.\n\nSee, it's like we feel art and morals deep down, in this way that's hard to explain.  It's like, beyond our normal thinking, ya know? And literature, man, it's extra special 'cause it deals with values, with what's important in life. It's like life itself, full of stuff we gotta figure out.\n\nSo, yeah, I think art and morals are super connected 'cause they both hit us in this deep, meaningful way that words can't always capture.",
            "Hey, check this out! Germany today is a total powerhouse, a country with its own awesome vibe, from the mountains near Munich to the Baltic Sea in Kiel. It's like one big party, all the way from Cologne on the Rhine River to Dresden by the Elbe. With a culture so unique, it makes sense that Germany, as we know it, came from all sorts of different groups and tribes. \n\nThe place where it all started is called Germania, the homeland of the Germans. Where the name came from, though, is a mystery! Some say it's from a tribe called the Tungrians, who were like, \"Yo, we're the Germans now!\" before they crossed the Rhine and messed with the Gauls (according to Tacitus, a guy who wrote stuff a long time ago).  Julius Caesar, the guy who fought the Gauls and wrote about it, was the first to use the word \"Germanus\" to talk about these tough guys. He used it to tell the difference between the Gauls he beat and the Germans he hadn't conquered yet. Some think it came from a word the Gauls used for \"neighbor,\" but who knows for sure? Caesar said in his book about the Gallic Wars that the Germans were always fighting the Gauls, like it was their daily routine (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others think it comes from the spear the Germans used, called a \"ger,\" or maybe from an old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" because Germans are loud, you know?\n\nThis Roman dude named Tacitus, who wrote stuff way back in AD 98, said the Germans were pure and hadn't mixed with other people, like they just appeared out of nowhere. He's like, \"Why would anyone leave Asia or Africa for a place like Germany? It's wild, the weather is bad, and the people are grumpy!\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nThe Romans didn't really want to live in Germania, but they did send folks there to get stuff and fight sometimes. They mostly stayed in their own big empire. Meanwhile, the Germans hung out on the edge of Rome's territory, trading their stuff and even joining the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "So there I was, staring down at this thing, my brain just kind of...spinning. I wasn't really *feeling* anything, just kinda watching it like a scientist, you know?  Thoughts were popping up and disappearing faster than I could catch them. It was like my brain was on autopilot, just soaking up the sight in front of me.\n\nRemember that art book I got, the one about drawing with your \"right brain\"?  \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" or something like that.  It taught you how to actually *see* things, like breaking down a whole scene, a kitchen with a fruit bowl and everything, into just that bowl of fruit.  That's what I was trying to do here, but my brain was overloaded.\n\nI mean, Picasso had his blue period, Monet loved painting his gardens, and all those Renaissance guys were all about the colors. I was thinking, maybe this is my thing, my \"Work in Brown.\"  My masterpiece.\n\nI grabbed my weapon of choice - a mop - and got ready to create. My hand was steady, my mind focused. I could almost feel the artistic energy flowing through me.  The water swirled, so smooth and clear...then I whacked the toilet handle, and that's when it hit me.  This wasn't a masterpiece, it was a pile of brown mush someone left as a message for the poor schmuck who had to clean it. \n\nI flushed again, took a deep breath, and tried to focus.  I wrapped the toilet paper around my hand like a glove, ready to face the brown beast.  Why did people do this to others? It was like they were saying, \"Hey, enjoy your day! Here's a little gift!\"  A gift of poop.",
            "Yo, check it! Teenagers are gettin' themselves killed behind the wheel, man. It's a real bummer.  \n\nSee, the thing is, their brains ain't fully cooked yet for all the craziness of driving. And, let's face it, they're newbies at this whole driving thing.  They crash more, spin out, speed like maniacs, and even go off the road more often.\n\nAnd guess what? They're more likely to crash when they're cruisin' with their buddies – which, you know, is like, totally normal for teens. Some smart folks in California did a study and found the younger the passenger, the more likely they were to get into a fender bender.\n\nSo, states like California have tried to make things safer by giving teenagers these temporary licenses that limit their driving hours and who they can have in the car.  \n\nBut, let's be real, those temporary licenses are just a bandaid on a bullet hole. The real problem is that young drivers, as a group, just aren't ready for the responsibility, man. One psychologist dude, Marvin Zuckerman, even thinks 18 is too young to get a full license. He says young people, especially those under 20, just crave that adrenaline rush, you know? They love to push the limits.\n\nSo, maybe we should wait until that thrill-seeking fades a bit before handing them the keys. If we keep giving licenses to young teens, we're gonna see even more accidents, and the death toll is gonna be outta control.  \n\nThink about it – in a few years, all those baby boomers' kids are gonna be old enough to drive, and it's gonna be a whole mess.\n\nWe need to get serious about this. Schools can still teach them about driving, but no one under 18 should be behind the wheel.  We can still have those temporary licenses and make them log some practice hours with a grown-up.\n\nWe need to make this a national thing, man. It's not like anyone's coming up with a new idea here. Just gotta make it happen.",
            "So, I was  checking out some old Edison flicks at the Library of Congress, you know, the ones from way back in the day, like the 1890s and early 1900s.  There were a bunch of these  \"trick films\" -  they were all about pullin' the wool over your eyes with crazy editing. I spent a good while figuring out how they did their magic, how they made things appear and disappear, and what made some of those later films stand out from the crowd. \n\nMost of these early trick films were like little stages, all set up in front of a camera.  They never moved the camera around, just kept it fixed like you'd see in a play.  They stuck to long shots and the occasional medium shot, never getting up close and personal like we do today.  And get this - each trick was usually just one long shot, kinda like a continuous performance.\n\nThey really leaned into that stage vibe, just like vaudeville or magic shows.  The actors would walk side-to-side, never coming forward or backward towards the camera. It was like they were stuck in a box, ya know?  Take \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" for example, everyone just shuffled back and forth.\n\nAnd because they didn't move close to the camera, they never used close-ups.  It was all about seeing the whole picture at once, just like in a live performance.\n\nBecause each trick was basically one long shot, the whole film was usually super short, maybe a minute or less.  Most of them were just a quick series of tricks, like magic, disappearing acts, or switching stuff around. It wasn't really about telling a story, more like a bunch of mini-acts strung together.  Oh, but here's the sneaky part - what looks like one shot to you might actually be a bunch of shots glued together to make the illusion work. Check out \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" - it looks like one long shot, but if you look closer, you'll see where they secretly switched out Mary's head!",
            "Alright, listen up! This guy John Taylor, real stickler for freedom, especially when it came to farming.  He was all about folks doing their own thing, no government meddling.  He thought farming was the best gig ever, and that's what shaped his whole take on how things should run.  He wanted a government that said \"Hey, you do your thing, we'll do ours, and let's keep it that way.\"\n\nHe thought America had a clean slate, no old traditions getting in the way. That meant they could build a government that worked for everyone, based on the idea that everyone's got basic rights that no one can mess with.  He was big on those \"natural rights\" – like, if one gets squashed, they all get squashed, ya know?  No way the government should be messing with those.  \n\nJohn thought the government should be like this cautious guardian, keeping the good stuff from getting messed up and stopping the bad stuff from going too far.  He believed folks are good at heart, but also kinda sneaky, always looking out for number one.  That's why he wanted a government that protected your stuff, helped farmers out, and kept things fair.\n\nHe was all about sticking to the Constitution, too. No fancy interpretations, just plain words.  He thought the government should be small and leave folks alone, but not so small that it couldn't keep things in line. He even thought the Declaration of Independence was more important 'cause it showed the states were in charge, not some big ol' national government.",
            "Okay, so check it out. We had this whole tracker for people who were ditching their cars and trying out other ways to get around campus, right? Well, things were totally rad at first, but then BAM!  Around month three, the number of folks logging their trips dropped like a rock. Kinda bummed us out, to be honest.\n\nSee, winter hit our college town, and everyone's less likely to bike or walk when it's freezing. Plus, December is crazy busy with schoolwork and holiday stuff. Who can be bothered with logging their commute when they're stressed out? And then, boom, holidays hit, and everyone's gone!\n\nEven after things calmed down in January, the log submissions didn't really pick up.  I guess sometimes projects just lose steam after the initial hype.  \n\nSo, we decided to throw a \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March.  We gave out prizes like gift certificates to local shops and restaurants – you know, the usual stuff. It kinda worked, but it was kinda like trying to keep a goldfish swimming upstream.  We learned that keeping people engaged is a real challenge, especially with holidays and school breaks messing with the flow.\n\nAnother thing we learned is that people love their cars! It's like a cultural thing. So, we gotta come up with some seriously awesome incentives to get folks ditching their rides. You know, like a sweet new bike, a hybrid car, or even a killer electric car! Maybe that would have kept things exciting. \n\nHonestly, the prizes we had were cool at first, but maybe we should have upped the ante as the project went on. Imagine if we had announced a couple of bikes in December, then a whole hybrid car in January… I bet people would have been all over it!",
            "Yo, lemme break down this ETF thing for ya.  It's like a basket of investments, kinda like a mutual fund, but you can buy and sell it on the stock market like a regular stock.  You get the good stuff from both worlds:  diversification like a fund, but you can play the game like a stockbroker, ya know?   Short selling, margin buying, all that jazz. Plus, ETFs usually cost way less than mutual funds.   \n\nBut hold up, there's a catch. You gotta pay a fee every time you buy or sell, just like with stocks. And don't get me wrong, there are tons of different ETFs out there, so you gotta do your homework and figure out which one's right for you.  \n\nNow, let's talk about this IHF ETF. I'm gonna look at its top ten holdings, which make up a big chunk of the whole thing.  My buddy Gage's dad got a hold of this thing called \"HULK\" on DVD, but I already saw it in the theater.  Anyway, I wanna see if owning just these top ten stocks is better than owning the whole ETF.\n\nLet's see if these stocks really hold up their end of the bargain.  I'm gonna compare their returns and risk (that's the \"Beta\" stuff) to the whole ETF.  \n\nTurns out, owning just those top ten stocks could give you a bigger return and less risk!  But hey, maybe I'm wrong.  We gotta do some fancy math to make sure those differences are real, ya know?\n\nSo, I'm gonna check the \"standard deviation\" of each of those stocks to see how they shake out compared to the whole ETF.  That'll tell me if owning those ten stocks is really a better deal than the whole shebang.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya about this poem, \"Dream-Land,\" by Edgar Allan Poe. It's one of his favorites, ya know? He uses this word \"Thulé,\" twice in the poem, and it's a big deal. This word goes way back to Virgil, an old-school dude who wrote about an island way up north, where everyone thought the world ended. Virgil used it, for sure, but Poe was a big fan of German writers, especially this guy Goethe. Now, this Goethe dude wrote this epic poem called \"Faust,\" and it's super famous.  One part of \"Faust\" has a poem called \"The King of Thulé,\" and it's about this king who loses his wife and goes totally bonkers, drinking himself to death.\n\nSome folks say Poe was basically copying Goethe's style, especially since they both talk about this gloomy place called Thulé.  Poe even uses it twice in his \"Dream-Land,\" like bookends, ya know?  \n\nPoe's \"Dream-Land\" is all about this dark, lonely place, with dead friends haunting him, and everything's gray and lifeless. Kinda like the king in Goethe's poem, he's lost his wife and his will to live. It's like Poe stepped right into Goethe's poem. \n\nPoe loved German stuff, and he was a big fan of Tennyson, who was also into Goethe. So, Poe probably knew about Goethe's work even if he didn't directly copy him.",
            "So, picture this: there's this chick, Jennifer, right? She goes to D&D grocery store, steps on some applesauce, BAM! Takes a spill and hurts her back real bad. Now, she's sayin' the store manager, Martin, shoulda known better 'cause folks had been slipping on spills before. See, two employees told him about the applesauce mess, but he was busy eatin' dinner and said \"Nah, not my problem.\" Half an hour later, BAM! Jennifer goes down.\n\nNow, Jennifer's lawyer's sayin' Martin acted real shady. They're talkin' 'bout \"punitive damages,\" which means extra money to punish the store for bein' jerks. \n\nThey're sayin' Martin knew folks were slipping and didn't care.  They say he acted like a total jerk, like he wanted Jennifer to get hurt. \n\nThe judge ain't gonna throw this case out just yet, 'cause Jennifer's got some points. She can say that Martin knew spills were a problem, and he didn't do nothin' about it. Even though it might not be as clear-cut as \"Martin wanted Jennifer to fall,\"  it's still a decent argument. \n\nIt all started back in October of 2009. Rich Wayne, a D&D employee, told Martin about the applesauce spill. Martin was all, \"Dude, I'm busy eatin', deal with it yourself.\"  Then, Mary J. Haddigan, another worker, tells him again, and Martin gives the same lazy answer.  Well, half an hour later, Jennifer slips and breaks her back.  And get this,  five people already fell and got hurt that year because of spills!  \n\nSo, now Jennifer's takin' D&D to court, wantin' money for her pain and suffering, plus some extra dough to punish them for bein' reckless.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this Islam class I took like, four years back at CBC. We were always going back and forth about whether Islam was, like, a bad religion or not.  It's even more messed up now than back then, ya know? Since 9/11, the media went from all \"Islam is bad!\" to \"Islam is awesome!\" like, overnight. I mean, back in 2001, could ya even imagine a prez running with a name like Barack Obama, who's got a Muslim family history? \n\nThis Muhammad dude's story really got me thinking. See, I thought he was all about forcing people to convert, conquering tribes and making 'em Muslim. But this book paints him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble.  It's like he's the good guy who just, ya know, spread the truth, and people came to him on their own. \n\nThere's even some stuff that's kinda like Jesus' story, like when Muhammad, like, multiplied some mutton and milk for forty guys. It's all super shady, ya know? Like they're trying to make Muhammad look like some kind of miracle worker, to, like, steal Jesus' thunder.\n\nAnd get this, they got all these stories about how people converted, but they're all secondhand.  It's like, \"So-and-so heard from so-and-so who heard from...\" It's all fishy, man.\n\nThe worst part is, they're trying to make Muhammad out to be this perfect, humble, wise dude. But history says different. Muhammad was a warrior, man!  I just wonder if Muslims today know the real deal about this guy.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin' 'bout Christianity.  It's like this, Jesus had his own way of doin' things, ya know?  But then, after he was gone, things started to change. Kinda like when you leave a pizza out too long - it gets all weird and different. Christianity went on its own wild ride, gettin' further and further from Jesus' original message.\n\nNow, these days, everyone's all about change, right?  They wanna try new things and break the rules.  But there are still some folks stuck in the old ways, clingin' to what they know. They ain't gonna let go easy.\n\nBut here's the thing: more and more people are gonna start lookin' back, seein' all the stuff that got added to Christianity over the years. They're gonna wanna know what Jesus really meant, what he truly taught.  It might take a while, maybe decades, maybe even centuries, but it's gonna happen.\n\nThink of it like rewindin' a tape.  Christianity's gonna go back to its roots, strip away all the extra stuff, until it's just Jesus' pure teachings. People are gonna be like, \"Hey, remember when things were simpler?\"  And they'll start worshipin' like they did back in Jesus' time, just followin' his lead.\n\nThe church will still be around, leadin' the way, but everything's gonna be different.  All the different groups and denominations, they'll start to look more and more alike. It's like when the Roman Empire went from crushin' Christians to bein' ruled by 'em.\n\nHistory's full of these big shifts, y'know? It's like a rollercoaster, goin' up and down, changin' direction. And this next big shift's gonna be all about Christianity, goin' back to its original form, gettin' rid of all the extra stuff, and bringin' everyone together. \n\nAnd get this, a big part of it's gonna be seein' Jesus' words in a new way, like metaphors, not just plain ol' instructions.  It's like, he was tryin' to tell us somethin' deeper, somethin' we gotta figure out on our own.\n\nSo what happened after Jesus? Well, way back when, there was just Judaism. That was the start of it all, ya know? One God, the Bible, that's what it was all about.  The Jews, they weren't all on the same page, though. They had their different groups, like the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, and so on.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin' about this book, *The Jungle*. It's a real eye-opener, man. It shows how humans, deep down, are kinda selfish, ya know? They're all about lookin' out for number one and makin' their lives better, but they don't care about anyone else, especially if that someone's lower on the food chain.\n\nYou see it everywhere in the book, especially with those factory owners and bosses. All they care about is makin' their companies bigger and richer, no matter what. They don't give a hoot about the people workin' for them or the damage they're doin' to the environment.\n\nSinclair, the guy who wrote it, paints a pretty grim picture. He describes these factories like giant, smokin' monsters, spewin' out pollution and stink.  He's sayin' these guys don't care about the people, the animals, nothin'!\n\nAnd those bosses? Forget about it! They treat their workers like dirt.  They make 'em work long hours, then just fire 'em without a second thought. No help, no nothin'. It's like they're slaves, trapped in this system with no way out.  \n\nThere weren't many rules back then to protect people, so these guys could get away with anything.  They pushed their workers to the limit, made 'em work in awful conditions. It's messed up, man. They expected people to just take it, to die in those factories or whatever.\n\nEven the unions weren't much help. They were more about makin' money off the workers than actually standin' up for 'em.\n\nIt's a tough story, but it shows a dark side of humanity. It makes you think about how we treat each other, how we let greed and power corrupt us.",
            "Okay, so like, some writers, ya know, they use super cool tricks to make you feel a certain way about stuff. It's like, they're trying to plant a vibe. Fitzgerald, the dude who wrote *The Great Gatsby*, he's a master at this. He's like, 'Hey, let's pair up some random words, just to see what kinda crazy feeling it makes'. He also loves using symbols, like colors, to sneak in these extra meanings.  \n\nTake colors, for example: gold, green, white, gray, even red and pink. Fitzgerald, he's got a whole system going on with these colors, and he uses them to give you a sneak peek into what's really important in the story.\n\nWhite and gray, they're like his secret weapons. He uses white to show you something fancy and high class, like,  'Look at Daisy, she's always dripping in white!' But then there's gray, which is like the tired, old version of white. It's like, 'This is all so boring and predictable'. He throws these colors everywhere at the beginning of the book, like, everyone's wearing white, even Gatsby's parties are kinda whitewashed. You see, Fitzgerald, he's setting the stage, building up this whole vibe.\n\nThen, there's all these little details, like, Nick going down \"white chasms\" or people's names being \"gray\" on a list. It's all about uniformity, like, everything is just the same, nothing special.\n\nSo, when Fitzgerald suddenly starts describing Daisy in white again, you get this feeling of, 'Oh, she's not really who she seems, she's just another pretty face in a sea of white'. And that's his point, man. He wants you to see how things aren't always what they seem, how even the prettiest things can be empty.",
            "So, check it out, this place in San Diego County called Potrero is a total paradise for growing stuff. They got sunshine all year round, so they grow all kinds of awesome stuff like tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, even peppers! And get this, people are crazy for organic food here. They got these cool farms where you can join up and get fresh veggies straight from the source, but everyone's always on a waiting list! Organic eggs and milk are like, the hottest thing. Some of these farms are even super chill and let you take tours, go birdwatching, and hike around. It's like a win-win, ya know?  The government's got programs to help farmers who do this kinda stuff, so they can make some dough while helping out the environment. \n\nBut here's the thing, organic farming ain't always easy. It takes a lot of elbow grease to keep those pesky bugs and weeds away without using chemicals. Plus, sometimes things don't grow as well as they do with regular farming. It's like, you gotta put in extra effort to make it work. \n\nNow, this one place in Potrero, it's 160 acres of chaparral, grasslands, and oak trees. It's right next to this huge forest called the Cleveland National Forest, and it's home to all sorts of cool critters, some of them endangered, like kangaroo rats, frogs, and even butterflies. It's been around forever, used by Native Americans first, then ranchers and wood sellers. \n\nI was checking out this website and found this farm nearby that's doing organic stuff. They're killing it! So, I figured this Potrero place could do the same thing.",
            "Listen up, 'cause this is important stuff. When you're dealin' with folks from a different scene, ya gotta get their groove. Culture ain't just some big ol' label, it's like a whole way of life, ya know? Don't go thinkin' everyone from the same place is all the same, 'cause that's a surefire way to mess things up.  Like, sayin' all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are easygoing, that's just plain wrong.\n\nThe real deal is to figure out what makes that culture tick, what's important to 'em, and how that'll play out when you're tryin' to make a deal.  When you're meetin' folks from a different background, you're gonna see things through your own lens, and that's natural. But don't let that cloud your judgment.\n\nTo understand 'em, you gotta dig deep. Learn about their history, their beliefs, their hang-ups. Don't go tryin' to change 'em, just accept 'em for who they are, especially if you're the underdog at the table. And remember, respect goes a long way.  If you show respect for their customs and beliefs, it'll make things a whole lot smoother.\n\nCulture ain't just about countries either.  Even inside a company, there's a whole vibe goin' on.  Some places are all about long hours, others are laid-back. You can tell a lot by how folks dress, how they talk, how they get things done, even how they give back to the community. Just look at how different companies are here in America, from coast to coast, city to suburbs. It's wild how diverse things can be, even in one place.\n\nValues are the real key, though. They're the heart of a culture, the \"why\" behind everything. If a culture values saving face or harmony, you ain't gonna see them embarrassin' their company or boss just to win a deal.  And a culture that's all about tough negotiations? They ain't gonna settle for the first thing that comes along.\n\nSo, before you even sit down at the table, do your homework. Figure out what makes 'em tick, what they value. But don't forget, a little personal touch goes a long way too. Get to know your opponent, show 'em you're more than just a business deal. That's how you make a real connection.",
            "Okay, so these two brainiacs, Anselm and Aquinas, both think there's a Big Guy upstairs, ya know? And they both wanna prove it, like a weird game of one-upmanship. But since I'm way more down-to-earth, lemme break it down for ya.\n\nAnselm, he's all about lookin' inside yourself, like, \"Dude, God's already in your head, so you gotta believe!\" Kinda like when you know your goldfish is hungry even before he starts tappin' on the glass. Anselm thinks faith is the key, no need for all that fancy proof stuff. \n\nThen there's Aquinas, the logic master. He's like, \"Nah, man, I got five solid reasons why God's gotta be real!\" He's talkin' 'bout change, cause and effect, stuff like that. Like, if you see a bunch of pieces of a puzzle, you just KNOW there's a missing one, right? Aquinas says it's the same with God - the universe makes sense 'cause there's gotta be a Big Guy behind it all.\n\nSo, who's got the better argument? Honestly, both of 'em make some pretty good points. But neither one's gonna convince me without a little more than just words, ya know? I need some solid evidence, not just head-scratchin' theories.",
            "Yo, so like, way back in the day, like, super long ago, there was this dude named Buddha, right? He was a prince, but he was all, 'Nah, this royal life ain't for me.' So, he ditched it all and became enlightened. His teachings, they became this big thing called Buddhism. There's a bunch of different types of Buddhism, but the most hardcore one is called Theravada. It's like, over 2,500 years old, and things have changed a bit since Buddha was chillin'.\n\nTake this festival they have in Sri Lanka, for example. They call it the water-cutting ceremony. Monks and regular folks participate, and it's kinda religious, but Buddha never talked about this kinda thing. It's just one example of how Buddhism has evolved over time. It's not just the goofy traditions, but even the deep, core beliefs have changed a little.\n\nWhy? Well, there are a bunch of reasons. Some stuff comes from inside the Buddhist community, like, changes made by monks and regular Buddhists. Other stuff comes from outside, like, people who aren't Buddhist. Sometimes these outside forces are cool, sometimes they're a total drag. \n\nLet's break down some key terms first, 'cause we're gonna use them a lot.  We got 'internal' and 'external' forces. Internal means stuff coming from Buddhists, whether they're monks or not. External means stuff from people outside Buddhism.  Then we have 'hostile' and 'benign'. Hostile forces mess with Buddhism, try to hurt it, or whatever. Benign forces don't really care about Buddhism, they just do their thing, which might accidentally help or hurt Buddhism.  \n\nAlright, now let's get down to the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in the 'Triple Gem': Buddha, the teachings (Dhamma), and the community (Sangha). The Dhamma is basically the holy scriptures, like the Tripitaka.  There's the Sutta Pitaka (Buddha's words), the Vinaya Pitaka (rules for monks), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (the deep, philosophical stuff). \n\nThey talk about things like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (suffering is real), and Anicca (everything's temporary).  You gotta get a handle on these ideas to break free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth.  When you do that, you also ditch all the bad stuff: lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). You become enlightened, like a boss.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. Regular folks have five precepts: don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't mess around sexually, and don't get wasted on drugs. Monks, they've got a whole lotta rules to follow. The most important idea in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths:\n\n1. Life is suffering (Dukkha).\n2. Suffering is caused by attachment.\n3. Suffering can be overcome.\n4. There's a path to overcome suffering (the Eightfold Path).",
            "So, get this: America and Mexico, they were like, totally at odds for, like, forever! I'm talking 57 years, from 1836 to 1893! It was a real thing, man, like a super intense rivalry. Remember that time America went and smashed Mexico in that war back in 1846? Yeah, that was a big deal. America took Texas and all that Southwest land for itself. Boom! Total power move.  \n\nBut it wasn't just about land, ya know? They also butted heads over religion, culture, the whole shebang. Like, imagine being all different and then having to live next door to each other. It's a recipe for disaster, right? \n\nIt's kinda like, you know, when your neighbor's dog keeps digging in your garden. You gotta be all \"Hey, chill out, dude!\" about it. Except instead of a dog, it's a whole country. \n\nAnyway, America and Mexico had their fair share of run-ins, like a whole bunch of them. They were like, \"Nope, not gonna share!\" over stuff like who should be in charge and what's considered cool.  And get this, an old dude named David M. Pletcher said that America's had way more drama with Mexico and Cuba than with any other country. Not cool, man.\n\nReligion was a major sticking point too. Back then, America was all \"We don't dig that Catholicism!\" and Mexico was like, \"Screw you, we're sticking with our faith!\" It's kind of like the whole Cold War thing, but instead of Communism, it was Catholic-phobia. It's like they thought if you didn't believe the same thing, you were the enemy.\n\nAnd guess what? It all stemmed from those old colonial times when England and Spain were at each other's throats.  They passed down all that bad blood to their kids, and America and Mexico just couldn't seem to get over it. \n\nThey fought over borders, stole each other's stuff, and pulled all sorts of shady stuff. It was a mess, man! But eventually, Mexico realized they needed America for stuff, and America wanted to control their economy instead of just taking their land. So, the rivalry fizzled out, but it took a long time.",
            "So, fifteen years back, BAM! I'm hit with this crazy illness out of nowhere. Never even heard of it before!  See, I was a nurse, figured it was the safe bet.  Everyone kept saying, \"You'll always have a job, people get sick all the time!\"  So I did it, even though my real dream was to be a scientist or maybe a journalist, or heck, both!  But here I was, 46, single, no cash in the bank, and totally outta commission.  Now, fifteen years and counting on disability, I've got nothin' left to call my own.  Scrapping by, that's the name of the game. Every day's a fight to keep my head above water, a constant battle for security, safety, and even just my self-respect.\n\nNothing's a sure thing anymore, but here's the deal: without my family and a few awesome friends, I wouldn't have made it this far. Believe me, when disaster hits, strong doesn't even begin to describe it. \n\nLife throws curveballs, big and small, all the time. No amount of planning can stop everything. Some stuff, you just can't handle alone.\n\nWe need to stop relying so much on the government, it's crumbling faster than a stale cookie. But I'd rather see folks helping each other out, building each other up, asking for help when they need it.  \n\nThose Conservatives keep talking about how \"rugged individualism\" built this country, but back in the day, what got folks through tough times wasn't being tough, it was kindness, respect, and sharing what you had. Those pioneers crossing the Rockies? They didn't make it without lookin' out for each other.\n\n\nSo yeah, be prepared. I am. Got my disaster kit, first aid, water purifiers, plastic sheeting for the windows, the whole shebang. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches... you name it, I got it.  If you've got the space and the means, a little farm and some canning supplies?  Go for it!  Wood stove, too, if you're not stuck in an apartment. \n\nBut here's the kicker: get to know your neighbors.",
            "Okay, so, like, why do critters evolve the way they do? Is there some kinda rulebook for evolution, ya know? Back in the day, this dude named D'Arcy Thompson said we're still figuring out how to talk about living things in numbers, and wouldn't ya know it, that's still kinda true. But, lately, folks have been using math to try and understand how shells grow, like, from baby to adult, and how that's changed over time. We're doing the same thing with these cool clams called Prunum. We're taking pictures of their shells, measuring all sorts of stuff, and then using computer programs to make up new shell shapes.  It's like, \"What if a shell did this instead of that?\" Kinda like when you play with LEGOs, but with science! We're also doing experiments to see how these different shapes actually work.\n\nThink of a shell like a spiral staircase that goes all the way around. Each step is a whorl, and they all spin around a central column called the columella. Sometimes the steps get bigger, sometimes they stay the same, and there's a line separating each step, called a suture. Usually, the biggest step is the last one, called the body whorl. The rest of the steps are called the spire, and the very tip is called the apex. And there's a hole at the bottom called the aperture where the clam sticks its head out. \n\nYou can look at a shell from different angles, like from the top, bottom, front, or back.\n\nCounting the whorls is kinda like slicing a cake. You look at the top, find the first line, and then count how many slices there are. We even look at how the opening of the shell changes as it grows. Imagine tracing the path of the opening as the clam builds its shell, that's like a map of its growth! We can even use math to make that map and see what would happen if the clam grew differently. Kinda neat, huh?",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya about Indonesia and their baby peeps.  For the last ten years, things haven't been changin' much when it comes to babies dyin' before they even turn one.  They're doin' alright with stuff like clean water and toilets, but when it comes to keepin' moms and babies healthy, they ain't quite makin' the cut.  \n\nTurns out, they're gettin' better at havin' babies with helpers around, but not all helpers are created equal.  Some are just midwives, and they can't handle tough situations, ya know?  Like when a mama starts bleedin' too much after givin' birth, those midwives are outta their league.  So even though they're makin' progress, it's kinda fake news.  Also, fewer kids are seein' doctors for tummy aches and stuff.  And postnatal care? Forget about it, that's a mess too.\n\nAnd here's the kicker:  cesarean sections are way too low, especially in the country parts.  In the city, they do 'em a decent amount, but in the sticks, not so much.  It's like the rich folks get all the good stuff.  \n\nThe poor folks are strugglin' to get care too, 'cause it costs too much.  \n\nSo what's the answer?  Should they focus on specific programs or fix the whole health system?   Programs are easier, they get results faster, but they can also mess things up.  Like, they might pour all their money into one thing, leaving other stuff to rot. Plus, ya get a bunch of programs doin' the same thing, but all disorganized.  Talk about a headache!",
            "Alright, so Victorian books are all about fancy details and rich folks, right? But then there's these two, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" that kinda break the mold. They're Victorian, but they're like, \"Nope, we're gonna throw in some mystery and weird stuff!\"  It makes the characters way more interesting because we get a peek into their heads and what makes them tick.\n\nLike, take this bit from \"Oliver Twist\":\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nSee, in these stories, things get kinda dreamlike and mysterious, especially with Oliver. It's like a window into his mind, showing us what's hurting him and how he sees the crazy stuff going on around him.\n\nWhen Oliver gets shot, it's like he's reliving it in a nightmare. He's overwhelmed, like he has no control, and everything feels numb. It's scary because it shows how broken he is and how much Fagin has messed with him. It makes you wonder who's really in charge of his fate.\n\n\nIn \"Wuthering Heights,\" it's different, but the mystery is still there. It's more about the darkness and hidden secrets of the characters.",
            "Okay, so picture this: a couple years back, I was helping out at this after-school program, you know, tutoring those little elementary schoolers. I was pretty good at English and reading, so that's what I mostly focused on.  Then this kid, Adrian, comes along. He was in like third or fourth grade, I think, and he was really struggling to read. It was weird, man. Some letters he'd nail, others? Not even close. It was like his brain was playing some kind of  letter-pronouncing game, and it hated him.  See, Adrian was Latino, and he spoke perfect English, which made it even weirder.  We were stuck in this reading rut until one day, Adrian's mom came in.  She didn't speak a lick of English, just Spanish.  My Spanish was like, \"hola\" and \"gracias\" level, but somehow we managed to chat.  BAM! It hit me like a ton of bricks. Adrian wasn't dumb, he just didn't know the English alphabet that well. It was like teaching someone to read using a completely different alphabet. I don't know if that helped him much in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now. \n\nAnyway, that's why I'm bringing this whole language barrier thing up. It's a big deal, especially here in California. It's not always as obvious as you think.  Even a kid who speaks English perfectly can still struggle with reading if they haven't got a good grasp of the alphabet. Everyone knows this is a problem, but what can we do about it? Adrian was kind of a simple case - some extra English reading help, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated.  There's no magic bullet.  Dual language programs, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of it works alone.  We need to mix and match! \n\nFirst off, dual language programs are awesome, not just for kids whose first language is Spanish, but for everyone. Studies show they actually do better in school!  People are scared about this, saying it wastes resources and benefits only a few.  But that's wrong. Think about it - if this was the norm, not the exception, everyone would benefit!\n\nSo how do we do it?  Do we make all teachers bilingual? Nah, that's crazy.  But I think we can have bilingual helpers, tutors, whatever you call them.",
            "From the time we're little munchkins, most folks are told there's somethin' bigger out there, somethin' way beyond our tiny brains. Some get sent to Sunday School, others to Temple, or maybe they just bug out on their own lookin' for answers.  A lotta us just go with whatever religion our parents gave us, but some wise guys, they say \"Nah, there ain't nothin' but this here brain and this here world.\"  We might even change our minds a bunch, findin' new ways to think about things. No matter what, we're all on this quest to figure out who we are, through our own messed up, unique views on what's holy and what ain't. We're all searchin' for a light in the darkness, somethin' to guide us outta the shadows and into the sunshine.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my old man said when I asked him what bird he liked best. We were sittin' on the porch, listenin' to the rain poundin' on the roof like a freakin' drum solo. Water was pourin' down the gutters, drownin' the plants by the steps.  He looked out at the rain, like he was half-searchin' for somethin', half-rememberin'. He'd gotten thinner, clothes hangin' off him like a bad Halloween costume.  His hair was gettin' thinner too, like a spooky, bald spot was comin' for him. He kept lookin' at the rain, wouldn't meet my eyes.  I felt lonely, scared, and couldn't bring myself to talk to him about how much I was gonna miss him.  Talkin' about it woulda made it real, and that was too much for both of us.  So I just hugged him, sat back down, scooted my chair closer, and joined him in watchin' the rain fall on that June night.\n\nMy dad kicked the bucket in December that year, five days after I turned twenty-two.  The chemo and radiation didn't make him feel any better, but it kept him around for a few months longer than the docs thought he'd last.  I couldn't say what good that did, though.  What kinda God does that?  Alone in the dark, I didn't pray.  If God was out there, I figured he stopped listenin' to me ages ago. \n\nI didn't wanna be there when he left this world for whatever came next.  So I wasn't.  Couldn't watch the man who made me fade away.  I wanted to remember him the way he lived, not the way he died. Besides, I knew my dad better than anyone else, better even than his own family.  I knew he wouldn't want me to be some sad spectator at his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waitin' for the news.\n\nNobody even called.",
            "So, get this, people have been yapping about Gothic novels forever. Some say they're a total snoozefest, others think they're the bee's knees, ya know, all \"terrible sublime\" and stuff. This dude Ian Watt, real smart guy, says they're basically a \"weird mix of old and new,\" which kinda makes sense when you think about it.\n\nThis whole thing started with this book, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" by this fella Horace Walpole. He took all these old school, like, super dramatic theatre ideas and mixed them up with the newfangled way of writing novels back then – you know, where you get up close and personal with the characters' minds.  He calls it a \"Gothic story,\" and BAM, the genre was born!\n\nGothic novels are like a throwback to the spooky, medieval vibes, with castles, knights, and all that jazz. But even back then, \"Gothic\" was kinda seen as old-fashioned and clunky compared to the \"modern\" stuff. \n\nBut here's the kicker – even though Gothic is, like, ancient history, it still sticks around because it's got this cool combo of drama and mystery. It's like, both out of date and totally fresh at the same time, which is kinda mind-blowing.\n\nOne big theme in Gothic novels is this thing called chivalry. It's all about knights being brave, honorable, and totally awesome. Gothic writers loved it because they thought modern society was lacking that whole chivalrous vibe.  They used chivalry to make the \"Gothic past\" look super idealized and romantic, kinda like a sneak peek at the future of the Romantic era. \n\nWalpole, the dude who started it all, was writing during some seriously messed up times politically. He was worried sick about the future, and maybe he thought the good ol' days of chivalry were gone for good. In his book, he shows this through his character Frederic, who's basically a perfect knight in shining armor. \n\nHe's a prince, he's been through some serious heartache, and he's supposed to be dead. It's like a dramatic, over-the-top version of a knight, which kinda sets the stage for the whole Gothic trope of going overboard.",
            "Alright, lemme break down this whole \"supply chain\" thing for ya. It's basically how stuff gets from the \"I want it!\" stage all the way to your doorstep. Think of it like a big, crazy race with lots of different players. \n\nThis guy named Keith Oliver, back in 1982, was the first to use the fancy term \"supply chain management.\" He figured out that to make things run smooth and get stuff to folks fast, ya gotta plan ahead, make it happen, and keep an eye on everything. \n\nThere are six main players in this supply chain game: making stuff, getting the stuff, keeping track of the stuff, deciding where stuff goes, moving stuff around, and sharing info about the stuff. Managers gotta juggle all these things to make sure customers are happy.\n\nFirst off, you gotta make the stuff!  That's the \"production\" part. It's like the first step in a big recipe, where you figure out what to make, how much to make, where to make it, and who's gonna do it. Managers gotta know what people want, so they check out the market – that's like lookin' at what's hot and trendy. \n\nOnce they know what folks want, they decide what to produce and how much. Then they gotta pick the best place to make it, making sure it's got everything it needs and can handle the workload. \n\nNext up is \"supply,\" which is all about finding the best people and places to help make your stuff. Maybe ya got different parts of the production process spread out, or maybe ya wanna outsource some stuff to other companies. That's where \"velocity\" comes in – doin' things fast and cheap while still keeping quality high.",

Burma, which is also called Myanmar, is this weird country in Southeast Asia where these guys in charge, the military, they've been running things since 1962.  They're kinda like the bullies of the world, always making trouble and not letting anybody else have a say.  \n\nBack in 2007, a bunch of monks, like the peaceful kind, they decided to stand up to these guys.  It started with these little protests, like, \"Hey, we want a better life!\" But the military, they got all scared and started beating people up.  They even went into the monk's temples and trashed the whole place. It got so bad that journalists who were just trying to do their job got thrown in jail.  One guy, Kenji, he was just taking pictures, and they killed him!  \n\nThis isn't new, though.  Governments have always been like that, trying to boss people around and keep all the power for themselves.  Like, remember those Roman emperors way back when?  They thought they were gods!  And then there's Japan, where the emperor is supposed to be a god too!  And don't even get me started on our president, George W. Bush. He hangs out with this guy, Ted Haggard, who's like the leader of all the dumb people.  \n\nYou know, there have been other times when people have tried to stand up to these bad governments. Like in China, back in 1989, students and stuff, they protested, but the government just crushed them. It's messed up. And in Rwanda, in the 90s, they killed tons of people because of their religion or something.  And of course, there's Hitler, who killed millions of Jews.",

He knew how to write tunes that let each player shine, even if it was just a little solo. He was like a conductor, but he also knew how to make the whole orchestra sound like one big, crazy good instrument. \n\nHeck, he even used voices like instruments in some of his stuff. Like this song \"Creole Love Call\".  It's a slow blues song, and the singer, he's not singing words, he's just making sounds, like an instrument!  It's kinda cool.\n\nThis guy, he knew how to make each player sound their best, and he knew how to make them all sound good together. He wrote some of the coolest, most amazing jazz music ever!  He even used a trumpet guy named Bubber Miley and a singer named Baby Cox to do this thing where they were callin' and respondin' to each other. It was like they were making music with their voices and their horns at the same time.\n\nThen there's this other song, \"It Don't Mean a Thing\".  Ellington had this trombone player, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton. He was a regular in Ellington's band, and in this song, he plays the first note of the song on his trombone, and it's like, BAM!

It started when she was 14, hittin' that awkward teenage phase, and it was still there at 17.  Now, she knew it wasn't somethin' she could just buy, it was somethin' more... someone. But nobody, not a single dude, had ever caught her eye.  Some had tried, bless their hearts, makin' all those goofy moves, but nothin' clicked. She wracked her brain, tryin' to figure out what was up with her. Theories bounced around, but nothin' stuck.

            "Alright, so picture this: there's this super healthy way of eating called the \"Mediterranean Diet,\" but lemme tell ya, it's a bit much for some folks. So, they came up with a simpler version called the 'alternate Mediterranean diet,' (or aMed for short). Basically, it's all about munching on plants like fruits, veggies, nuts, and beans, while keeping the meat and fatty stuff to a minimum. It's like, \"Hey, let's load up on good stuff and ditch the bad!\" \n\nEveryone knows that eating healthy is good for ya, right? Well, some earlier studies showed that folks who followed the Mediterranean Diet had less heart trouble and lived longer. This new study wanted to see if the aMed diet had the same effect, especially when it came to strokes. They followed a bunch of nurses for 20 years, asking 'em about what they ate every few years. And guess what? The nurses who ate the most like their Mediterranean diet buddies had a lower chance of getting heart disease and strokes!  They kept track of everything, like smoking, exercise, and even how many vitamins they popped. It's all about being super careful, ya know?\n\nSo, the study found that the more plants you eat and the less junk you stuff your face with, the less likely you are to have a heart attack or stroke.  Pretty simple, right?",
            "Back in 2007, things got REAL hairy in America. People were losing jobs faster than you can say \"sub-prime mortgage,\" and houses were going for less than a used pizza cutter.  The big money guys, the ones with names like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, they were singing the blues. See, they'd been handing out loans like candy to folks who couldn't really afford 'em –  like giving a goldfish a credit card!  And then, BAM! Those loans went south faster than a fry cook on vacation.  \n\nIt all started way back in the Clinton days, when everyone was feelin' good and the economy was hummin'. The Prez wanted another term, so they loosened up the rules on loans, thinking it'd make everyone happy. But, it was like lettin' loose a pack of rabid squirrels in a china shop.  \n\nSome smart guy over at the New York Times, Steven Holmes, saw what was comin' a mile away. He's like, \"Yo, this is gonna blow up!\" But nobody listened.  \n\nThen came those fancy new mortgage things, like adjustable-rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. They sound complicated, right? That's 'cause they are!  It was like weaving a giant, tangled mess of financial threads, and when one thread snapped, the whole thing started unravelin'.\n\nAnd unravel it did. The housing bubble popped, and all those fancy investment banks were left holdin' the bag. They were in deep doo-doo, like a raccoon in a garbage can. Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers?  Gone. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? Government bailouts, baby!  \n\nSo, there you have it. A bunch of bad decisions, a whole lotta greed, and a dash of economic ignorance led to a real mess.",
            "Okay, so you wanna tell a story, right?  It's like showing off your best moves, painting a picture with words, making your readers go \"Wow!\"  Except, sometimes, you end up droning on and on, like a broken record.  That's exposition, and it's the writer's kryptonite.\n\nSee, we've all heard \"Show, don't tell,\" but sometimes even the best writers get tripped up.  They get caught up in explaining *everything*, turning their story into a boring history lesson.  It's like that friend who always has to tell you *every single detail* about their day, even the boring parts.\n\nExposition is like that friend, except it's your story, and you're the one making everyone yawn.  In movies, it's when a character starts dumping information on another, like they're reading a Wikipedia article aloud.  In books, it's when the author does the same thing.\n\nThink about it this way: you're reading a story, and suddenly you're told the heroine met her soulmate, got married in a huge fancy ceremony, and then BAM! He's murdered right in front of her.  Do you really want to spend two pages reading about it, with only a couple lines of dialogue for each character?\n\nNo way!  You want to *feel* the love they shared, see it in their actions and words, understand why his death is so devastating.  You want to see the heroine's grief, her strength, her vulnerability.  \n\nIt's all about adding depth, making the story come alive.  Instead of just telling us about the husband, let us *experience* him.  Show us his personality, his humor, his flaws.\n\nDon't just tell us the characters met, got married, and he died.  Give us the story behind those events.  Make it real. Make it emotional. Make it unforgettable.",
            "Alright, check this out! I just watched these two news things from Columbus, Ohio, like, totally bogus! First up was NBC 4 this morning, August 13th, 2011, a real live one. They had this story about this dude in Ashley, Ohio, who stabbed his wife, but, like, they didn't even say her name. The creep's name was Shad Hostettler. Man, his mugshot was straight-up scary!  They only talked about it for a couple of minutes, said he stabbed her a bunch of times and got caught, but that was it.\n\nThen they had this thing about this Travis Buyers, 18 years old, got shot in Sharon Woods and was in real bad shape. No arrests, no suspects, just the SWAT Team sniffing around. Seemed kinda short, maybe 'cause it wasn't some white kid or something. It's like, if a white person gets messed with the news freaks out, but if it's a minority, they barely mention it. \n\nNext, they showed this hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, a .22 bullet, some dude shot it! They were offering five grand for info on the shooter. Then, boom, talk about the weather, rain and thunderstorms coming Saturday, just a quickie though, gotta keep you watching, ya know? \n\nThey also had this story about a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. Some dude, black, wearing a hoodie, six-foot, about 150 pounds. They kept saying he was black and how dark his skin was, kinda weird, yeah?\n\nFinally, they talked about this Rene Rodriguez, a drug lord from Texas, doing time for selling weed to Ohio. Instead of saying 25 years, they said \"300 months.\"  What's up with that? And they kept saying he was Hispanic, which didn't really matter to the story, you know?",
            "So, there's this thing about brothers, ya know? It's like, this super strong connection, like nothin' else.  It's got all these crazy feelings mixed up in it - love, pride, jealousy, even anger sometimes.  Brothers get each other, like, *deeply*. They see themselves in their brother, more than anyone else. But sometimes, when things go south, real bad, that bond shows its true colors, good or bad.  And that stuff, those feelings, they can really mess you up.  You gotta deal with the consequences, ya know? 'Cause when you look your brother straight in the eye and see yourself lookin' back, you see the real you, not how people think you are. It's in your actions, what you do, that shows what you're really made of.\n\nThis story, \"The Scarlet Ibis\",  it's all about that brother stuff.  These two guys, they got this intense connection, but it's messed up, kinda.  They're in this place, all beautiful and green, and they're on this crazy trip that ain't gonna end well.  There's this big fight, pride and disappointment clashing, and only one of 'em makes it out alive.\n\nThe story uses these brothers, Doodle and the narrator, to show how messed up this whole thing can get. The narrator, he's all about pride, from the start. He wants a brother who can keep up with him, someone who can do all the cool stuff he wants to do. Doodle, though, he's different. He's weak, can barely walk, and he's doomed from the start. The narrator's dreams, they get crushed.  He even thinks about killing Doodle, can you believe that? But then Doodle smiles at him, and... well, that changes things. It shows that deep down, he loves his brother, even if he's a pain in the neck sometimes.",
            "Yo, check it! This brain thing is wild, right? Back in the day, folks thought it was like a wax tablet, then papyrus, then a book, and now they're sayin' it's like a computer. But hold up! Don't get too caught up in these comparisons, 'cause they don't tell the whole story. \n\nSee, this brain of yours, it's like a total info-processing machine. It grabs stuff from your senses – touch, sound, sight – and turns it into electrical signals. Then it's like a crazy remix, all these signals bouncing around, getting analyzed from different angles. It's called bottom-up and top-down processing. Imagine you see a black box on a white background. Bottom-up is like figuring out the basics: \"Hey, there's a shape, it's black, it's on a white thing.\" Top-down is like using your brainpower to go, \"Aha! It's a box!\"\n\nBut here's the kicker: your brain's got this filter, like a bouncer at a club, deciding what's important and what gets tossed aside. You see tons of grass when you look down, but your brain's like, \"Nah, not worth remembering.\" But if someone shouts your name in a crowd, bam! It's front and center. So it's all about prioritizing, yo!\n\nAnd speaking of remembering, your brain's got different storage compartments: sensory, working, and long-term. It's like filing cabinets, each with its own purpose. Sensory memory is fleeting, like a passing thought. Working memory holds stuff for a short while, like remembering a phone number. Long-term memory is the big vault, where all your experiences and knowledge chill. \n\nBut how's all this knowledge organized? That's a big mystery. Some say it's like a network, with ideas connected like branches on a tree. Others think it's more like a giant puzzle, with pieces fitting together in complex ways. \n\nIt's a wild ride, this brain thing, but it's what makes us, well, us.",
            "Yo, check it! This book, \"Brave New World,\" by Huxley, is totally dissing technology and the whole capitalist system. It's set up like a messed-up future where everyone's all about being part of the group and chasing instant happiness. They're basically puppets, man, dancing to the tune of the World Controller. This dude's got all the power, and he's running the show.\n\nThis book's got some deep stuff going on, like this Marxist thing. You know, it talks about how society's rigged, how everyone's the same, man, and how the rich guys are totally screwing over the poor folks. It's like Huxley saw the future and was like, \"Whoa, this is messed up!\"\n\nHe's using this thing called \"false consciousness,\" which basically means the people are so busy chasing stuff they don't even realize they're being manipulated. They're all about buying stuff and getting their kicks, but they don't see the big picture. It's like they're brainwashed! The World Controller's like the ultimate puppet master, controlling everything from the get-go.\n\nAnd it's not just about money, man. It's about power. The rich guys are on top, and they keep the poor guys down. It's a total power trip.\n\nBut here's the kicker: the people in this book, they don't even care! They're so used to being controlled that they don't even question it. They're like, \"Yeah, this is how it's supposed to be.\" It's freakin' scary, man.\n\nThey don't have real relationships or feelings. They're all just shallow and superficial. It's like Huxley's saying that technology and capitalism are killing our humanity. We're becoming robots, man, just like the ones in that crazy future!",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this campus, man. I've been here for like, two and a half years, which is, like, four and a half semesters in their weird college speak. Getting around this place is a total drag, lemme tell ya. My first year I was stuck in these East Halls dorms, way out on the edge of campus, like, you could practically see the stadium from there.  Getting to class, especially to those places like Willard, which is like, in the middle of everything, was a freakin' marathon, especially when the weather decided to act up, which, let's be real, is, like, all the time here in State College. \n\nSo, I was chatting with this old grad, not much older than me, and he told me that back in the day, East Halls was like, totally isolated. There was, like, this massive wasteland between it and the rest of the campus. Now, it's all filled up with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. It's like they just keep expanding this place, making it even harder to get from point A to point B.\n\nWhat's the answer to this mobility mess? Bikes, man!  Bikes are the way to go. But it's not just about having the bike; the campus needs to be built for bikers. This friend of mine, he got back into biking after, like, a long break, and he was all, \"Dude, why did I ever stop?\" He was like, \"Bikes are the only way to get around.\" \n\nBesides being good for your bod, bikes are the most efficient way to travel.  A bowl of oatmeal and some pedaling and you're good for, like, 30 miles.\n\nNow, I live off campus, just as far out as some dorms.  The smartest move I made this year? Buying a bike. My classes are in Thomas building, which is, like, a 25-minute walk from my place. On a bike? Five minutes, tops, if I push it.  The only problem? Pollock Road, the quickest way to Thomas, is, like, a pain in the butt, whether you're on a bike or walking. \n\nWalking's cool too, but I'm too busy for that. Without my bike, walking would be my only option, and that's, like, a whole other story. Walking to Thomas every day would add, like, 30-40 minutes to my day. That's, like, two and a half hours a week! And that's just Thomas. Add everything else, all the other classes, appointments, and stuff, and that's way too much time wasted."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "SA2B here!  So, I'm thinkin' about becoming a social worker, y'know, helpin' out the little guys who got it rough. Kids who've been through the wringer, families messin' up, that kinda thing.  I figure, I can offer a few things to the social work game. First off, I'm all about helpin' people, always have been. Secondly, I treat everyone with respect, no matter what. And, I'm a straight-shooter, always doin' the right thing. I wanna make things better for folks, not just in their lives, but for myself too. Gotta keep learnin' and growin' to be the best I can be.\n\nSee, I always wanted to do somethin' to make a difference, but wasn't sure how.  Went through high school and college, saw a lot of folks runnin' from their problems, makin' bad choices.  That's why I got my psychology degree, figured it would give me some tools to help.\n\nThen one day, this friend of mine had this kid, just sixteen, all nervous, stayin' on her couch. Turns out, he was runnin' from some messed-up parents. Next day, heard he'd called the cops. Figured I'd lend a hand, so I went over to his folks' place. Talked to the cops, told 'em about my degree and my concerns. They wanted me to talk to the parents, said there wasn't much they could do.\n\nWell, when I talked to the parents, they were all jumpy, makin' excuses for how their son was just \"manipulative\" for gettin' the cops involved. It was a \"simple\" family fight, they said.  That's when it hit me, that's what I wanna do, help these kids who are stuck in these messed-up situations. \n\nSocial work ain't just about helpin' kids, though. It's about standin' up for what's right, fightin' for those who can't fight for themselves. You know, like when folks say everyone's an individual, but then they wanna make everyone fit in the same mold? That ain't right. I'm unique, and I wanna see everyone else be unique too.\n\nBack in high school and college, I did my part. Dyed my hair crazy colors, wore what I wanted, pierced my ears, joined the GSBA, spoke up against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it.  That's what social justice is all about, standin' up for what's right, even when it's hard. And I'm gonna keep doin' it.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this thing called insomnia, see? Some folks think it's all in your genes or your body, kinda like a bug in the system. They call that the \"biological\" model. Others say it's more about where you're from, who your folks are, and the whole shebang of life's craziness. That's the \"sociocultural\" model.\n\nSo, to figure this thing out, we gotta look at both sides. Like, some folks have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep (that's insomnia, plain and simple). Others sleep way too much, or fall asleep at random times (that's the hypersomnia crew). Then there's folks who have crazy dreams, sleepwalk, or even talk in their sleep. It's a real mixed bag!\n\nNow, the \"biological\" folks say it's all about these tiny things in your brain called neurons. They fire and they don't fire, and that's what makes you sleep or wake up.  This one study used mice, see, and they found these special neurons that control sleep. When these neurons get messed up, bam! You've got trouble sleeping. \n\nThe \"sociocultural\" folks say it's more about your environment. Where you live, who you hang out with, even your job can affect your sleep. It's like this big web of stuff that all works together.",
            "Hey there! So, let's talk about this thing called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short.  It's kinda like, your brain has trouble understanding what your ears are hearing, even if you can hear just fine. Imagine trying to sort out a bunch of noisy voices in a crowded room – that's what it's like for folks with CAPD. \n\nThis wasn't always called CAPD, though. Back in the 50s, they called it \"auditory imperception.\"  A bunch of smart folks started figuring out how it works, like these researchers in Italy and a guy named Kimura. They came up with tests to see if a kid's brain was processing sounds the way it should.  \n\nCAPD can show up in all sorts of ways.  Maybe someone has trouble hearing sounds from different directions, or they can't tell the difference between similar sounds, like \"cat\" and \"hat.\" They might also have a hard time understanding speech when there's a lot of background noise, or they might not pick up on changes in tone, like when someone's being sarcastic.  It's like their brain is missing some of the clues!\n\nSo, how do you know if someone has CAPD? Well, there are these special tests that audiologists and speech therapists give. They might ask you to listen to different sounds and tell them what you hear, or they might watch how you respond to different kinds of auditory information.  There's no one magic test, though, and we don't know exactly what causes CAPD.",

The problem is, dropping the act can mess things up with your peeps. Some folks won't care, but others, they'll be ticked off about the whole charade.  It's like, do you keep up the lie to protect yourself, or do you risk hurting the people you care about? Tough choice, right?\n\nThis whole disguise thing gets even weirder when it comes to switching genders, like Viola did. Why'd she do it? Safety, I guess.

It's a whole mess of feelings!\n\nTwelfth Night makes you think, though. Maybe all this pretending helps people figure out what they REALLY feel. Like, is Olivia into guys or gals? Or maybe  Orsino's just confused about his own feelings? Viola's disguise kinda forces them to deal with stuff they've been ignoring.\n\nBut here's the kicker: Olivia's kinda quick to move on from Viola/Cesario to Sebastian, her twin bro. She seems more interested in looks than anything else.  Maybe she's just playing the game, ya know, like everyone else in this crazy play.",
            "Alright, so lemme tell ya about this German place they called a \"colony,\" right?  It was a real mess, especially in this place called South West Africa, now Namibia.  They were real meanies to the locals, like the Ovaherero and Nama folks,  kinda like a really bad bully. But hey, not all Germans were bad, ya know? Some were actually kinda cool.  Like in East Africa, they built schools and stuff for the local folks.  But in South West Africa, it was like, \"nah, we ain't doin' that.\" They left it all up to these church groups, and they didn't give 'em much dough.  They did spend a ton of money on schools for the white folks though. Weird, right?  \n\nAnyway, this messed up the whole place, even after the Germans were gone.  East Africa had lots of smart folks, but in South West Africa, most people couldn't read or write.   There are these books about this stuff, written way back when, mostly in German.  They just kinda describe what was goin' on.  Later, some folks wrote more books in English, comparing all the different colonies. They figured out that South West Africa was different 'cause there were a lot more white folks livin' there.   One guy, Cohen, wrote a whole thing about this, sayin' it all comes down to how many white folks were there.   It was mostly hot and dry, but still, a bunch of white folks settled there. By 1913, there were almost 15,000 of them, way more than in any other colony.",
            "Man, music's gotten wild over the last hundred years, right? Like, there are so many different types now it's hard to keep track.

People have been messing with metal since day one,  always trying to make it weirder and wilder. It's like a chain reaction, man!  One band does something new, and then a bunch of other bands are like, \"Whoa, that's cool, let's take it even further!\" And that's how we got all these crazy sub-genres, and sub-sub-genres, and who knows what else.  \n\nNow, it's so hard to say what metal *is* anymore. It's like a melting pot of everything. But it all started somewhere, right? To get the whole picture, we gotta look back at what metal is really about.\n\nIt's more than just a bunch of loud music. It's a whole movement, a whole attitude. It's like a scream into the darkness. You got the heavy bass, the crushing volume, the wild energy, the crazy shows... It's like metal bands are saying, \"We're not messing around, we're here to make you FEEL something!\" And they're not afraid to get intense, man. They really know their instruments, and they're not afraid to show off.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the drugs, dude. Back in the 70s, everyone was tripping out on all sorts of stuff, and it totally influenced the music.  Metal became a way to express that wild, chaotic energy.  It was like, \"Hey, we're not afraid of the dark side, we embrace it!\"\n\nAnd you know what? It's still going strong today. Metal bands are still pushing boundaries, still exploring the darkest corners of the human experience. It's a pretty amazing thing, when you think about it.",
            "Okay, so check this out. This dude, Henri Rousseau, painted like crazy back in the day, way before all those other weirdos were painting their weird dreams.  He's like, a Post-Impressionist, you know, one of those guys who did his own thing.  He had this painting, *The Dream*,  it's from 1910, and it's about this girl totally blown away by this crazy dreamland. But get this, it's also about Rousseau's own dreams, like, what he wanted to be and all that jazz. \n\nSee, this dude dreamed of being a big shot artist, like, everyone loving his stuff and all that. But here's the catch:  he had this major inner struggle.  Should he paint like everyone else to get famous, or should he just do his own thing and be unique? *The Dream* is like his whole life story, y'know?\n\nRousseau, this guy, he was born way back in 1844, in France. His dad was a business kinda guy, and Rousseau, he didn't go to art school or nothin'. He was working for the government, like collecting tolls or somethin'. He even had this nickname, \"douanier,\" which is like a customs inspector.  Life wasn't easy for him. He lost his first wife and a bunch of kids.  So, he decided to paint, to make himself feel better, I guess. \n\nHe really wanted to be accepted by the art world, which is understandable, right?  He wasn't a fancy art school guy, he started painting later in life, and there were tons of other crazy talented artists around.  He even started getting noticed around the same time as Matisse, who was already a superstar. This guy Gordon wrote a book about French painters, and he says that Matisse was all about avoiding boring art, while Rousseau just wanted to paint something so \"normal\" that people would finally like him.",
            "So, get this, right? A bunch of brainy folks have been saying that ethics and art, truth and beauty, are like, totally connected. And you know what? I kinda agree. Like, Keats, that poet dude, he said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"  We learn stuff through school and stuff, but  ethics and art, they just kinda...click with us, ya know? It's not like we're taught to appreciate a good painting or a good deed, it just happens. \n\nThink about it. We try to explain why something's art or why something's right, but can we really?  Like, we can talk about the Mona Lisa's colors and stuff, but that doesn't explain why it's so darn cool.  It's like when someone asks about your favorite book or song, you just kinda go, \"There's just something about it...\"  Art and morals, they're more than just rules or explanations, ya know? They're kinda like...transcendent, like there's this extra something special they got.  \n\nFlannery O'Connor, she said stories are like, the only way to say some things, 'cause words just can't do it justice. Same with art and morals, there's this thing they got that goes beyond what you can put into words.\n\nSee, it's like we feel art and morals deep down, in this way that's hard to explain.  It's like, beyond our normal thinking, ya know? And literature, man, it's extra special 'cause it deals with values, with what's important in life. It's like life itself, full of stuff we gotta figure out.\n\nSo, yeah, I think art and morals are super connected 'cause they both hit us in this deep, meaningful way that words can't always capture.",
            "Hey, check this out! Germany today is a total powerhouse, a country with its own awesome vibe, from the mountains near Munich to the Baltic Sea in Kiel. It's like one big party, all the way from Cologne on the Rhine River to Dresden by the Elbe. With a culture so unique, it makes sense that Germany, as we know it, came from all sorts of different groups and tribes. \n\nThe place where it all started is called Germania, the homeland of the Germans. Where the name came from, though, is a mystery! Some say it's from a tribe called the Tungrians, who were like, \"Yo, we're the Germans now!\" before they crossed the Rhine and messed with the Gauls (according to Tacitus, a guy who wrote stuff a long time ago).  Julius Caesar, the guy who fought the Gauls and wrote about it, was the first to use the word \"Germanus\" to talk about these tough guys. He used it to tell the difference between the Gauls he beat and the Germans he hadn't conquered yet. Some think it came from a word the Gauls used for \"neighbor,\" but who knows for sure? Caesar said in his book about the Gallic Wars that the Germans were always fighting the Gauls, like it was their daily routine (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others think it comes from the spear the Germans used, called a \"ger,\" or maybe from an old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" because Germans are loud, you know?\n\nThis Roman dude named Tacitus, who wrote stuff way back in AD 98, said the Germans were pure and hadn't mixed with other people, like they just appeared out of nowhere. He's like, \"Why would anyone leave Asia or Africa for a place like Germany? It's wild, the weather is bad, and the people are grumpy!\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nThe Romans didn't really want to live in Germania, but they did send folks there to get stuff and fight sometimes. They mostly stayed in their own big empire. Meanwhile, the Germans hung out on the edge of Rome's territory, trading their stuff and even joining the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "So there I was, staring down at this thing, my brain just kind of...spinning. I wasn't really *feeling* anything, just kinda watching it like a scientist, you know?  Thoughts were popping up and disappearing faster than I could catch them. It was like my brain was on autopilot, just soaking up the sight in front of me.\n\nRemember that art book I got, the one about drawing with your \"right brain\"?  \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" or something like that.  It taught you how to actually *see* things, like breaking down a whole scene, a kitchen with a fruit bowl and everything, into just that bowl of fruit.  That's what I was trying to do here, but my brain was overloaded.\n\nI mean, Picasso had his blue period, Monet loved painting his gardens, and all those Renaissance guys were all about the colors. I was thinking, maybe this is my thing, my \"Work in Brown.\"  My masterpiece.\n\nI grabbed my weapon of choice - a mop - and got ready to create. My hand was steady, my mind focused. I could almost feel the artistic energy flowing through me.  The water swirled, so smooth and clear...then I whacked the toilet handle, and that's when it hit me.  This wasn't a masterpiece, it was a pile of brown mush someone left as a message for the poor schmuck who had to clean it. \n\nI flushed again, took a deep breath, and tried to focus.  I wrapped the toilet paper around my hand like a glove, ready to face the brown beast.  Why did people do this to others? It was like they were saying, \"Hey, enjoy your day! Here's a little gift!\"  A gift of poop.",
            "Yo, check it! Teenagers are gettin' themselves killed behind the wheel, man. It's a real bummer.  \n\nSee, the thing is, their brains ain't fully cooked yet for all the craziness of driving. And, let's face it, they're newbies at this whole driving thing.  They crash more, spin out, speed like maniacs, and even go off the road more often.\n\nAnd guess what? They're more likely to crash when they're cruisin' with their buddies – which, you know, is like, totally normal for teens. Some smart folks in California did a study and found the younger the passenger, the more likely they were to get into a fender bender.\n\nSo, states like California have tried to make things safer by giving teenagers these temporary licenses that limit their driving hours and who they can have in the car.  \n\nBut, let's be real, those temporary licenses are just a bandaid on a bullet hole. The real problem is that young drivers, as a group, just aren't ready for the responsibility, man. One psychologist dude, Marvin Zuckerman, even thinks 18 is too young to get a full license. He says young people, especially those under 20, just crave that adrenaline rush, you know? They love to push the limits.\n\nSo, maybe we should wait until that thrill-seeking fades a bit before handing them the keys. If we keep giving licenses to young teens, we're gonna see even more accidents, and the death toll is gonna be outta control.  \n\nThink about it – in a few years, all those baby boomers' kids are gonna be old enough to drive, and it's gonna be a whole mess.\n\nWe need to get serious about this. Schools can still teach them about driving, but no one under 18 should be behind the wheel.  We can still have those temporary licenses and make them log some practice hours with a grown-up.\n\nWe need to make this a national thing, man. It's not like anyone's coming up with a new idea here. Just gotta make it happen.",
            "So, I was  checking out some old Edison flicks at the Library of Congress, you know, the ones from way back in the day, like the 1890s and early 1900s.  There were a bunch of these  \"trick films\" -  they were all about pullin' the wool over your eyes with crazy editing. I spent a good while figuring out how they did their magic, how they made things appear and disappear, and what made some of those later films stand out from the crowd. \n\nMost of these early trick films were like little stages, all set up in front of a camera.  They never moved the camera around, just kept it fixed like you'd see in a play.  They stuck to long shots and the occasional medium shot, never getting up close and personal like we do today.  And get this - each trick was usually just one long shot, kinda like a continuous performance.\n\nThey really leaned into that stage vibe, just like vaudeville or magic shows.  The actors would walk side-to-side, never coming forward or backward towards the camera. It was like they were stuck in a box, ya know?  Take \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" for example, everyone just shuffled back and forth.\n\nAnd because they didn't move close to the camera, they never used close-ups.  It was all about seeing the whole picture at once, just like in a live performance.\n\nBecause each trick was basically one long shot, the whole film was usually super short, maybe a minute or less.  Most of them were just a quick series of tricks, like magic, disappearing acts, or switching stuff around. It wasn't really about telling a story, more like a bunch of mini-acts strung together.  Oh, but here's the sneaky part - what looks like one shot to you might actually be a bunch of shots glued together to make the illusion work. Check out \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" - it looks like one long shot, but if you look closer, you'll see where they secretly switched out Mary's head!",
            "Alright, listen up! This guy John Taylor, real stickler for freedom, especially when it came to farming.  He was all about folks doing their own thing, no government meddling.  He thought farming was the best gig ever, and that's what shaped his whole take on how things should run.  He wanted a government that said \"Hey, you do your thing, we'll do ours, and let's keep it that way.\"\n\nHe thought America had a clean slate, no old traditions getting in the way. That meant they could build a government that worked for everyone, based on the idea that everyone's got basic rights that no one can mess with.  He was big on those \"natural rights\" – like, if one gets squashed, they all get squashed, ya know?  No way the government should be messing with those.  \n\nJohn thought the government should be like this cautious guardian, keeping the good stuff from getting messed up and stopping the bad stuff from going too far.  He believed folks are good at heart, but also kinda sneaky, always looking out for number one.  That's why he wanted a government that protected your stuff, helped farmers out, and kept things fair.\n\nHe was all about sticking to the Constitution, too. No fancy interpretations, just plain words.  He thought the government should be small and leave folks alone, but not so small that it couldn't keep things in line. He even thought the Declaration of Independence was more important 'cause it showed the states were in charge, not some big ol' national government.",
            "Okay, so check it out. We had this whole tracker for people who were ditching their cars and trying out other ways to get around campus, right? Well, things were totally rad at first, but then BAM!  Around month three, the number of folks logging their trips dropped like a rock. Kinda bummed us out, to be honest.\n\nSee, winter hit our college town, and everyone's less likely to bike or walk when it's freezing. Plus, December is crazy busy with schoolwork and holiday stuff. Who can be bothered with logging their commute when they're stressed out? And then, boom, holidays hit, and everyone's gone!\n\nEven after things calmed down in January, the log submissions didn't really pick up.  I guess sometimes projects just lose steam after the initial hype.  \n\nSo, we decided to throw a \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March.  We gave out prizes like gift certificates to local shops and restaurants – you know, the usual stuff. It kinda worked, but it was kinda like trying to keep a goldfish swimming upstream.  We learned that keeping people engaged is a real challenge, especially with holidays and school breaks messing with the flow.\n\nAnother thing we learned is that people love their cars! It's like a cultural thing. So, we gotta come up with some seriously awesome incentives to get folks ditching their rides. You know, like a sweet new bike, a hybrid car, or even a killer electric car! Maybe that would have kept things exciting. \n\nHonestly, the prizes we had were cool at first, but maybe we should have upped the ante as the project went on. Imagine if we had announced a couple of bikes in December, then a whole hybrid car in January… I bet people would have been all over it!",
            "Yo, lemme break down this ETF thing for ya.  It's like a basket of investments, kinda like a mutual fund, but you can buy and sell it on the stock market like a regular stock.  You get the good stuff from both worlds:  diversification like a fund, but you can play the game like a stockbroker, ya know?   Short selling, margin buying, all that jazz. Plus, ETFs usually cost way less than mutual funds.   \n\nBut hold up, there's a catch. You gotta pay a fee every time you buy or sell, just like with stocks. And don't get me wrong, there are tons of different ETFs out there, so you gotta do your homework and figure out which one's right for you.  \n\nNow, let's talk about this IHF ETF. I'm gonna look at its top ten holdings, which make up a big chunk of the whole thing.  My buddy Gage's dad got a hold of this thing called \"HULK\" on DVD, but I already saw it in the theater.  Anyway, I wanna see if owning just these top ten stocks is better than owning the whole ETF.\n\nLet's see if these stocks really hold up their end of the bargain.  I'm gonna compare their returns and risk (that's the \"Beta\" stuff) to the whole ETF.  \n\nTurns out, owning just those top ten stocks could give you a bigger return and less risk!  But hey, maybe I'm wrong.  We gotta do some fancy math to make sure those differences are real, ya know?\n\nSo, I'm gonna check the \"standard deviation\" of each of those stocks to see how they shake out compared to the whole ETF.  That'll tell me if owning those ten stocks is really a better deal than the whole shebang.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya about this poem, \"Dream-Land,\" by Edgar Allan Poe. It's one of his favorites, ya know? He uses this word \"Thulé,\" twice in the poem, and it's a big deal. This word goes way back to Virgil, an old-school dude who wrote about an island way up north, where everyone thought the world ended. Virgil used it, for sure, but Poe was a big fan of German writers, especially this guy Goethe. Now, this Goethe dude wrote this epic poem called \"Faust,\" and it's super famous.  One part of \"Faust\" has a poem called \"The King of Thulé,\" and it's about this king who loses his wife and goes totally bonkers, drinking himself to death.\n\nSome folks say Poe was basically copying Goethe's style, especially since they both talk about this gloomy place called Thulé.  Poe even uses it twice in his \"Dream-Land,\" like bookends, ya know?  \n\nPoe's \"Dream-Land\" is all about this dark, lonely place, with dead friends haunting him, and everything's gray and lifeless. Kinda like the king in Goethe's poem, he's lost his wife and his will to live. It's like Poe stepped right into Goethe's poem. \n\nPoe loved German stuff, and he was a big fan of Tennyson, who was also into Goethe. So, Poe probably knew about Goethe's work even if he didn't directly copy him.",
            "So, picture this: there's this chick, Jennifer, right? She goes to D&D grocery store, steps on some applesauce, BAM! Takes a spill and hurts her back real bad. Now, she's sayin' the store manager, Martin, shoulda known better 'cause folks had been slipping on spills before. See, two employees told him about the applesauce mess, but he was busy eatin' dinner and said \"Nah, not my problem.\" Half an hour later, BAM! Jennifer goes down.\n\nNow, Jennifer's lawyer's sayin' Martin acted real shady. They're talkin' 'bout \"punitive damages,\" which means extra money to punish the store for bein' jerks. \n\nThey're sayin' Martin knew folks were slipping and didn't care.  They say he acted like a total jerk, like he wanted Jennifer to get hurt. \n\nThe judge ain't gonna throw this case out just yet, 'cause Jennifer's got some points. She can say that Martin knew spills were a problem, and he didn't do nothin' about it. Even though it might not be as clear-cut as \"Martin wanted Jennifer to fall,\"  it's still a decent argument. \n\nIt all started back in October of 2009. Rich Wayne, a D&D employee, told Martin about the applesauce spill. Martin was all, \"Dude, I'm busy eatin', deal with it yourself.\"  Then, Mary J. Haddigan, another worker, tells him again, and Martin gives the same lazy answer.  Well, half an hour later, Jennifer slips and breaks her back.  And get this,  five people already fell and got hurt that year because of spills!  \n\nSo, now Jennifer's takin' D&D to court, wantin' money for her pain and suffering, plus some extra dough to punish them for bein' reckless.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this Islam class I took like, four years back at CBC. We were always going back and forth about whether Islam was, like, a bad religion or not.  It's even more messed up now than back then, ya know? Since 9/11, the media went from all \"Islam is bad!\" to \"Islam is awesome!\" like, overnight. I mean, back in 2001, could ya even imagine a prez running with a name like Barack Obama, who's got a Muslim family history? \n\nThis Muhammad dude's story really got me thinking. See, I thought he was all about forcing people to convert, conquering tribes and making 'em Muslim. But this book paints him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble.  It's like he's the good guy who just, ya know, spread the truth, and people came to him on their own. \n\nThere's even some stuff that's kinda like Jesus' story, like when Muhammad, like, multiplied some mutton and milk for forty guys. It's all super shady, ya know? Like they're trying to make Muhammad look like some kind of miracle worker, to, like, steal Jesus' thunder.\n\nAnd get this, they got all these stories about how people converted, but they're all secondhand.  It's like, \"So-and-so heard from so-and-so who heard from...\" It's all fishy, man.\n\nThe worst part is, they're trying to make Muhammad out to be this perfect, humble, wise dude. But history says different. Muhammad was a warrior, man!  I just wonder if Muslims today know the real deal about this guy.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin' 'bout Christianity.  It's like this, Jesus had his own way of doin' things, ya know?  But then, after he was gone, things started to change. Kinda like when you leave a pizza out too long - it gets all weird and different. Christianity went on its own wild ride, gettin' further and further from Jesus' original message.\n\nNow, these days, everyone's all about change, right?  They wanna try new things and break the rules.  But there are still some folks stuck in the old ways, clingin' to what they know. They ain't gonna let go easy.\n\nBut here's the thing: more and more people are gonna start lookin' back, seein' all the stuff that got added to Christianity over the years. They're gonna wanna know what Jesus really meant, what he truly taught.  It might take a while, maybe decades, maybe even centuries, but it's gonna happen.\n\nThink of it like rewindin' a tape.  Christianity's gonna go back to its roots, strip away all the extra stuff, until it's just Jesus' pure teachings. People are gonna be like, \"Hey, remember when things were simpler?\"  And they'll start worshipin' like they did back in Jesus' time, just followin' his lead.\n\nThe church will still be around, leadin' the way, but everything's gonna be different.  All the different groups and denominations, they'll start to look more and more alike. It's like when the Roman Empire went from crushin' Christians to bein' ruled by 'em.\n\nHistory's full of these big shifts, y'know? It's like a rollercoaster, goin' up and down, changin' direction. And this next big shift's gonna be all about Christianity, goin' back to its original form, gettin' rid of all the extra stuff, and bringin' everyone together. \n\nAnd get this, a big part of it's gonna be seein' Jesus' words in a new way, like metaphors, not just plain ol' instructions.  It's like, he was tryin' to tell us somethin' deeper, somethin' we gotta figure out on our own.\n\nSo what happened after Jesus? Well, way back when, there was just Judaism. That was the start of it all, ya know? One God, the Bible, that's what it was all about.  The Jews, they weren't all on the same page, though. They had their different groups, like the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, and so on.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin' about this book, *The Jungle*. It's a real eye-opener, man. It shows how humans, deep down, are kinda selfish, ya know? They're all about lookin' out for number one and makin' their lives better, but they don't care about anyone else, especially if that someone's lower on the food chain.\n\nYou see it everywhere in the book, especially with those factory owners and bosses. All they care about is makin' their companies bigger and richer, no matter what. They don't give a hoot about the people workin' for them or the damage they're doin' to the environment.\n\nSinclair, the guy who wrote it, paints a pretty grim picture. He describes these factories like giant, smokin' monsters, spewin' out pollution and stink.  He's sayin' these guys don't care about the people, the animals, nothin'!\n\nAnd those bosses? Forget about it! They treat their workers like dirt.  They make 'em work long hours, then just fire 'em without a second thought. No help, no nothin'. It's like they're slaves, trapped in this system with no way out.  \n\nThere weren't many rules back then to protect people, so these guys could get away with anything.  They pushed their workers to the limit, made 'em work in awful conditions. It's messed up, man. They expected people to just take it, to die in those factories or whatever.\n\nEven the unions weren't much help. They were more about makin' money off the workers than actually standin' up for 'em.\n\nIt's a tough story, but it shows a dark side of humanity. It makes you think about how we treat each other, how we let greed and power corrupt us.",
            "Okay, so like, some writers, ya know, they use super cool tricks to make you feel a certain way about stuff. It's like, they're trying to plant a vibe. Fitzgerald, the dude who wrote *The Great Gatsby*, he's a master at this. He's like, 'Hey, let's pair up some random words, just to see what kinda crazy feeling it makes'. He also loves using symbols, like colors, to sneak in these extra meanings.  \n\nTake colors, for example: gold, green, white, gray, even red and pink. Fitzgerald, he's got a whole system going on with these colors, and he uses them to give you a sneak peek into what's really important in the story.\n\nWhite and gray, they're like his secret weapons. He uses white to show you something fancy and high class, like,  'Look at Daisy, she's always dripping in white!' But then there's gray, which is like the tired, old version of white. It's like, 'This is all so boring and predictable'. He throws these colors everywhere at the beginning of the book, like, everyone's wearing white, even Gatsby's parties are kinda whitewashed. You see, Fitzgerald, he's setting the stage, building up this whole vibe.\n\nThen, there's all these little details, like, Nick going down \"white chasms\" or people's names being \"gray\" on a list. It's all about uniformity, like, everything is just the same, nothing special.\n\nSo, when Fitzgerald suddenly starts describing Daisy in white again, you get this feeling of, 'Oh, she's not really who she seems, she's just another pretty face in a sea of white'. And that's his point, man. He wants you to see how things aren't always what they seem, how even the prettiest things can be empty.",
            "So, check it out, this place in San Diego County called Potrero is a total paradise for growing stuff. They got sunshine all year round, so they grow all kinds of awesome stuff like tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, even peppers! And get this, people are crazy for organic food here. They got these cool farms where you can join up and get fresh veggies straight from the source, but everyone's always on a waiting list! Organic eggs and milk are like, the hottest thing. Some of these farms are even super chill and let you take tours, go birdwatching, and hike around. It's like a win-win, ya know?  The government's got programs to help farmers who do this kinda stuff, so they can make some dough while helping out the environment. \n\nBut here's the thing, organic farming ain't always easy. It takes a lot of elbow grease to keep those pesky bugs and weeds away without using chemicals. Plus, sometimes things don't grow as well as they do with regular farming. It's like, you gotta put in extra effort to make it work. \n\nNow, this one place in Potrero, it's 160 acres of chaparral, grasslands, and oak trees. It's right next to this huge forest called the Cleveland National Forest, and it's home to all sorts of cool critters, some of them endangered, like kangaroo rats, frogs, and even butterflies. It's been around forever, used by Native Americans first, then ranchers and wood sellers. \n\nI was checking out this website and found this farm nearby that's doing organic stuff. They're killing it! So, I figured this Potrero place could do the same thing.",
            "Listen up, 'cause this is important stuff. When you're dealin' with folks from a different scene, ya gotta get their groove. Culture ain't just some big ol' label, it's like a whole way of life, ya know? Don't go thinkin' everyone from the same place is all the same, 'cause that's a surefire way to mess things up.  Like, sayin' all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are easygoing, that's just plain wrong.\n\nThe real deal is to figure out what makes that culture tick, what's important to 'em, and how that'll play out when you're tryin' to make a deal.  When you're meetin' folks from a different background, you're gonna see things through your own lens, and that's natural. But don't let that cloud your judgment.\n\nTo understand 'em, you gotta dig deep. Learn about their history, their beliefs, their hang-ups. Don't go tryin' to change 'em, just accept 'em for who they are, especially if you're the underdog at the table. And remember, respect goes a long way.  If you show respect for their customs and beliefs, it'll make things a whole lot smoother.\n\nCulture ain't just about countries either.  Even inside a company, there's a whole vibe goin' on.  Some places are all about long hours, others are laid-back. You can tell a lot by how folks dress, how they talk, how they get things done, even how they give back to the community. Just look at how different companies are here in America, from coast to coast, city to suburbs. It's wild how diverse things can be, even in one place.\n\nValues are the real key, though. They're the heart of a culture, the \"why\" behind everything. If a culture values saving face or harmony, you ain't gonna see them embarrassin' their company or boss just to win a deal.  And a culture that's all about tough negotiations? They ain't gonna settle for the first thing that comes along.\n\nSo, before you even sit down at the table, do your homework. Figure out what makes 'em tick, what they value. But don't forget, a little personal touch goes a long way too. Get to know your opponent, show 'em you're more than just a business deal. That's how you make a real connection.",
            "Okay, so these two brainiacs, Anselm and Aquinas, both think there's a Big Guy upstairs, ya know? And they both wanna prove it, like a weird game of one-upmanship. But since I'm way more down-to-earth, lemme break it down for ya.\n\nAnselm, he's all about lookin' inside yourself, like, \"Dude, God's already in your head, so you gotta believe!\" Kinda like when you know your goldfish is hungry even before he starts tappin' on the glass. Anselm thinks faith is the key, no need for all that fancy proof stuff. \n\nThen there's Aquinas, the logic master. He's like, \"Nah, man, I got five solid reasons why God's gotta be real!\" He's talkin' 'bout change, cause and effect, stuff like that. Like, if you see a bunch of pieces of a puzzle, you just KNOW there's a missing one, right? Aquinas says it's the same with God - the universe makes sense 'cause there's gotta be a Big Guy behind it all.\n\nSo, who's got the better argument? Honestly, both of 'em make some pretty good points. But neither one's gonna convince me without a little more than just words, ya know? I need some solid evidence, not just head-scratchin' theories.",
            "Yo, so like, way back in the day, like, super long ago, there was this dude named Buddha, right? He was a prince, but he was all, 'Nah, this royal life ain't for me.' So, he ditched it all and became enlightened. His teachings, they became this big thing called Buddhism. There's a bunch of different types of Buddhism, but the most hardcore one is called Theravada. It's like, over 2,500 years old, and things have changed a bit since Buddha was chillin'.\n\nTake this festival they have in Sri Lanka, for example. They call it the water-cutting ceremony. Monks and regular folks participate, and it's kinda religious, but Buddha never talked about this kinda thing. It's just one example of how Buddhism has evolved over time. It's not just the goofy traditions, but even the deep, core beliefs have changed a little.\n\nWhy? Well, there are a bunch of reasons. Some stuff comes from inside the Buddhist community, like, changes made by monks and regular Buddhists. Other stuff comes from outside, like, people who aren't Buddhist. Sometimes these outside forces are cool, sometimes they're a total drag. \n\nLet's break down some key terms first, 'cause we're gonna use them a lot.  We got 'internal' and 'external' forces. Internal means stuff coming from Buddhists, whether they're monks or not. External means stuff from people outside Buddhism.  Then we have 'hostile' and 'benign'. Hostile forces mess with Buddhism, try to hurt it, or whatever. Benign forces don't really care about Buddhism, they just do their thing, which might accidentally help or hurt Buddhism.  \n\nAlright, now let's get down to the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in the 'Triple Gem': Buddha, the teachings (Dhamma), and the community (Sangha). The Dhamma is basically the holy scriptures, like the Tripitaka.  There's the Sutta Pitaka (Buddha's words), the Vinaya Pitaka (rules for monks), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (the deep, philosophical stuff). \n\nThey talk about things like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (suffering is real), and Anicca (everything's temporary).  You gotta get a handle on these ideas to break free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth.  When you do that, you also ditch all the bad stuff: lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). You become enlightened, like a boss.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. Regular folks have five precepts: don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't mess around sexually, and don't get wasted on drugs. Monks, they've got a whole lotta rules to follow. The most important idea in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths:\n\n1. Life is suffering (Dukkha).\n2. Suffering is caused by attachment.\n3. Suffering can be overcome.\n4. There's a path to overcome suffering (the Eightfold Path).",
            "So, get this: America and Mexico, they were like, totally at odds for, like, forever! I'm talking 57 years, from 1836 to 1893! It was a real thing, man, like a super intense rivalry. Remember that time America went and smashed Mexico in that war back in 1846? Yeah, that was a big deal. America took Texas and all that Southwest land for itself. Boom! Total power move.  \n\nBut it wasn't just about land, ya know? They also butted heads over religion, culture, the whole shebang. Like, imagine being all different and then having to live next door to each other. It's a recipe for disaster, right? \n\nIt's kinda like, you know, when your neighbor's dog keeps digging in your garden. You gotta be all \"Hey, chill out, dude!\" about it. Except instead of a dog, it's a whole country. \n\nAnyway, America and Mexico had their fair share of run-ins, like a whole bunch of them. They were like, \"Nope, not gonna share!\" over stuff like who should be in charge and what's considered cool.  And get this, an old dude named David M. Pletcher said that America's had way more drama with Mexico and Cuba than with any other country. Not cool, man.\n\nReligion was a major sticking point too. Back then, America was all \"We don't dig that Catholicism!\" and Mexico was like, \"Screw you, we're sticking with our faith!\" It's kind of like the whole Cold War thing, but instead of Communism, it was Catholic-phobia. It's like they thought if you didn't believe the same thing, you were the enemy.\n\nAnd guess what? It all stemmed from those old colonial times when England and Spain were at each other's throats.  They passed down all that bad blood to their kids, and America and Mexico just couldn't seem to get over it. \n\nThey fought over borders, stole each other's stuff, and pulled all sorts of shady stuff. It was a mess, man! But eventually, Mexico realized they needed America for stuff, and America wanted to control their economy instead of just taking their land. So, the rivalry fizzled out, but it took a long time.",
            "So, fifteen years back, BAM! I'm hit with this crazy illness out of nowhere. Never even heard of it before!  See, I was a nurse, figured it was the safe bet.  Everyone kept saying, \"You'll always have a job, people get sick all the time!\"  So I did it, even though my real dream was to be a scientist or maybe a journalist, or heck, both!  But here I was, 46, single, no cash in the bank, and totally outta commission.  Now, fifteen years and counting on disability, I've got nothin' left to call my own.  Scrapping by, that's the name of the game. Every day's a fight to keep my head above water, a constant battle for security, safety, and even just my self-respect.\n\nNothing's a sure thing anymore, but here's the deal: without my family and a few awesome friends, I wouldn't have made it this far. Believe me, when disaster hits, strong doesn't even begin to describe it. \n\nLife throws curveballs, big and small, all the time. No amount of planning can stop everything. Some stuff, you just can't handle alone.\n\nWe need to stop relying so much on the government, it's crumbling faster than a stale cookie. But I'd rather see folks helping each other out, building each other up, asking for help when they need it.  \n\nThose Conservatives keep talking about how \"rugged individualism\" built this country, but back in the day, what got folks through tough times wasn't being tough, it was kindness, respect, and sharing what you had. Those pioneers crossing the Rockies? They didn't make it without lookin' out for each other.\n\n\nSo yeah, be prepared. I am. Got my disaster kit, first aid, water purifiers, plastic sheeting for the windows, the whole shebang. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches... you name it, I got it.  If you've got the space and the means, a little farm and some canning supplies?  Go for it!  Wood stove, too, if you're not stuck in an apartment. \n\nBut here's the kicker: get to know your neighbors.",
            "Okay, so, like, why do critters evolve the way they do? Is there some kinda rulebook for evolution, ya know? Back in the day, this dude named D'Arcy Thompson said we're still figuring out how to talk about living things in numbers, and wouldn't ya know it, that's still kinda true. But, lately, folks have been using math to try and understand how shells grow, like, from baby to adult, and how that's changed over time. We're doing the same thing with these cool clams called Prunum. We're taking pictures of their shells, measuring all sorts of stuff, and then using computer programs to make up new shell shapes.  It's like, \"What if a shell did this instead of that?\" Kinda like when you play with LEGOs, but with science! We're also doing experiments to see how these different shapes actually work.\n\nThink of a shell like a spiral staircase that goes all the way around. Each step is a whorl, and they all spin around a central column called the columella. Sometimes the steps get bigger, sometimes they stay the same, and there's a line separating each step, called a suture. Usually, the biggest step is the last one, called the body whorl. The rest of the steps are called the spire, and the very tip is called the apex. And there's a hole at the bottom called the aperture where the clam sticks its head out. \n\nYou can look at a shell from different angles, like from the top, bottom, front, or back.\n\nCounting the whorls is kinda like slicing a cake. You look at the top, find the first line, and then count how many slices there are. We even look at how the opening of the shell changes as it grows. Imagine tracing the path of the opening as the clam builds its shell, that's like a map of its growth! We can even use math to make that map and see what would happen if the clam grew differently. Kinda neat, huh?",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya about Indonesia and their baby peeps.  For the last ten years, things haven't been changin' much when it comes to babies dyin' before they even turn one.  They're doin' alright with stuff like clean water and toilets, but when it comes to keepin' moms and babies healthy, they ain't quite makin' the cut.  \n\nTurns out, they're gettin' better at havin' babies with helpers around, but not all helpers are created equal.  Some are just midwives, and they can't handle tough situations, ya know?  Like when a mama starts bleedin' too much after givin' birth, those midwives are outta their league.  So even though they're makin' progress, it's kinda fake news.  Also, fewer kids are seein' doctors for tummy aches and stuff.  And postnatal care? Forget about it, that's a mess too.\n\nAnd here's the kicker:  cesarean sections are way too low, especially in the country parts.  In the city, they do 'em a decent amount, but in the sticks, not so much.  It's like the rich folks get all the good stuff.  \n\nThe poor folks are strugglin' to get care too, 'cause it costs too much.  \n\nSo what's the answer?  Should they focus on specific programs or fix the whole health system?   Programs are easier, they get results faster, but they can also mess things up.  Like, they might pour all their money into one thing, leaving other stuff to rot. Plus, ya get a bunch of programs doin' the same thing, but all disorganized.  Talk about a headache!",
            "Alright, so Victorian books are all about fancy details and rich folks, right? But then there's these two, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" that kinda break the mold. They're Victorian, but they're like, \"Nope, we're gonna throw in some mystery and weird stuff!\"  It makes the characters way more interesting because we get a peek into their heads and what makes them tick.\n\nLike, take this bit from \"Oliver Twist\":\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nSee, in these stories, things get kinda dreamlike and mysterious, especially with Oliver. It's like a window into his mind, showing us what's hurting him and how he sees the crazy stuff going on around him.\n\nWhen Oliver gets shot, it's like he's reliving it in a nightmare. He's overwhelmed, like he has no control, and everything feels numb. It's scary because it shows how broken he is and how much Fagin has messed with him. It makes you wonder who's really in charge of his fate.\n\n\nIn \"Wuthering Heights,\" it's different, but the mystery is still there. It's more about the darkness and hidden secrets of the characters.",
            "Okay, so picture this: a couple years back, I was helping out at this after-school program, you know, tutoring those little elementary schoolers. I was pretty good at English and reading, so that's what I mostly focused on.  Then this kid, Adrian, comes along. He was in like third or fourth grade, I think, and he was really struggling to read. It was weird, man. Some letters he'd nail, others? Not even close. It was like his brain was playing some kind of  letter-pronouncing game, and it hated him.  See, Adrian was Latino, and he spoke perfect English, which made it even weirder.  We were stuck in this reading rut until one day, Adrian's mom came in.  She didn't speak a lick of English, just Spanish.  My Spanish was like, \"hola\" and \"gracias\" level, but somehow we managed to chat.  BAM! It hit me like a ton of bricks. Adrian wasn't dumb, he just didn't know the English alphabet that well. It was like teaching someone to read using a completely different alphabet. I don't know if that helped him much in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now. \n\nAnyway, that's why I'm bringing this whole language barrier thing up. It's a big deal, especially here in California. It's not always as obvious as you think.  Even a kid who speaks English perfectly can still struggle with reading if they haven't got a good grasp of the alphabet. Everyone knows this is a problem, but what can we do about it? Adrian was kind of a simple case - some extra English reading help, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated.  There's no magic bullet.  Dual language programs, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of it works alone.  We need to mix and match! \n\nFirst off, dual language programs are awesome, not just for kids whose first language is Spanish, but for everyone. Studies show they actually do better in school!  People are scared about this, saying it wastes resources and benefits only a few.  But that's wrong. Think about it - if this was the norm, not the exception, everyone would benefit!\n\nSo how do we do it?  Do we make all teachers bilingual? Nah, that's crazy.  But I think we can have bilingual helpers, tutors, whatever you call them.",
            "From the time we're little munchkins, most folks are told there's somethin' bigger out there, somethin' way beyond our tiny brains. Some get sent to Sunday School, others to Temple, or maybe they just bug out on their own lookin' for answers.  A lotta us just go with whatever religion our parents gave us, but some wise guys, they say \"Nah, there ain't nothin' but this here brain and this here world.\"  We might even change our minds a bunch, findin' new ways to think about things. No matter what, we're all on this quest to figure out who we are, through our own messed up, unique views on what's holy and what ain't. We're all searchin' for a light in the darkness, somethin' to guide us outta the shadows and into the sunshine.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my old man said when I asked him what bird he liked best. We were sittin' on the porch, listenin' to the rain poundin' on the roof like a freakin' drum solo. Water was pourin' down the gutters, drownin' the plants by the steps.  He looked out at the rain, like he was half-searchin' for somethin', half-rememberin'. He'd gotten thinner, clothes hangin' off him like a bad Halloween costume.  His hair was gettin' thinner too, like a spooky, bald spot was comin' for him. He kept lookin' at the rain, wouldn't meet my eyes.  I felt lonely, scared, and couldn't bring myself to talk to him about how much I was gonna miss him.  Talkin' about it woulda made it real, and that was too much for both of us.  So I just hugged him, sat back down, scooted my chair closer, and joined him in watchin' the rain fall on that June night.\n\nMy dad kicked the bucket in December that year, five days after I turned twenty-two.  The chemo and radiation didn't make him feel any better, but it kept him around for a few months longer than the docs thought he'd last.  I couldn't say what good that did, though.  What kinda God does that?  Alone in the dark, I didn't pray.  If God was out there, I figured he stopped listenin' to me ages ago. \n\nI didn't wanna be there when he left this world for whatever came next.  So I wasn't.  Couldn't watch the man who made me fade away.  I wanted to remember him the way he lived, not the way he died. Besides, I knew my dad better than anyone else, better even than his own family.  I knew he wouldn't want me to be some sad spectator at his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waitin' for the news.\n\nNobody even called.",
            "So, get this, people have been yapping about Gothic novels forever. Some say they're a total snoozefest, others think they're the bee's knees, ya know, all \"terrible sublime\" and stuff. This dude Ian Watt, real smart guy, says they're basically a \"weird mix of old and new,\" which kinda makes sense when you think about it.\n\nThis whole thing started with this book, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" by this fella Horace Walpole. He took all these old school, like, super dramatic theatre ideas and mixed them up with the newfangled way of writing novels back then – you know, where you get up close and personal with the characters' minds.  He calls it a \"Gothic story,\" and BAM, the genre was born!\n\nGothic novels are like a throwback to the spooky, medieval vibes, with castles, knights, and all that jazz. But even back then, \"Gothic\" was kinda seen as old-fashioned and clunky compared to the \"modern\" stuff. \n\nBut here's the kicker – even though Gothic is, like, ancient history, it still sticks around because it's got this cool combo of drama and mystery. It's like, both out of date and totally fresh at the same time, which is kinda mind-blowing.\n\nOne big theme in Gothic novels is this thing called chivalry. It's all about knights being brave, honorable, and totally awesome. Gothic writers loved it because they thought modern society was lacking that whole chivalrous vibe.  They used chivalry to make the \"Gothic past\" look super idealized and romantic, kinda like a sneak peek at the future of the Romantic era. \n\nWalpole, the dude who started it all, was writing during some seriously messed up times politically. He was worried sick about the future, and maybe he thought the good ol' days of chivalry were gone for good. In his book, he shows this through his character Frederic, who's basically a perfect knight in shining armor. \n\nHe's a prince, he's been through some serious heartache, and he's supposed to be dead. It's like a dramatic, over-the-top version of a knight, which kinda sets the stage for the whole Gothic trope of going overboard.",
            "Alright, lemme break down this whole \"supply chain\" thing for ya. It's basically how stuff gets from the \"I want it!\" stage all the way to your doorstep. Think of it like a big, crazy race with lots of different players. \n\nThis guy named Keith Oliver, back in 1982, was the first to use the fancy term \"supply chain management.\" He figured out that to make things run smooth and get stuff to folks fast, ya gotta plan ahead, make it happen, and keep an eye on everything. \n\nThere are six main players in this supply chain game: making stuff, getting the stuff, keeping track of the stuff, deciding where stuff goes, moving stuff around, and sharing info about the stuff. Managers gotta juggle all these things to make sure customers are happy.\n\nFirst off, you gotta make the stuff!  That's the \"production\" part. It's like the first step in a big recipe, where you figure out what to make, how much to make, where to make it, and who's gonna do it. Managers gotta know what people want, so they check out the market – that's like lookin' at what's hot and trendy. \n\nOnce they know what folks want, they decide what to produce and how much. Then they gotta pick the best place to make it, making sure it's got everything it needs and can handle the workload. \n\nNext up is \"supply,\" which is all about finding the best people and places to help make your stuff. Maybe ya got different parts of the production process spread out, or maybe ya wanna outsource some stuff to other companies. That's where \"velocity\" comes in – doin' things fast and cheap while still keeping quality high.",
            "So, picture this, right?  Ellen Page, that chick from Juno, she's standing on a street corner, holding up this cardboard sign.  And get this, it says, \"Hitler is alive in Burma!\" Can you believe it?  Burma, which is also called Myanmar, is this weird country in Southeast Asia where these guys in charge, the military, they've been running things since 1962.  They're kinda like the bullies of the world, always making trouble and not letting anybody else have a say.  \n\nBack in 2007, a bunch of monks, like the peaceful kind, they decided to stand up to these guys.  It started with these little protests, like, \"Hey, we want a better life!\" But the military, they got all scared and started beating people up.  They even went into the monk's temples and trashed the whole place. It got so bad that journalists who were just trying to do their job got thrown in jail.  One guy, Kenji, he was just taking pictures, and they killed him!  \n\nThis isn't new, though.  Governments have always been like that, trying to boss people around and keep all the power for themselves.  Like, remember those Roman emperors way back when?  They thought they were gods!  And then there's Japan, where the emperor is supposed to be a god too!  And don't even get me started on our president, George W. Bush. He hangs out with this guy, Ted Haggard, who's like the leader of all the dumb people.  \n\nYou know, there have been other times when people have tried to stand up to these bad governments. Like in China, back in 1989, students and stuff, they protested, but the government just crushed them. It's messed up. And in Rwanda, in the 90s, they killed tons of people because of their religion or something.  And of course, there's Hitler, who killed millions of Jews.",
            "Duke Ellington, he was a real jazz legend, ya know?  He played piano, but he was even better at making music for his whole band. He knew how to write tunes that let each player shine, even if it was just a little solo. He was like a conductor, but he also knew how to make the whole orchestra sound like one big, crazy good instrument. \n\nHeck, he even used voices like instruments in some of his stuff. Like this song \"Creole Love Call\".  It's a slow blues song, and the singer, he's not singing words, he's just making sounds, like an instrument!  It's kinda cool.\n\nThis guy, he knew how to make each player sound their best, and he knew how to make them all sound good together. He wrote some of the coolest, most amazing jazz music ever!  He even used a trumpet guy named Bubber Miley and a singer named Baby Cox to do this thing where they were callin' and respondin' to each other. It was like they were making music with their voices and their horns at the same time.\n\nThen there's this other song, \"It Don't Mean a Thing\".  Ellington had this trombone player, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton. He was a regular in Ellington's band, and in this song, he plays the first note of the song on his trombone, and it's like, BAM! You know that's Ellington right away!",

It started when she was 14, hittin' that awkward teenage phase, and it was still there at 17.  Now, she knew it wasn't somethin' she could just buy, it was somethin' more... someone. But nobody, not a single dude, had ever caught her eye.  Some had tried, bless their hearts, makin' all those goofy moves, but nothin' clicked. She wracked her brain, tryin' to figure out what was up with her. Theories bounced around, but nothin' stuck. So, she just kept livin', always wonderin' what this itch was all about.\n\nHome life was usually pretty chill. Her folks were cool cats, never fightin' and rarely even gettin' into it with her.  Arguments were mostly about her tryin' to spread her wings and show 'em who she was.  They were a calm bunch, but she brought the energy, the fun, the whole shebang. That, plus her sweet personality, made her a real hit wherever she went.\n\n\nBut today wasn't a chill day.  She was wanderin' around, lookin' for somethin' to spark her creativity, when she heard a yelp from the kitchen. It was her mom, and her voice sounded scared. She bolted in there, heart poundin', shoutin', \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?!\" There she was, sprawled out on the floor, whimperin' in pain. \"Ow... swe - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" she managed between breaths.  \n\nHer daughter sprang into action, her mom's words urgent and scared. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where to get ya,\" she said, already thinkin' about how she'd get her to the car.  Her mom pointed weakly, and her daughter, thankful for those self-defense classes, scooped her up and carried her to the car. \n\n\nThe hospital was a whirlwind of smells - antiseptic, sickness, and a whole lotta fear. But her daughter was focused on one thing: her mom. She rushed her in, hollerin' for help.

            "Alright, so picture this: there's this super healthy way of eating called the \"Mediterranean Diet,\" but lemme tell ya, it's a bit much for some folks. So, they came up with a simpler version called the 'alternate Mediterranean diet,' (or aMed for short). Basically, it's all about munching on plants like fruits, veggies, nuts, and beans, while keeping the meat and fatty stuff to a minimum. It's like, \"Hey, let's load up on good stuff and ditch the bad!\" \n\nEveryone knows that eating healthy is good for ya, right? Well, some earlier studies showed that folks who followed the Mediterranean Diet had less heart trouble and lived longer. This new study wanted to see if the aMed diet had the same effect, especially when it came to strokes. They followed a bunch of nurses for 20 years, asking 'em about what they ate every few years. And guess what? The nurses who ate the most like their Mediterranean diet buddies had a lower chance of getting heart disease and strokes!  They kept track of everything, like smoking, exercise, and even how many vitamins they popped. It's all about being super careful, ya know?\n\nSo, the study found that the more plants you eat and the less junk you stuff your face with, the less likely you are to have a heart attack or stroke.  Pretty simple, right?",
            "Back in 2007, things got REAL hairy in America. People were losing jobs faster than you can say \"sub-prime mortgage,\" and houses were going for less than a used pizza cutter.  The big money guys, the ones with names like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, they were singing the blues. See, they'd been handing out loans like candy to folks who couldn't really afford 'em –  like giving a goldfish a credit card!  And then, BAM! Those loans went south faster than a fry cook on vacation.  \n\nIt all started way back in the Clinton days, when everyone was feelin' good and the economy was hummin'. The Prez wanted another term, so they loosened up the rules on loans, thinking it'd make everyone happy. But, it was like lettin' loose a pack of rabid squirrels in a china shop.  \n\nSome smart guy over at the New York Times, Steven Holmes, saw what was comin' a mile away. He's like, \"Yo, this is gonna blow up!\" But nobody listened.  \n\nThen came those fancy new mortgage things, like adjustable-rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. They sound complicated, right? That's 'cause they are!  It was like weaving a giant, tangled mess of financial threads, and when one thread snapped, the whole thing started unravelin'.\n\nAnd unravel it did. The housing bubble popped, and all those fancy investment banks were left holdin' the bag. They were in deep doo-doo, like a raccoon in a garbage can. Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers?  Gone. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? Government bailouts, baby!  \n\nSo, there you have it. A bunch of bad decisions, a whole lotta greed, and a dash of economic ignorance led to a real mess.",

It's like showing off your best moves, painting a picture with words, making your readers go \"Wow!\"  Except, sometimes, you end up droning on and on, like a broken record.  That's exposition, and it's the writer's kryptonite.\n\nSee, we've all heard \"Show, don't tell,\" but sometimes even the best writers get tripped up.  They get caught up in explaining *everything*, turning their story into a boring history lesson.  It's like that friend who always has to tell you *every single detail* about their day, even the boring parts.\n\nExposition is like that friend, except it's your story, and you're the one making everyone yawn.  In movies, it's when a character starts dumping information on another, like they're reading a Wikipedia article aloud.

You want to *feel* the love they shared, see it in their actions and words, understand why his death is so devastating.  You want to see the heroine's grief, her strength, her vulnerability.  \n\nIt's all about adding depth, making the story come alive.  Instead of just telling us about the husband, let us *experience* him.  Show us his personality, his humor, his flaws.\n\nDon't just tell us the characters met, got married, and he died.

They had this story about this dude in Ashley, Ohio, who stabbed his wife, but, like, they didn't even say her name. The creep's name was Shad Hostettler. Man, his mugshot was straight-up scary!  They only talked about it for a couple of minutes, said he stabbed her a bunch of times and got caught, but that was it.\n\nThen they had this thing about this Travis Buyers, 18 years old, got shot in Sharon Woods and was in real bad shape. No arrests, no suspects, just the SWAT Team sniffing around. Seemed kinda short, maybe 'cause it wasn't some white kid or something. It's like, if a white person gets messed with the news freaks out, but if it's a minority, they barely mention it. \n\nNext, they showed this hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, a .22 bullet, some dude shot it! They were offering five grand for info on the shooter. Then, boom, talk about the weather, rain and thunderstorms coming Saturday, just a quickie though, gotta keep you watching, ya know? \n\nThey also had this story about a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. Some dude, black, wearing a hoodie, six-foot, about 150 pounds. They kept saying he was black and how dark his skin was, kinda weird, yeah?\n\nFinally, they talked about this Rene Rodriguez, a drug lord from Texas, doing time for selling weed to Ohio.

You gotta deal with the consequences, ya know? 'Cause when you look your brother straight in the eye and see yourself lookin' back, you see the real you, not how people think you are. It's in your actions, what you do, that shows what you're really made of.\n\nThis story, \"The Scarlet Ibis\",  it's all about that brother stuff.  These two guys, they got this intense connection, but it's messed up, kinda.  They're in this place, all beautiful and green, and they're on this crazy trip that ain't gonna end well.  There's this big fight, pride and disappointment clashing, and only one of 'em makes it out alive.\n\nThe story uses these brothers, Doodle and the narrator, to show how messed up this whole thing can get. The narrator, he's all about pride, from the start. He wants a brother who can keep up with him, someone who can do all the cool stuff he wants to do. Doodle, though, he's different. He's weak, can barely walk, and he's doomed from the start. The narrator's dreams, they get crushed.  He even thinks about killing Doodle, can you believe that? But then Doodle smiles at him, and... well, that changes things. It shows that deep down, he loves his brother, even if he's a pain in the neck sometimes.",
            "Yo, check it! This brain thing is wild, right? Back in the day, folks thought it was like a wax tablet, then papyrus, then a book, and now they're sayin' it's like a computer. But hold up! Don't get too caught up in these comparisons, 'cause they don't tell the whole story. \n\nSee, this brain of yours, it's like a total info-processing machine. It grabs stuff from your senses – touch, sound, sight – and turns it into electrical signals. Then it's like a crazy remix, all these signals bouncing around, getting analyzed from different angles. It's called bottom-up and top-down processing. Imagine you see a black box on a white background. Bottom-up is like figuring out the basics: \"Hey, there's a shape, it's black, it's on a white thing.\" Top-down is like using your brainpower to go, \"Aha! It's a box!\"\n\nBut here's the kicker: your brain's got this filter, like a bouncer at a club, deciding what's important and what gets tossed aside. You see tons of grass when you look down, but your brain's like, \"Nah, not worth remembering.\" But if someone shouts your name in a crowd, bam! It's front and center. So it's all about prioritizing, yo!\n\nAnd speaking of remembering, your brain's got different storage compartments: sensory, working, and long-term. It's like filing cabinets, each with its own purpose. Sensory memory is fleeting, like a passing thought. Working memory holds stuff for a short while, like remembering a phone number. Long-term memory is the big vault, where all your experiences and knowledge chill. \n\nBut how's all this knowledge organized? That's a big mystery. Some say it's like a network, with ideas connected like branches on a tree. Others think it's more like a giant puzzle, with pieces fitting together in complex ways. \n\nIt's a wild ride, this brain thing, but it's what makes us, well, us.",
            "Yo, check it! This book, \"Brave New World,\" by Huxley, is totally dissing technology and the whole capitalist system. It's set up like a messed-up future where everyone's all about being part of the group and chasing instant happiness. They're basically puppets, man, dancing to the tune of the World Controller. This dude's got all the power, and he's running the show.\n\nThis book's got some deep stuff going on, like this Marxist thing. You know, it talks about how society's rigged, how everyone's the same, man, and how the rich guys are totally screwing over the poor folks. It's like Huxley saw the future and was like, \"Whoa, this is messed up!\"\n\nHe's using this thing called \"false consciousness,\" which basically means the people are so busy chasing stuff they don't even realize they're being manipulated. They're all about buying stuff and getting their kicks, but they don't see the big picture. It's like they're brainwashed! The World Controller's like the ultimate puppet master, controlling everything from the get-go.\n\nAnd it's not just about money, man. It's about power. The rich guys are on top, and they keep the poor guys down. It's a total power trip.\n\nBut here's the kicker: the people in this book, they don't even care! They're so used to being controlled that they don't even question it. They're like, \"Yeah, this is how it's supposed to be.\" It's freakin' scary, man.\n\nThey don't have real relationships or feelings. They're all just shallow and superficial. It's like Huxley's saying that technology and capitalism are killing our humanity. We're becoming robots, man, just like the ones in that crazy future!",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this campus, man. I've been here for like, two and a half years, which is, like, four and a half semesters in their weird college speak. Getting around this place is a total drag, lemme tell ya. My first year I was stuck in these East Halls dorms, way out on the edge of campus, like, you could practically see the stadium from there.  Getting to class, especially to those places like Willard, which is like, in the middle of everything, was a freakin' marathon, especially when the weather decided to act up, which, let's be real, is, like, all the time here in State College. \n\nSo, I was chatting with this old grad, not much older than me, and he told me that back in the day, East Halls was like, totally isolated. There was, like, this massive wasteland between it and the rest of the campus. Now, it's all filled up with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. It's like they just keep expanding this place, making it even harder to get from point A to point B.\n\nWhat's the answer to this mobility mess? Bikes, man!  Bikes are the way to go. But it's not just about having the bike; the campus needs to be built for bikers. This friend of mine, he got back into biking after, like, a long break, and he was all, \"Dude, why did I ever stop?\" He was like, \"Bikes are the only way to get around.\" \n\nBesides being good for your bod, bikes are the most efficient way to travel.  A bowl of oatmeal and some pedaling and you're good for, like, 30 miles.\n\nNow, I live off campus, just as far out as some dorms.  The smartest move I made this year? Buying a bike. My classes are in Thomas building, which is, like, a 25-minute walk from my place. On a bike? Five minutes, tops, if I push it.  The only problem? Pollock Road, the quickest way to Thomas, is, like, a pain in the butt, whether you're on a bike or walking. \n\nWalking's cool too, but I'm too busy for that. Without my bike, walking would be my only option, and that's, like, a whole other story. Walking to Thomas every day would add, like, 30-40 minutes to my day. That's, like, two and a half hours a week! And that's just Thomas. Add everything else, all the other classes, appointments, and stuff, and that's way too much time wasted."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.

            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",

Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "SA2B here!  So, I'm thinkin' about becoming a social worker, y'know, helpin' out the little guys who got it rough. Kids who've been through the wringer, families messin' up, that kinda thing.  I figure, I can offer a few things to the social work game. First off, I'm all about helpin' people, always have been. Secondly, I treat everyone with respect, no matter what. And, I'm a straight-shooter, always doin' the right thing. I wanna make things better for folks, not just in their lives, but for myself too. Gotta keep learnin' and growin' to be the best I can be.\n\nSee, I always wanted to do somethin' to make a difference, but wasn't sure how.  Went through high school and college, saw a lot of folks runnin' from their problems, makin' bad choices.  That's why I got my psychology degree, figured it would give me some tools to help.\n\nThen one day, this friend of mine had this kid, just sixteen, all nervous, stayin' on her couch. Turns out, he was runnin' from some messed-up parents. Next day, heard he'd called the cops. Figured I'd lend a hand, so I went over to his folks' place. Talked to the cops, told 'em about my degree and my concerns. They wanted me to talk to the parents, said there wasn't much they could do.\n\nWell, when I talked to the parents, they were all jumpy, makin' excuses for how their son was just \"manipulative\" for gettin' the cops involved. It was a \"simple\" family fight, they said.  That's when it hit me, that's what I wanna do, help these kids who are stuck in these messed-up situations. \n\nSocial work ain't just about helpin' kids, though. It's about standin' up for what's right, fightin' for those who can't fight for themselves. You know, like when folks say everyone's an individual, but then they wanna make everyone fit in the same mold? That ain't right. I'm unique, and I wanna see everyone else be unique too.\n\nBack in high school and college, I did my part. Dyed my hair crazy colors, wore what I wanted, pierced my ears, joined the GSBA, spoke up against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it.  That's what social justice is all about, standin' up for what's right, even when it's hard. And I'm gonna keep doin' it.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this thing called insomnia, see? Some folks think it's all in your genes or your body, kinda like a bug in the system. They call that the \"biological\" model. Others say it's more about where you're from, who your folks are, and the whole shebang of life's craziness. That's the \"sociocultural\" model.\n\nSo, to figure this thing out, we gotta look at both sides. Like, some folks have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep (that's insomnia, plain and simple). Others sleep way too much, or fall asleep at random times (that's the hypersomnia crew). Then there's folks who have crazy dreams, sleepwalk, or even talk in their sleep. It's a real mixed bag!\n\nNow, the \"biological\" folks say it's all about these tiny things in your brain called neurons. They fire and they don't fire, and that's what makes you sleep or wake up.  This one study used mice, see, and they found these special neurons that control sleep. When these neurons get messed up, bam! You've got trouble sleeping. \n\nThe \"sociocultural\" folks say it's more about your environment. Where you live, who you hang out with, even your job can affect your sleep. It's like this big web of stuff that all works together.",
            "Hey there! So, let's talk about this thing called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short.  It's kinda like, your brain has trouble understanding what your ears are hearing, even if you can hear just fine. Imagine trying to sort out a bunch of noisy voices in a crowded room – that's what it's like for folks with CAPD. \n\nThis wasn't always called CAPD, though. Back in the 50s, they called it \"auditory imperception.\"  A bunch of smart folks started figuring out how it works, like these researchers in Italy and a guy named Kimura. They came up with tests to see if a kid's brain was processing sounds the way it should.  \n\nCAPD can show up in all sorts of ways.  Maybe someone has trouble hearing sounds from different directions, or they can't tell the difference between similar sounds, like \"cat\" and \"hat.\" They might also have a hard time understanding speech when there's a lot of background noise, or they might not pick up on changes in tone, like when someone's being sarcastic.  It's like their brain is missing some of the clues!\n\nSo, how do you know if someone has CAPD? Well, there are these special tests that audiologists and speech therapists give. They might ask you to listen to different sounds and tell them what you hear, or they might watch how you respond to different kinds of auditory information.  There's no one magic test, though, and we don't know exactly what causes CAPD.",
            "So, this play, Twelfth Night, it's kinda saying that while pretending to be someone else can work for a while, like, REALLY work, you gotta ditch the fake eventually or you'll lose yourself, ya know?  The problem is, dropping the act can mess things up with your peeps. Some folks won't care, but others, they'll be ticked off about the whole charade.  It's like, do you keep up the lie to protect yourself, or do you risk hurting the people you care about? Tough choice, right?\n\nThis whole disguise thing gets even weirder when it comes to switching genders, like Viola did. Why'd she do it? Safety, I guess.  She's new in town, and playing a dude seems safer than being all vulnerable as a girl. It worked, but now she's cut off from other women, which is a bummer.  And get this, she's so convincing as a dude that Olivia, this chick, falls head over heels for her! Talk about awkward. Then there's Orsino, who's totally smitten with Viola but thinks she's a dude. It's a whole mess of feelings!\n\nTwelfth Night makes you think, though. Maybe all this pretending helps people figure out what they REALLY feel. Like, is Olivia into guys or gals? Or maybe  Orsino's just confused about his own feelings? Viola's disguise kinda forces them to deal with stuff they've been ignoring.\n\nBut here's the kicker: Olivia's kinda quick to move on from Viola/Cesario to Sebastian, her twin bro. She seems more interested in looks than anything else.  Maybe she's just playing the game, ya know, like everyone else in this crazy play.",
            "Alright, so lemme tell ya about this German place they called a \"colony,\" right?  It was a real mess, especially in this place called South West Africa, now Namibia.  They were real meanies to the locals, like the Ovaherero and Nama folks,  kinda like a really bad bully. But hey, not all Germans were bad, ya know? Some were actually kinda cool.  Like in East Africa, they built schools and stuff for the local folks.  But in South West Africa, it was like, \"nah, we ain't doin' that.\" They left it all up to these church groups, and they didn't give 'em much dough.  They did spend a ton of money on schools for the white folks though. Weird, right?  \n\nAnyway, this messed up the whole place, even after the Germans were gone.  East Africa had lots of smart folks, but in South West Africa, most people couldn't read or write.   There are these books about this stuff, written way back when, mostly in German.  They just kinda describe what was goin' on.  Later, some folks wrote more books in English, comparing all the different colonies. They figured out that South West Africa was different 'cause there were a lot more white folks livin' there.   One guy, Cohen, wrote a whole thing about this, sayin' it all comes down to how many white folks were there.   It was mostly hot and dry, but still, a bunch of white folks settled there. By 1913, there were almost 15,000 of them, way more than in any other colony.",
            "Man, music's gotten wild over the last hundred years, right? Like, there are so many different types now it's hard to keep track. You got your rap, your rock, your country, your jazz, your folk...  Heck, even those have tons of little branches and branches of branches!  But seriously, heavy metal rocks, dude! It's been around for about forty years and it's gone from just one sound to, like, a whole universe of sounds. It's all about feeling something deep, you know? It's like the music gets right in your soul, even if it's the dark side of your soul.\n\nAnd the crazy part? People have been messing with metal since day one,  always trying to make it weirder and wilder. It's like a chain reaction, man!  One band does something new, and then a bunch of other bands are like, \"Whoa, that's cool, let's take it even further!\" And that's how we got all these crazy sub-genres, and sub-sub-genres, and who knows what else.  \n\nNow, it's so hard to say what metal *is* anymore. It's like a melting pot of everything. But it all started somewhere, right? To get the whole picture, we gotta look back at what metal is really about.\n\nIt's more than just a bunch of loud music. It's a whole movement, a whole attitude. It's like a scream into the darkness. You got the heavy bass, the crushing volume, the wild energy, the crazy shows... It's like metal bands are saying, \"We're not messing around, we're here to make you FEEL something!\" And they're not afraid to get intense, man. They really know their instruments, and they're not afraid to show off.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the drugs, dude. Back in the 70s, everyone was tripping out on all sorts of stuff, and it totally influenced the music.  Metal became a way to express that wild, chaotic energy.  It was like, \"Hey, we're not afraid of the dark side, we embrace it!\"\n\nAnd you know what? It's still going strong today. Metal bands are still pushing boundaries, still exploring the darkest corners of the human experience. It's a pretty amazing thing, when you think about it.",
            "Okay, so check this out. This dude, Henri Rousseau, painted like crazy back in the day, way before all those other weirdos were painting their weird dreams.  He's like, a Post-Impressionist, you know, one of those guys who did his own thing.  He had this painting, *The Dream*,  it's from 1910, and it's about this girl totally blown away by this crazy dreamland. But get this, it's also about Rousseau's own dreams, like, what he wanted to be and all that jazz. \n\nSee, this dude dreamed of being a big shot artist, like, everyone loving his stuff and all that. But here's the catch:  he had this major inner struggle.  Should he paint like everyone else to get famous, or should he just do his own thing and be unique? *The Dream* is like his whole life story, y'know?\n\nRousseau, this guy, he was born way back in 1844, in France. His dad was a business kinda guy, and Rousseau, he didn't go to art school or nothin'. He was working for the government, like collecting tolls or somethin'. He even had this nickname, \"douanier,\" which is like a customs inspector.  Life wasn't easy for him. He lost his first wife and a bunch of kids.  So, he decided to paint, to make himself feel better, I guess. \n\nHe really wanted to be accepted by the art world, which is understandable, right?  He wasn't a fancy art school guy, he started painting later in life, and there were tons of other crazy talented artists around.  He even started getting noticed around the same time as Matisse, who was already a superstar. This guy Gordon wrote a book about French painters, and he says that Matisse was all about avoiding boring art, while Rousseau just wanted to paint something so \"normal\" that people would finally like him.",
            "So, get this, right? A bunch of brainy folks have been saying that ethics and art, truth and beauty, are like, totally connected. And you know what? I kinda agree. Like, Keats, that poet dude, he said, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"  We learn stuff through school and stuff, but  ethics and art, they just kinda...click with us, ya know? It's not like we're taught to appreciate a good painting or a good deed, it just happens. \n\nThink about it. We try to explain why something's art or why something's right, but can we really?  Like, we can talk about the Mona Lisa's colors and stuff, but that doesn't explain why it's so darn cool.  It's like when someone asks about your favorite book or song, you just kinda go, \"There's just something about it...\"  Art and morals, they're more than just rules or explanations, ya know? They're kinda like...transcendent, like there's this extra something special they got.  \n\nFlannery O'Connor, she said stories are like, the only way to say some things, 'cause words just can't do it justice. Same with art and morals, there's this thing they got that goes beyond what you can put into words.\n\nSee, it's like we feel art and morals deep down, in this way that's hard to explain.  It's like, beyond our normal thinking, ya know? And literature, man, it's extra special 'cause it deals with values, with what's important in life. It's like life itself, full of stuff we gotta figure out.\n\nSo, yeah, I think art and morals are super connected 'cause they both hit us in this deep, meaningful way that words can't always capture.",
            "Hey, check this out! Germany today is a total powerhouse, a country with its own awesome vibe, from the mountains near Munich to the Baltic Sea in Kiel. It's like one big party, all the way from Cologne on the Rhine River to Dresden by the Elbe. With a culture so unique, it makes sense that Germany, as we know it, came from all sorts of different groups and tribes. \n\nThe place where it all started is called Germania, the homeland of the Germans. Where the name came from, though, is a mystery! Some say it's from a tribe called the Tungrians, who were like, \"Yo, we're the Germans now!\" before they crossed the Rhine and messed with the Gauls (according to Tacitus, a guy who wrote stuff a long time ago).  Julius Caesar, the guy who fought the Gauls and wrote about it, was the first to use the word \"Germanus\" to talk about these tough guys. He used it to tell the difference between the Gauls he beat and the Germans he hadn't conquered yet. Some think it came from a word the Gauls used for \"neighbor,\" but who knows for sure? Caesar said in his book about the Gallic Wars that the Germans were always fighting the Gauls, like it was their daily routine (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others think it comes from the spear the Germans used, called a \"ger,\" or maybe from an old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" because Germans are loud, you know?\n\nThis Roman dude named Tacitus, who wrote stuff way back in AD 98, said the Germans were pure and hadn't mixed with other people, like they just appeared out of nowhere. He's like, \"Why would anyone leave Asia or Africa for a place like Germany? It's wild, the weather is bad, and the people are grumpy!\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nThe Romans didn't really want to live in Germania, but they did send folks there to get stuff and fight sometimes. They mostly stayed in their own big empire. Meanwhile, the Germans hung out on the edge of Rome's territory, trading their stuff and even joining the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "So there I was, staring down at this thing, my brain just kind of...spinning. I wasn't really *feeling* anything, just kinda watching it like a scientist, you know?  Thoughts were popping up and disappearing faster than I could catch them. It was like my brain was on autopilot, just soaking up the sight in front of me.\n\nRemember that art book I got, the one about drawing with your \"right brain\"?  \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" or something like that.  It taught you how to actually *see* things, like breaking down a whole scene, a kitchen with a fruit bowl and everything, into just that bowl of fruit.  That's what I was trying to do here, but my brain was overloaded.\n\nI mean, Picasso had his blue period, Monet loved painting his gardens, and all those Renaissance guys were all about the colors. I was thinking, maybe this is my thing, my \"Work in Brown.\"  My masterpiece.\n\nI grabbed my weapon of choice - a mop - and got ready to create. My hand was steady, my mind focused. I could almost feel the artistic energy flowing through me.  The water swirled, so smooth and clear...then I whacked the toilet handle, and that's when it hit me.  This wasn't a masterpiece, it was a pile of brown mush someone left as a message for the poor schmuck who had to clean it. \n\nI flushed again, took a deep breath, and tried to focus.  I wrapped the toilet paper around my hand like a glove, ready to face the brown beast.  Why did people do this to others? It was like they were saying, \"Hey, enjoy your day! Here's a little gift!\"  A gift of poop.",
            "Yo, check it! Teenagers are gettin' themselves killed behind the wheel, man. It's a real bummer.  \n\nSee, the thing is, their brains ain't fully cooked yet for all the craziness of driving. And, let's face it, they're newbies at this whole driving thing.  They crash more, spin out, speed like maniacs, and even go off the road more often.\n\nAnd guess what? They're more likely to crash when they're cruisin' with their buddies – which, you know, is like, totally normal for teens. Some smart folks in California did a study and found the younger the passenger, the more likely they were to get into a fender bender.\n\nSo, states like California have tried to make things safer by giving teenagers these temporary licenses that limit their driving hours and who they can have in the car.  \n\nBut, let's be real, those temporary licenses are just a bandaid on a bullet hole. The real problem is that young drivers, as a group, just aren't ready for the responsibility, man. One psychologist dude, Marvin Zuckerman, even thinks 18 is too young to get a full license. He says young people, especially those under 20, just crave that adrenaline rush, you know? They love to push the limits.\n\nSo, maybe we should wait until that thrill-seeking fades a bit before handing them the keys. If we keep giving licenses to young teens, we're gonna see even more accidents, and the death toll is gonna be outta control.  \n\nThink about it – in a few years, all those baby boomers' kids are gonna be old enough to drive, and it's gonna be a whole mess.\n\nWe need to get serious about this. Schools can still teach them about driving, but no one under 18 should be behind the wheel.  We can still have those temporary licenses and make them log some practice hours with a grown-up.\n\nWe need to make this a national thing, man. It's not like anyone's coming up with a new idea here. Just gotta make it happen.",
            "So, I was  checking out some old Edison flicks at the Library of Congress, you know, the ones from way back in the day, like the 1890s and early 1900s.  There were a bunch of these  \"trick films\" -  they were all about pullin' the wool over your eyes with crazy editing. I spent a good while figuring out how they did their magic, how they made things appear and disappear, and what made some of those later films stand out from the crowd. \n\nMost of these early trick films were like little stages, all set up in front of a camera.  They never moved the camera around, just kept it fixed like you'd see in a play.  They stuck to long shots and the occasional medium shot, never getting up close and personal like we do today.  And get this - each trick was usually just one long shot, kinda like a continuous performance.\n\nThey really leaned into that stage vibe, just like vaudeville or magic shows.  The actors would walk side-to-side, never coming forward or backward towards the camera. It was like they were stuck in a box, ya know?  Take \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" for example, everyone just shuffled back and forth.\n\nAnd because they didn't move close to the camera, they never used close-ups.  It was all about seeing the whole picture at once, just like in a live performance.\n\nBecause each trick was basically one long shot, the whole film was usually super short, maybe a minute or less.  Most of them were just a quick series of tricks, like magic, disappearing acts, or switching stuff around. It wasn't really about telling a story, more like a bunch of mini-acts strung together.  Oh, but here's the sneaky part - what looks like one shot to you might actually be a bunch of shots glued together to make the illusion work. Check out \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" - it looks like one long shot, but if you look closer, you'll see where they secretly switched out Mary's head!",
            "Alright, listen up! This guy John Taylor, real stickler for freedom, especially when it came to farming.  He was all about folks doing their own thing, no government meddling.  He thought farming was the best gig ever, and that's what shaped his whole take on how things should run.  He wanted a government that said \"Hey, you do your thing, we'll do ours, and let's keep it that way.\"\n\nHe thought America had a clean slate, no old traditions getting in the way. That meant they could build a government that worked for everyone, based on the idea that everyone's got basic rights that no one can mess with.  He was big on those \"natural rights\" – like, if one gets squashed, they all get squashed, ya know?  No way the government should be messing with those.  \n\nJohn thought the government should be like this cautious guardian, keeping the good stuff from getting messed up and stopping the bad stuff from going too far.  He believed folks are good at heart, but also kinda sneaky, always looking out for number one.  That's why he wanted a government that protected your stuff, helped farmers out, and kept things fair.\n\nHe was all about sticking to the Constitution, too. No fancy interpretations, just plain words.  He thought the government should be small and leave folks alone, but not so small that it couldn't keep things in line. He even thought the Declaration of Independence was more important 'cause it showed the states were in charge, not some big ol' national government.",
            "Okay, so check it out. We had this whole tracker for people who were ditching their cars and trying out other ways to get around campus, right? Well, things were totally rad at first, but then BAM!  Around month three, the number of folks logging their trips dropped like a rock. Kinda bummed us out, to be honest.\n\nSee, winter hit our college town, and everyone's less likely to bike or walk when it's freezing. Plus, December is crazy busy with schoolwork and holiday stuff. Who can be bothered with logging their commute when they're stressed out? And then, boom, holidays hit, and everyone's gone!\n\nEven after things calmed down in January, the log submissions didn't really pick up.  I guess sometimes projects just lose steam after the initial hype.  \n\nSo, we decided to throw a \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March.  We gave out prizes like gift certificates to local shops and restaurants – you know, the usual stuff. It kinda worked, but it was kinda like trying to keep a goldfish swimming upstream.  We learned that keeping people engaged is a real challenge, especially with holidays and school breaks messing with the flow.\n\nAnother thing we learned is that people love their cars! It's like a cultural thing. So, we gotta come up with some seriously awesome incentives to get folks ditching their rides. You know, like a sweet new bike, a hybrid car, or even a killer electric car! Maybe that would have kept things exciting. \n\nHonestly, the prizes we had were cool at first, but maybe we should have upped the ante as the project went on. Imagine if we had announced a couple of bikes in December, then a whole hybrid car in January… I bet people would have been all over it!",
            "Yo, lemme break down this ETF thing for ya.  It's like a basket of investments, kinda like a mutual fund, but you can buy and sell it on the stock market like a regular stock.  You get the good stuff from both worlds:  diversification like a fund, but you can play the game like a stockbroker, ya know?   Short selling, margin buying, all that jazz. Plus, ETFs usually cost way less than mutual funds.   \n\nBut hold up, there's a catch. You gotta pay a fee every time you buy or sell, just like with stocks. And don't get me wrong, there are tons of different ETFs out there, so you gotta do your homework and figure out which one's right for you.  \n\nNow, let's talk about this IHF ETF. I'm gonna look at its top ten holdings, which make up a big chunk of the whole thing.  My buddy Gage's dad got a hold of this thing called \"HULK\" on DVD, but I already saw it in the theater.  Anyway, I wanna see if owning just these top ten stocks is better than owning the whole ETF.\n\nLet's see if these stocks really hold up their end of the bargain.  I'm gonna compare their returns and risk (that's the \"Beta\" stuff) to the whole ETF.  \n\nTurns out, owning just those top ten stocks could give you a bigger return and less risk!  But hey, maybe I'm wrong.  We gotta do some fancy math to make sure those differences are real, ya know?\n\nSo, I'm gonna check the \"standard deviation\" of each of those stocks to see how they shake out compared to the whole ETF.  That'll tell me if owning those ten stocks is really a better deal than the whole shebang.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya about this poem, \"Dream-Land,\" by Edgar Allan Poe. It's one of his favorites, ya know? He uses this word \"Thulé,\" twice in the poem, and it's a big deal. This word goes way back to Virgil, an old-school dude who wrote about an island way up north, where everyone thought the world ended. Virgil used it, for sure, but Poe was a big fan of German writers, especially this guy Goethe. Now, this Goethe dude wrote this epic poem called \"Faust,\" and it's super famous.  One part of \"Faust\" has a poem called \"The King of Thulé,\" and it's about this king who loses his wife and goes totally bonkers, drinking himself to death.\n\nSome folks say Poe was basically copying Goethe's style, especially since they both talk about this gloomy place called Thulé.  Poe even uses it twice in his \"Dream-Land,\" like bookends, ya know?  \n\nPoe's \"Dream-Land\" is all about this dark, lonely place, with dead friends haunting him, and everything's gray and lifeless. Kinda like the king in Goethe's poem, he's lost his wife and his will to live. It's like Poe stepped right into Goethe's poem. \n\nPoe loved German stuff, and he was a big fan of Tennyson, who was also into Goethe. So, Poe probably knew about Goethe's work even if he didn't directly copy him.",
            "So, picture this: there's this chick, Jennifer, right? She goes to D&D grocery store, steps on some applesauce, BAM! Takes a spill and hurts her back real bad. Now, she's sayin' the store manager, Martin, shoulda known better 'cause folks had been slipping on spills before. See, two employees told him about the applesauce mess, but he was busy eatin' dinner and said \"Nah, not my problem.\" Half an hour later, BAM! Jennifer goes down.\n\nNow, Jennifer's lawyer's sayin' Martin acted real shady. They're talkin' 'bout \"punitive damages,\" which means extra money to punish the store for bein' jerks. \n\nThey're sayin' Martin knew folks were slipping and didn't care.  They say he acted like a total jerk, like he wanted Jennifer to get hurt. \n\nThe judge ain't gonna throw this case out just yet, 'cause Jennifer's got some points. She can say that Martin knew spills were a problem, and he didn't do nothin' about it. Even though it might not be as clear-cut as \"Martin wanted Jennifer to fall,\"  it's still a decent argument. \n\nIt all started back in October of 2009. Rich Wayne, a D&D employee, told Martin about the applesauce spill. Martin was all, \"Dude, I'm busy eatin', deal with it yourself.\"  Then, Mary J. Haddigan, another worker, tells him again, and Martin gives the same lazy answer.  Well, half an hour later, Jennifer slips and breaks her back.  And get this,  five people already fell and got hurt that year because of spills!  \n\nSo, now Jennifer's takin' D&D to court, wantin' money for her pain and suffering, plus some extra dough to punish them for bein' reckless.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this Islam class I took like, four years back at CBC. We were always going back and forth about whether Islam was, like, a bad religion or not.  It's even more messed up now than back then, ya know? Since 9/11, the media went from all \"Islam is bad!\" to \"Islam is awesome!\" like, overnight. I mean, back in 2001, could ya even imagine a prez running with a name like Barack Obama, who's got a Muslim family history? \n\nThis Muhammad dude's story really got me thinking. See, I thought he was all about forcing people to convert, conquering tribes and making 'em Muslim. But this book paints him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble.  It's like he's the good guy who just, ya know, spread the truth, and people came to him on their own. \n\nThere's even some stuff that's kinda like Jesus' story, like when Muhammad, like, multiplied some mutton and milk for forty guys. It's all super shady, ya know? Like they're trying to make Muhammad look like some kind of miracle worker, to, like, steal Jesus' thunder.\n\nAnd get this, they got all these stories about how people converted, but they're all secondhand.  It's like, \"So-and-so heard from so-and-so who heard from...\" It's all fishy, man.\n\nThe worst part is, they're trying to make Muhammad out to be this perfect, humble, wise dude. But history says different. Muhammad was a warrior, man!  I just wonder if Muslims today know the real deal about this guy.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin' 'bout Christianity.  It's like this, Jesus had his own way of doin' things, ya know?  But then, after he was gone, things started to change. Kinda like when you leave a pizza out too long - it gets all weird and different. Christianity went on its own wild ride, gettin' further and further from Jesus' original message.\n\nNow, these days, everyone's all about change, right?  They wanna try new things and break the rules.  But there are still some folks stuck in the old ways, clingin' to what they know. They ain't gonna let go easy.\n\nBut here's the thing: more and more people are gonna start lookin' back, seein' all the stuff that got added to Christianity over the years. They're gonna wanna know what Jesus really meant, what he truly taught.  It might take a while, maybe decades, maybe even centuries, but it's gonna happen.\n\nThink of it like rewindin' a tape.  Christianity's gonna go back to its roots, strip away all the extra stuff, until it's just Jesus' pure teachings. People are gonna be like, \"Hey, remember when things were simpler?\"  And they'll start worshipin' like they did back in Jesus' time, just followin' his lead.\n\nThe church will still be around, leadin' the way, but everything's gonna be different.  All the different groups and denominations, they'll start to look more and more alike. It's like when the Roman Empire went from crushin' Christians to bein' ruled by 'em.\n\nHistory's full of these big shifts, y'know? It's like a rollercoaster, goin' up and down, changin' direction. And this next big shift's gonna be all about Christianity, goin' back to its original form, gettin' rid of all the extra stuff, and bringin' everyone together. \n\nAnd get this, a big part of it's gonna be seein' Jesus' words in a new way, like metaphors, not just plain ol' instructions.  It's like, he was tryin' to tell us somethin' deeper, somethin' we gotta figure out on our own.\n\nSo what happened after Jesus? Well, way back when, there was just Judaism. That was the start of it all, ya know? One God, the Bible, that's what it was all about.  The Jews, they weren't all on the same page, though. They had their different groups, like the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, and so on.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya somethin' about this book, *The Jungle*. It's a real eye-opener, man. It shows how humans, deep down, are kinda selfish, ya know? They're all about lookin' out for number one and makin' their lives better, but they don't care about anyone else, especially if that someone's lower on the food chain.\n\nYou see it everywhere in the book, especially with those factory owners and bosses. All they care about is makin' their companies bigger and richer, no matter what. They don't give a hoot about the people workin' for them or the damage they're doin' to the environment.\n\nSinclair, the guy who wrote it, paints a pretty grim picture. He describes these factories like giant, smokin' monsters, spewin' out pollution and stink.  He's sayin' these guys don't care about the people, the animals, nothin'!\n\nAnd those bosses? Forget about it! They treat their workers like dirt.  They make 'em work long hours, then just fire 'em without a second thought. No help, no nothin'. It's like they're slaves, trapped in this system with no way out.  \n\nThere weren't many rules back then to protect people, so these guys could get away with anything.  They pushed their workers to the limit, made 'em work in awful conditions. It's messed up, man. They expected people to just take it, to die in those factories or whatever.\n\nEven the unions weren't much help. They were more about makin' money off the workers than actually standin' up for 'em.\n\nIt's a tough story, but it shows a dark side of humanity. It makes you think about how we treat each other, how we let greed and power corrupt us.",
            "Okay, so like, some writers, ya know, they use super cool tricks to make you feel a certain way about stuff. It's like, they're trying to plant a vibe. Fitzgerald, the dude who wrote *The Great Gatsby*, he's a master at this. He's like, 'Hey, let's pair up some random words, just to see what kinda crazy feeling it makes'. He also loves using symbols, like colors, to sneak in these extra meanings.  \n\nTake colors, for example: gold, green, white, gray, even red and pink. Fitzgerald, he's got a whole system going on with these colors, and he uses them to give you a sneak peek into what's really important in the story.\n\nWhite and gray, they're like his secret weapons. He uses white to show you something fancy and high class, like,  'Look at Daisy, she's always dripping in white!' But then there's gray, which is like the tired, old version of white. It's like, 'This is all so boring and predictable'. He throws these colors everywhere at the beginning of the book, like, everyone's wearing white, even Gatsby's parties are kinda whitewashed. You see, Fitzgerald, he's setting the stage, building up this whole vibe.\n\nThen, there's all these little details, like, Nick going down \"white chasms\" or people's names being \"gray\" on a list. It's all about uniformity, like, everything is just the same, nothing special.\n\nSo, when Fitzgerald suddenly starts describing Daisy in white again, you get this feeling of, 'Oh, she's not really who she seems, she's just another pretty face in a sea of white'. And that's his point, man. He wants you to see how things aren't always what they seem, how even the prettiest things can be empty.",
            "So, check it out, this place in San Diego County called Potrero is a total paradise for growing stuff. They got sunshine all year round, so they grow all kinds of awesome stuff like tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, even peppers! And get this, people are crazy for organic food here. They got these cool farms where you can join up and get fresh veggies straight from the source, but everyone's always on a waiting list! Organic eggs and milk are like, the hottest thing. Some of these farms are even super chill and let you take tours, go birdwatching, and hike around. It's like a win-win, ya know?  The government's got programs to help farmers who do this kinda stuff, so they can make some dough while helping out the environment. \n\nBut here's the thing, organic farming ain't always easy. It takes a lot of elbow grease to keep those pesky bugs and weeds away without using chemicals. Plus, sometimes things don't grow as well as they do with regular farming. It's like, you gotta put in extra effort to make it work. \n\nNow, this one place in Potrero, it's 160 acres of chaparral, grasslands, and oak trees. It's right next to this huge forest called the Cleveland National Forest, and it's home to all sorts of cool critters, some of them endangered, like kangaroo rats, frogs, and even butterflies. It's been around forever, used by Native Americans first, then ranchers and wood sellers. \n\nI was checking out this website and found this farm nearby that's doing organic stuff. They're killing it! So, I figured this Potrero place could do the same thing.",
            "Listen up, 'cause this is important stuff. When you're dealin' with folks from a different scene, ya gotta get their groove. Culture ain't just some big ol' label, it's like a whole way of life, ya know? Don't go thinkin' everyone from the same place is all the same, 'cause that's a surefire way to mess things up.  Like, sayin' all Russians are stubborn or all Japanese are easygoing, that's just plain wrong.\n\nThe real deal is to figure out what makes that culture tick, what's important to 'em, and how that'll play out when you're tryin' to make a deal.  When you're meetin' folks from a different background, you're gonna see things through your own lens, and that's natural. But don't let that cloud your judgment.\n\nTo understand 'em, you gotta dig deep. Learn about their history, their beliefs, their hang-ups. Don't go tryin' to change 'em, just accept 'em for who they are, especially if you're the underdog at the table. And remember, respect goes a long way.  If you show respect for their customs and beliefs, it'll make things a whole lot smoother.\n\nCulture ain't just about countries either.  Even inside a company, there's a whole vibe goin' on.  Some places are all about long hours, others are laid-back. You can tell a lot by how folks dress, how they talk, how they get things done, even how they give back to the community. Just look at how different companies are here in America, from coast to coast, city to suburbs. It's wild how diverse things can be, even in one place.\n\nValues are the real key, though. They're the heart of a culture, the \"why\" behind everything. If a culture values saving face or harmony, you ain't gonna see them embarrassin' their company or boss just to win a deal.  And a culture that's all about tough negotiations? They ain't gonna settle for the first thing that comes along.\n\nSo, before you even sit down at the table, do your homework. Figure out what makes 'em tick, what they value. But don't forget, a little personal touch goes a long way too. Get to know your opponent, show 'em you're more than just a business deal. That's how you make a real connection.",
            "Okay, so these two brainiacs, Anselm and Aquinas, both think there's a Big Guy upstairs, ya know? And they both wanna prove it, like a weird game of one-upmanship. But since I'm way more down-to-earth, lemme break it down for ya.\n\nAnselm, he's all about lookin' inside yourself, like, \"Dude, God's already in your head, so you gotta believe!\" Kinda like when you know your goldfish is hungry even before he starts tappin' on the glass. Anselm thinks faith is the key, no need for all that fancy proof stuff. \n\nThen there's Aquinas, the logic master. He's like, \"Nah, man, I got five solid reasons why God's gotta be real!\" He's talkin' 'bout change, cause and effect, stuff like that. Like, if you see a bunch of pieces of a puzzle, you just KNOW there's a missing one, right? Aquinas says it's the same with God - the universe makes sense 'cause there's gotta be a Big Guy behind it all.\n\nSo, who's got the better argument? Honestly, both of 'em make some pretty good points. But neither one's gonna convince me without a little more than just words, ya know? I need some solid evidence, not just head-scratchin' theories.",
            "Yo, so like, way back in the day, like, super long ago, there was this dude named Buddha, right? He was a prince, but he was all, 'Nah, this royal life ain't for me.' So, he ditched it all and became enlightened. His teachings, they became this big thing called Buddhism. There's a bunch of different types of Buddhism, but the most hardcore one is called Theravada. It's like, over 2,500 years old, and things have changed a bit since Buddha was chillin'.\n\nTake this festival they have in Sri Lanka, for example. They call it the water-cutting ceremony. Monks and regular folks participate, and it's kinda religious, but Buddha never talked about this kinda thing. It's just one example of how Buddhism has evolved over time. It's not just the goofy traditions, but even the deep, core beliefs have changed a little.\n\nWhy? Well, there are a bunch of reasons. Some stuff comes from inside the Buddhist community, like, changes made by monks and regular Buddhists. Other stuff comes from outside, like, people who aren't Buddhist. Sometimes these outside forces are cool, sometimes they're a total drag. \n\nLet's break down some key terms first, 'cause we're gonna use them a lot.  We got 'internal' and 'external' forces. Internal means stuff coming from Buddhists, whether they're monks or not. External means stuff from people outside Buddhism.  Then we have 'hostile' and 'benign'. Hostile forces mess with Buddhism, try to hurt it, or whatever. Benign forces don't really care about Buddhism, they just do their thing, which might accidentally help or hurt Buddhism.  \n\nAlright, now let's get down to the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists believe in the 'Triple Gem': Buddha, the teachings (Dhamma), and the community (Sangha). The Dhamma is basically the holy scriptures, like the Tripitaka.  There's the Sutta Pitaka (Buddha's words), the Vinaya Pitaka (rules for monks), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (the deep, philosophical stuff). \n\nThey talk about things like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (suffering is real), and Anicca (everything's temporary).  You gotta get a handle on these ideas to break free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth.  When you do that, you also ditch all the bad stuff: lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). You become enlightened, like a boss.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka has rules for how to live. Regular folks have five precepts: don't kill, don't lie, don't steal, don't mess around sexually, and don't get wasted on drugs. Monks, they've got a whole lotta rules to follow. The most important idea in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths:\n\n1. Life is suffering (Dukkha).\n2. Suffering is caused by attachment.\n3. Suffering can be overcome.\n4. There's a path to overcome suffering (the Eightfold Path).",
            "So, get this: America and Mexico, they were like, totally at odds for, like, forever! I'm talking 57 years, from 1836 to 1893! It was a real thing, man, like a super intense rivalry. Remember that time America went and smashed Mexico in that war back in 1846? Yeah, that was a big deal. America took Texas and all that Southwest land for itself. Boom! Total power move.  \n\nBut it wasn't just about land, ya know? They also butted heads over religion, culture, the whole shebang. Like, imagine being all different and then having to live next door to each other. It's a recipe for disaster, right? \n\nIt's kinda like, you know, when your neighbor's dog keeps digging in your garden. You gotta be all \"Hey, chill out, dude!\" about it. Except instead of a dog, it's a whole country. \n\nAnyway, America and Mexico had their fair share of run-ins, like a whole bunch of them. They were like, \"Nope, not gonna share!\" over stuff like who should be in charge and what's considered cool.  And get this, an old dude named David M. Pletcher said that America's had way more drama with Mexico and Cuba than with any other country. Not cool, man.\n\nReligion was a major sticking point too. Back then, America was all \"We don't dig that Catholicism!\" and Mexico was like, \"Screw you, we're sticking with our faith!\" It's kind of like the whole Cold War thing, but instead of Communism, it was Catholic-phobia. It's like they thought if you didn't believe the same thing, you were the enemy.\n\nAnd guess what? It all stemmed from those old colonial times when England and Spain were at each other's throats.  They passed down all that bad blood to their kids, and America and Mexico just couldn't seem to get over it. \n\nThey fought over borders, stole each other's stuff, and pulled all sorts of shady stuff. It was a mess, man! But eventually, Mexico realized they needed America for stuff, and America wanted to control their economy instead of just taking their land. So, the rivalry fizzled out, but it took a long time.",
            "So, fifteen years back, BAM! I'm hit with this crazy illness out of nowhere. Never even heard of it before!  See, I was a nurse, figured it was the safe bet.  Everyone kept saying, \"You'll always have a job, people get sick all the time!\"  So I did it, even though my real dream was to be a scientist or maybe a journalist, or heck, both!  But here I was, 46, single, no cash in the bank, and totally outta commission.  Now, fifteen years and counting on disability, I've got nothin' left to call my own.  Scrapping by, that's the name of the game. Every day's a fight to keep my head above water, a constant battle for security, safety, and even just my self-respect.\n\nNothing's a sure thing anymore, but here's the deal: without my family and a few awesome friends, I wouldn't have made it this far. Believe me, when disaster hits, strong doesn't even begin to describe it. \n\nLife throws curveballs, big and small, all the time. No amount of planning can stop everything. Some stuff, you just can't handle alone.\n\nWe need to stop relying so much on the government, it's crumbling faster than a stale cookie. But I'd rather see folks helping each other out, building each other up, asking for help when they need it.  \n\nThose Conservatives keep talking about how \"rugged individualism\" built this country, but back in the day, what got folks through tough times wasn't being tough, it was kindness, respect, and sharing what you had. Those pioneers crossing the Rockies? They didn't make it without lookin' out for each other.\n\n\nSo yeah, be prepared. I am. Got my disaster kit, first aid, water purifiers, plastic sheeting for the windows, the whole shebang. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches... you name it, I got it.  If you've got the space and the means, a little farm and some canning supplies?  Go for it!  Wood stove, too, if you're not stuck in an apartment. \n\nBut here's the kicker: get to know your neighbors.",
            "Okay, so, like, why do critters evolve the way they do? Is there some kinda rulebook for evolution, ya know? Back in the day, this dude named D'Arcy Thompson said we're still figuring out how to talk about living things in numbers, and wouldn't ya know it, that's still kinda true. But, lately, folks have been using math to try and understand how shells grow, like, from baby to adult, and how that's changed over time. We're doing the same thing with these cool clams called Prunum. We're taking pictures of their shells, measuring all sorts of stuff, and then using computer programs to make up new shell shapes.  It's like, \"What if a shell did this instead of that?\" Kinda like when you play with LEGOs, but with science! We're also doing experiments to see how these different shapes actually work.\n\nThink of a shell like a spiral staircase that goes all the way around. Each step is a whorl, and they all spin around a central column called the columella. Sometimes the steps get bigger, sometimes they stay the same, and there's a line separating each step, called a suture. Usually, the biggest step is the last one, called the body whorl. The rest of the steps are called the spire, and the very tip is called the apex. And there's a hole at the bottom called the aperture where the clam sticks its head out. \n\nYou can look at a shell from different angles, like from the top, bottom, front, or back.\n\nCounting the whorls is kinda like slicing a cake. You look at the top, find the first line, and then count how many slices there are. We even look at how the opening of the shell changes as it grows. Imagine tracing the path of the opening as the clam builds its shell, that's like a map of its growth! We can even use math to make that map and see what would happen if the clam grew differently. Kinda neat, huh?",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya about Indonesia and their baby peeps.  For the last ten years, things haven't been changin' much when it comes to babies dyin' before they even turn one.  They're doin' alright with stuff like clean water and toilets, but when it comes to keepin' moms and babies healthy, they ain't quite makin' the cut.  \n\nTurns out, they're gettin' better at havin' babies with helpers around, but not all helpers are created equal.  Some are just midwives, and they can't handle tough situations, ya know?  Like when a mama starts bleedin' too much after givin' birth, those midwives are outta their league.  So even though they're makin' progress, it's kinda fake news.  Also, fewer kids are seein' doctors for tummy aches and stuff.  And postnatal care? Forget about it, that's a mess too.\n\nAnd here's the kicker:  cesarean sections are way too low, especially in the country parts.  In the city, they do 'em a decent amount, but in the sticks, not so much.  It's like the rich folks get all the good stuff.  \n\nThe poor folks are strugglin' to get care too, 'cause it costs too much.  \n\nSo what's the answer?  Should they focus on specific programs or fix the whole health system?   Programs are easier, they get results faster, but they can also mess things up.  Like, they might pour all their money into one thing, leaving other stuff to rot. Plus, ya get a bunch of programs doin' the same thing, but all disorganized.  Talk about a headache!",
            "Alright, so Victorian books are all about fancy details and rich folks, right? But then there's these two, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" that kinda break the mold. They're Victorian, but they're like, \"Nope, we're gonna throw in some mystery and weird stuff!\"  It makes the characters way more interesting because we get a peek into their heads and what makes them tick.\n\nLike, take this bit from \"Oliver Twist\":\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nSee, in these stories, things get kinda dreamlike and mysterious, especially with Oliver. It's like a window into his mind, showing us what's hurting him and how he sees the crazy stuff going on around him.\n\nWhen Oliver gets shot, it's like he's reliving it in a nightmare. He's overwhelmed, like he has no control, and everything feels numb. It's scary because it shows how broken he is and how much Fagin has messed with him. It makes you wonder who's really in charge of his fate.\n\n\nIn \"Wuthering Heights,\" it's different, but the mystery is still there. It's more about the darkness and hidden secrets of the characters.",
            "Okay, so picture this: a couple years back, I was helping out at this after-school program, you know, tutoring those little elementary schoolers. I was pretty good at English and reading, so that's what I mostly focused on.  Then this kid, Adrian, comes along. He was in like third or fourth grade, I think, and he was really struggling to read. It was weird, man. Some letters he'd nail, others? Not even close. It was like his brain was playing some kind of  letter-pronouncing game, and it hated him.  See, Adrian was Latino, and he spoke perfect English, which made it even weirder.  We were stuck in this reading rut until one day, Adrian's mom came in.  She didn't speak a lick of English, just Spanish.  My Spanish was like, \"hola\" and \"gracias\" level, but somehow we managed to chat.  BAM! It hit me like a ton of bricks. Adrian wasn't dumb, he just didn't know the English alphabet that well. It was like teaching someone to read using a completely different alphabet. I don't know if that helped him much in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now. \n\nAnyway, that's why I'm bringing this whole language barrier thing up. It's a big deal, especially here in California. It's not always as obvious as you think.  Even a kid who speaks English perfectly can still struggle with reading if they haven't got a good grasp of the alphabet. Everyone knows this is a problem, but what can we do about it? Adrian was kind of a simple case - some extra English reading help, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated.  There's no magic bullet.  Dual language programs, immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of it works alone.  We need to mix and match! \n\nFirst off, dual language programs are awesome, not just for kids whose first language is Spanish, but for everyone. Studies show they actually do better in school!  People are scared about this, saying it wastes resources and benefits only a few.  But that's wrong. Think about it - if this was the norm, not the exception, everyone would benefit!\n\nSo how do we do it?  Do we make all teachers bilingual? Nah, that's crazy.  But I think we can have bilingual helpers, tutors, whatever you call them.",
            "From the time we're little munchkins, most folks are told there's somethin' bigger out there, somethin' way beyond our tiny brains. Some get sent to Sunday School, others to Temple, or maybe they just bug out on their own lookin' for answers.  A lotta us just go with whatever religion our parents gave us, but some wise guys, they say \"Nah, there ain't nothin' but this here brain and this here world.\"  We might even change our minds a bunch, findin' new ways to think about things. No matter what, we're all on this quest to figure out who we are, through our own messed up, unique views on what's holy and what ain't. We're all searchin' for a light in the darkness, somethin' to guide us outta the shadows and into the sunshine.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my old man said when I asked him what bird he liked best. We were sittin' on the porch, listenin' to the rain poundin' on the roof like a freakin' drum solo. Water was pourin' down the gutters, drownin' the plants by the steps.  He looked out at the rain, like he was half-searchin' for somethin', half-rememberin'. He'd gotten thinner, clothes hangin' off him like a bad Halloween costume.  His hair was gettin' thinner too, like a spooky, bald spot was comin' for him. He kept lookin' at the rain, wouldn't meet my eyes.  I felt lonely, scared, and couldn't bring myself to talk to him about how much I was gonna miss him.  Talkin' about it woulda made it real, and that was too much for both of us.  So I just hugged him, sat back down, scooted my chair closer, and joined him in watchin' the rain fall on that June night.\n\nMy dad kicked the bucket in December that year, five days after I turned twenty-two.  The chemo and radiation didn't make him feel any better, but it kept him around for a few months longer than the docs thought he'd last.  I couldn't say what good that did, though.  What kinda God does that?  Alone in the dark, I didn't pray.  If God was out there, I figured he stopped listenin' to me ages ago. \n\nI didn't wanna be there when he left this world for whatever came next.  So I wasn't.  Couldn't watch the man who made me fade away.  I wanted to remember him the way he lived, not the way he died. Besides, I knew my dad better than anyone else, better even than his own family.  I knew he wouldn't want me to be some sad spectator at his death. I curled up in bed for three days, waitin' for the news.\n\nNobody even called.",
            "So, get this, people have been yapping about Gothic novels forever. Some say they're a total snoozefest, others think they're the bee's knees, ya know, all \"terrible sublime\" and stuff. This dude Ian Watt, real smart guy, says they're basically a \"weird mix of old and new,\" which kinda makes sense when you think about it.\n\nThis whole thing started with this book, \"The Castle of Otranto,\" by this fella Horace Walpole. He took all these old school, like, super dramatic theatre ideas and mixed them up with the newfangled way of writing novels back then – you know, where you get up close and personal with the characters' minds.  He calls it a \"Gothic story,\" and BAM, the genre was born!\n\nGothic novels are like a throwback to the spooky, medieval vibes, with castles, knights, and all that jazz. But even back then, \"Gothic\" was kinda seen as old-fashioned and clunky compared to the \"modern\" stuff. \n\nBut here's the kicker – even though Gothic is, like, ancient history, it still sticks around because it's got this cool combo of drama and mystery. It's like, both out of date and totally fresh at the same time, which is kinda mind-blowing.\n\nOne big theme in Gothic novels is this thing called chivalry. It's all about knights being brave, honorable, and totally awesome. Gothic writers loved it because they thought modern society was lacking that whole chivalrous vibe.  They used chivalry to make the \"Gothic past\" look super idealized and romantic, kinda like a sneak peek at the future of the Romantic era. \n\nWalpole, the dude who started it all, was writing during some seriously messed up times politically. He was worried sick about the future, and maybe he thought the good ol' days of chivalry were gone for good. In his book, he shows this through his character Frederic, who's basically a perfect knight in shining armor. \n\nHe's a prince, he's been through some serious heartache, and he's supposed to be dead. It's like a dramatic, over-the-top version of a knight, which kinda sets the stage for the whole Gothic trope of going overboard.",
            "Alright, lemme break down this whole \"supply chain\" thing for ya. It's basically how stuff gets from the \"I want it!\" stage all the way to your doorstep. Think of it like a big, crazy race with lots of different players. \n\nThis guy named Keith Oliver, back in 1982, was the first to use the fancy term \"supply chain management.\" He figured out that to make things run smooth and get stuff to folks fast, ya gotta plan ahead, make it happen, and keep an eye on everything. \n\nThere are six main players in this supply chain game: making stuff, getting the stuff, keeping track of the stuff, deciding where stuff goes, moving stuff around, and sharing info about the stuff. Managers gotta juggle all these things to make sure customers are happy.\n\nFirst off, you gotta make the stuff!  That's the \"production\" part. It's like the first step in a big recipe, where you figure out what to make, how much to make, where to make it, and who's gonna do it. Managers gotta know what people want, so they check out the market – that's like lookin' at what's hot and trendy. \n\nOnce they know what folks want, they decide what to produce and how much. Then they gotta pick the best place to make it, making sure it's got everything it needs and can handle the workload. \n\nNext up is \"supply,\" which is all about finding the best people and places to help make your stuff. Maybe ya got different parts of the production process spread out, or maybe ya wanna outsource some stuff to other companies. That's where \"velocity\" comes in – doin' things fast and cheap while still keeping quality high.",
            "So, picture this, right?  Ellen Page, that chick from Juno, she's standing on a street corner, holding up this cardboard sign.  And get this, it says, \"Hitler is alive in Burma!\" Can you believe it?  Burma, which is also called Myanmar, is this weird country in Southeast Asia where these guys in charge, the military, they've been running things since 1962.  They're kinda like the bullies of the world, always making trouble and not letting anybody else have a say.  \n\nBack in 2007, a bunch of monks, like the peaceful kind, they decided to stand up to these guys.  It started with these little protests, like, \"Hey, we want a better life!\" But the military, they got all scared and started beating people up.  They even went into the monk's temples and trashed the whole place. It got so bad that journalists who were just trying to do their job got thrown in jail.  One guy, Kenji, he was just taking pictures, and they killed him!  \n\nThis isn't new, though.  Governments have always been like that, trying to boss people around and keep all the power for themselves.  Like, remember those Roman emperors way back when?  They thought they were gods!  And then there's Japan, where the emperor is supposed to be a god too!  And don't even get me started on our president, George W. Bush. He hangs out with this guy, Ted Haggard, who's like the leader of all the dumb people.  \n\nYou know, there have been other times when people have tried to stand up to these bad governments. Like in China, back in 1989, students and stuff, they protested, but the government just crushed them. It's messed up. And in Rwanda, in the 90s, they killed tons of people because of their religion or something.  And of course, there's Hitler, who killed millions of Jews.",
            "Duke Ellington, he was a real jazz legend, ya know?  He played piano, but he was even better at making music for his whole band. He knew how to write tunes that let each player shine, even if it was just a little solo. He was like a conductor, but he also knew how to make the whole orchestra sound like one big, crazy good instrument. \n\nHeck, he even used voices like instruments in some of his stuff. Like this song \"Creole Love Call\".  It's a slow blues song, and the singer, he's not singing words, he's just making sounds, like an instrument!  It's kinda cool.\n\nThis guy, he knew how to make each player sound their best, and he knew how to make them all sound good together. He wrote some of the coolest, most amazing jazz music ever!  He even used a trumpet guy named Bubber Miley and a singer named Baby Cox to do this thing where they were callin' and respondin' to each other. It was like they were making music with their voices and their horns at the same time.\n\nThen there's this other song, \"It Don't Mean a Thing\".  Ellington had this trombone player, Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton. He was a regular in Ellington's band, and in this song, he plays the first note of the song on his trombone, and it's like, BAM! You know that's Ellington right away!",
            "She'd always felt this hole inside, somethin' she couldn't quite put her finger on. This need, this want, that just wouldn't quit. It started when she was 14, hittin' that awkward teenage phase, and it was still there at 17.  Now, she knew it wasn't somethin' she could just buy, it was somethin' more... someone. But nobody, not a single dude, had ever caught her eye.  Some had tried, bless their hearts, makin' all those goofy moves, but nothin' clicked. She wracked her brain, tryin' to figure out what was up with her. Theories bounced around, but nothin' stuck. So, she just kept livin', always wonderin' what this itch was all about.\n\nHome life was usually pretty chill. Her folks were cool cats, never fightin' and rarely even gettin' into it with her.  Arguments were mostly about her tryin' to spread her wings and show 'em who she was.  They were a calm bunch, but she brought the energy, the fun, the whole shebang. That, plus her sweet personality, made her a real hit wherever she went.\n\n\nBut today wasn't a chill day.  She was wanderin' around, lookin' for somethin' to spark her creativity, when she heard a yelp from the kitchen. It was her mom, and her voice sounded scared. She bolted in there, heart poundin', shoutin', \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?!\" There she was, sprawled out on the floor, whimperin' in pain. \"Ow... swe - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital,\" she managed between breaths.  \n\nHer daughter sprang into action, her mom's words urgent and scared. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where to get ya,\" she said, already thinkin' about how she'd get her to the car.  Her mom pointed weakly, and her daughter, thankful for those self-defense classes, scooped her up and carried her to the car. \n\n\nThe hospital was a whirlwind of smells - antiseptic, sickness, and a whole lotta fear. But her daughter was focused on one thing: her mom. She rushed her in, hollerin' for help.  Doctors and nurses swarmed around, wheelin' her mom away for treatment, leavin' her daughter sittin' on a bench, worry gnawin' at her.\n\n\nTurns out, her mom had fallen off a step stool reachin' for a vase on a high shelf.",
            "Alright, so picture this: there's this super healthy way of eating called the \"Mediterranean Diet,\" but lemme tell ya, it's a bit much for some folks. So, they came up with a simpler version called the 'alternate Mediterranean diet,' (or aMed for short). Basically, it's all about munching on plants like fruits, veggies, nuts, and beans, while keeping the meat and fatty stuff to a minimum. It's like, \"Hey, let's load up on good stuff and ditch the bad!\" \n\nEveryone knows that eating healthy is good for ya, right? Well, some earlier studies showed that folks who followed the Mediterranean Diet had less heart trouble and lived longer. This new study wanted to see if the aMed diet had the same effect, especially when it came to strokes. They followed a bunch of nurses for 20 years, asking 'em about what they ate every few years. And guess what? The nurses who ate the most like their Mediterranean diet buddies had a lower chance of getting heart disease and strokes!  They kept track of everything, like smoking, exercise, and even how many vitamins they popped. It's all about being super careful, ya know?\n\nSo, the study found that the more plants you eat and the less junk you stuff your face with, the less likely you are to have a heart attack or stroke.  Pretty simple, right?",
            "Back in 2007, things got REAL hairy in America. People were losing jobs faster than you can say \"sub-prime mortgage,\" and houses were going for less than a used pizza cutter.  The big money guys, the ones with names like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, they were singing the blues. See, they'd been handing out loans like candy to folks who couldn't really afford 'em –  like giving a goldfish a credit card!  And then, BAM! Those loans went south faster than a fry cook on vacation.  \n\nIt all started way back in the Clinton days, when everyone was feelin' good and the economy was hummin'. The Prez wanted another term, so they loosened up the rules on loans, thinking it'd make everyone happy. But, it was like lettin' loose a pack of rabid squirrels in a china shop.  \n\nSome smart guy over at the New York Times, Steven Holmes, saw what was comin' a mile away. He's like, \"Yo, this is gonna blow up!\" But nobody listened.  \n\nThen came those fancy new mortgage things, like adjustable-rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. They sound complicated, right? That's 'cause they are!  It was like weaving a giant, tangled mess of financial threads, and when one thread snapped, the whole thing started unravelin'.\n\nAnd unravel it did. The housing bubble popped, and all those fancy investment banks were left holdin' the bag. They were in deep doo-doo, like a raccoon in a garbage can. Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers?  Gone. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? Government bailouts, baby!  \n\nSo, there you have it. A bunch of bad decisions, a whole lotta greed, and a dash of economic ignorance led to a real mess.",
            "Okay, so you wanna tell a story, right?  It's like showing off your best moves, painting a picture with words, making your readers go \"Wow!\"  Except, sometimes, you end up droning on and on, like a broken record.  That's exposition, and it's the writer's kryptonite.\n\nSee, we've all heard \"Show, don't tell,\" but sometimes even the best writers get tripped up.  They get caught up in explaining *everything*, turning their story into a boring history lesson.  It's like that friend who always has to tell you *every single detail* about their day, even the boring parts.\n\nExposition is like that friend, except it's your story, and you're the one making everyone yawn.  In movies, it's when a character starts dumping information on another, like they're reading a Wikipedia article aloud.  In books, it's when the author does the same thing.\n\nThink about it this way: you're reading a story, and suddenly you're told the heroine met her soulmate, got married in a huge fancy ceremony, and then BAM! He's murdered right in front of her.  Do you really want to spend two pages reading about it, with only a couple lines of dialogue for each character?\n\nNo way!  You want to *feel* the love they shared, see it in their actions and words, understand why his death is so devastating.  You want to see the heroine's grief, her strength, her vulnerability.  \n\nIt's all about adding depth, making the story come alive.  Instead of just telling us about the husband, let us *experience* him.  Show us his personality, his humor, his flaws.\n\nDon't just tell us the characters met, got married, and he died.  Give us the story behind those events.  Make it real. Make it emotional. Make it unforgettable.",
            "Alright, check this out! I just watched these two news things from Columbus, Ohio, like, totally bogus! First up was NBC 4 this morning, August 13th, 2011, a real live one. They had this story about this dude in Ashley, Ohio, who stabbed his wife, but, like, they didn't even say her name. The creep's name was Shad Hostettler. Man, his mugshot was straight-up scary!  They only talked about it for a couple of minutes, said he stabbed her a bunch of times and got caught, but that was it.\n\nThen they had this thing about this Travis Buyers, 18 years old, got shot in Sharon Woods and was in real bad shape. No arrests, no suspects, just the SWAT Team sniffing around. Seemed kinda short, maybe 'cause it wasn't some white kid or something. It's like, if a white person gets messed with the news freaks out, but if it's a minority, they barely mention it. \n\nNext, they showed this hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, a .22 bullet, some dude shot it! They were offering five grand for info on the shooter. Then, boom, talk about the weather, rain and thunderstorms coming Saturday, just a quickie though, gotta keep you watching, ya know? \n\nThey also had this story about a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. Some dude, black, wearing a hoodie, six-foot, about 150 pounds. They kept saying he was black and how dark his skin was, kinda weird, yeah?\n\nFinally, they talked about this Rene Rodriguez, a drug lord from Texas, doing time for selling weed to Ohio. Instead of saying 25 years, they said \"300 months.\"  What's up with that? And they kept saying he was Hispanic, which didn't really matter to the story, you know?",
            "So, there's this thing about brothers, ya know? It's like, this super strong connection, like nothin' else.  It's got all these crazy feelings mixed up in it - love, pride, jealousy, even anger sometimes.  Brothers get each other, like, *deeply*. They see themselves in their brother, more than anyone else. But sometimes, when things go south, real bad, that bond shows its true colors, good or bad.  And that stuff, those feelings, they can really mess you up.  You gotta deal with the consequences, ya know? 'Cause when you look your brother straight in the eye and see yourself lookin' back, you see the real you, not how people think you are. It's in your actions, what you do, that shows what you're really made of.\n\nThis story, \"The Scarlet Ibis\",  it's all about that brother stuff.  These two guys, they got this intense connection, but it's messed up, kinda.  They're in this place, all beautiful and green, and they're on this crazy trip that ain't gonna end well.  There's this big fight, pride and disappointment clashing, and only one of 'em makes it out alive.\n\nThe story uses these brothers, Doodle and the narrator, to show how messed up this whole thing can get. The narrator, he's all about pride, from the start. He wants a brother who can keep up with him, someone who can do all the cool stuff he wants to do. Doodle, though, he's different. He's weak, can barely walk, and he's doomed from the start. The narrator's dreams, they get crushed.  He even thinks about killing Doodle, can you believe that? But then Doodle smiles at him, and... well, that changes things. It shows that deep down, he loves his brother, even if he's a pain in the neck sometimes.",
            "Yo, check it! This brain thing is wild, right? Back in the day, folks thought it was like a wax tablet, then papyrus, then a book, and now they're sayin' it's like a computer. But hold up! Don't get too caught up in these comparisons, 'cause they don't tell the whole story. \n\nSee, this brain of yours, it's like a total info-processing machine. It grabs stuff from your senses – touch, sound, sight – and turns it into electrical signals. Then it's like a crazy remix, all these signals bouncing around, getting analyzed from different angles. It's called bottom-up and top-down processing. Imagine you see a black box on a white background. Bottom-up is like figuring out the basics: \"Hey, there's a shape, it's black, it's on a white thing.\" Top-down is like using your brainpower to go, \"Aha! It's a box!\"\n\nBut here's the kicker: your brain's got this filter, like a bouncer at a club, deciding what's important and what gets tossed aside. You see tons of grass when you look down, but your brain's like, \"Nah, not worth remembering.\" But if someone shouts your name in a crowd, bam! It's front and center. So it's all about prioritizing, yo!\n\nAnd speaking of remembering, your brain's got different storage compartments: sensory, working, and long-term. It's like filing cabinets, each with its own purpose. Sensory memory is fleeting, like a passing thought. Working memory holds stuff for a short while, like remembering a phone number. Long-term memory is the big vault, where all your experiences and knowledge chill. \n\nBut how's all this knowledge organized? That's a big mystery. Some say it's like a network, with ideas connected like branches on a tree. Others think it's more like a giant puzzle, with pieces fitting together in complex ways. \n\nIt's a wild ride, this brain thing, but it's what makes us, well, us.",
            "Yo, check it! This book, \"Brave New World,\" by Huxley, is totally dissing technology and the whole capitalist system. It's set up like a messed-up future where everyone's all about being part of the group and chasing instant happiness. They're basically puppets, man, dancing to the tune of the World Controller. This dude's got all the power, and he's running the show.\n\nThis book's got some deep stuff going on, like this Marxist thing. You know, it talks about how society's rigged, how everyone's the same, man, and how the rich guys are totally screwing over the poor folks. It's like Huxley saw the future and was like, \"Whoa, this is messed up!\"\n\nHe's using this thing called \"false consciousness,\" which basically means the people are so busy chasing stuff they don't even realize they're being manipulated. They're all about buying stuff and getting their kicks, but they don't see the big picture. It's like they're brainwashed! The World Controller's like the ultimate puppet master, controlling everything from the get-go.\n\nAnd it's not just about money, man. It's about power. The rich guys are on top, and they keep the poor guys down. It's a total power trip.\n\nBut here's the kicker: the people in this book, they don't even care! They're so used to being controlled that they don't even question it. They're like, \"Yeah, this is how it's supposed to be.\" It's freakin' scary, man.\n\nThey don't have real relationships or feelings. They're all just shallow and superficial. It's like Huxley's saying that technology and capitalism are killing our humanity. We're becoming robots, man, just like the ones in that crazy future!",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this campus, man. I've been here for like, two and a half years, which is, like, four and a half semesters in their weird college speak. Getting around this place is a total drag, lemme tell ya. My first year I was stuck in these East Halls dorms, way out on the edge of campus, like, you could practically see the stadium from there.  Getting to class, especially to those places like Willard, which is like, in the middle of everything, was a freakin' marathon, especially when the weather decided to act up, which, let's be real, is, like, all the time here in State College. \n\nSo, I was chatting with this old grad, not much older than me, and he told me that back in the day, East Halls was like, totally isolated. There was, like, this massive wasteland between it and the rest of the campus. Now, it's all filled up with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments. It's like they just keep expanding this place, making it even harder to get from point A to point B.\n\nWhat's the answer to this mobility mess? Bikes, man!  Bikes are the way to go. But it's not just about having the bike; the campus needs to be built for bikers. This friend of mine, he got back into biking after, like, a long break, and he was all, \"Dude, why did I ever stop?\" He was like, \"Bikes are the only way to get around.\" \n\nBesides being good for your bod, bikes are the most efficient way to travel.  A bowl of oatmeal and some pedaling and you're good for, like, 30 miles.\n\nNow, I live off campus, just as far out as some dorms.  The smartest move I made this year? Buying a bike. My classes are in Thomas building, which is, like, a 25-minute walk from my place. On a bike? Five minutes, tops, if I push it.  The only problem? Pollock Road, the quickest way to Thomas, is, like, a pain in the butt, whether you're on a bike or walking. \n\nWalking's cool too, but I'm too busy for that. Without my bike, walking would be my only option, and that's, like, a whole other story. Walking to Thomas every day would add, like, 30-40 minutes to my day. That's, like, two and a half hours a week! And that's just Thomas. Add everything else, all the other classes, appointments, and stuff, and that's way too much time wasted."
