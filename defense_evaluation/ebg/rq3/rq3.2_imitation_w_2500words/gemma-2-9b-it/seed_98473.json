            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "So listen up, 'cause Sa2b's about to lay some truth on ya! See, I'm thinkin' about goin' full-on social worker, helpin' out those lil' rugrats who've had a rough go of it, ya know?  And maybe lend a hand to families that are, let's say, seein' some tough times. Now, lemme tell ya, I'm all about servin' others, treatin' everyone with respect, and doin' the right thing, ya dig? That ain't just some social worker mumbo jumbo, that's how I roll in life.\n\nTruth be told, I've always wanted to make a difference, but didn't know exactly how.  Back in high school and college, I saw folks tryin' to run from their problems, doin' some real whack stuff to cope. It made me wanna do somethin'.  I even got myself a psychology degree, but still wasn't sure what path to take. \n\nThen one summer, I met this kid, sixteen years old and lookin' all nervous. My buddy was takin' care of him 'cause he was runnin' from his abusive parents. Turns out, the kid called the cops on 'em! So I figured I'd lend a hand. I talked to the cops, told 'em I was a recent grad, and they asked me to talk to the parents. Let me tell ya, those folks were shifty! They were all nervous and makin' excuses about their son bein' a manipulator. After that, I knew right then and there I wanted to be a social worker, helpin' kids like that get the support they need.\n\nAnd another thing that's really important to me is social justice. Society always goes on about how special each individual is, but then they try to make us all the same.  It's like, if we're all so unique, why are we always tryin' to fit in?  I'm unique, and I ain't gonna apologize for it! Through high school and college, I stood up for what's right whenever I could: dyed my hair crazy colors, wore what I wanted, pierced my ears, joined the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance, fought against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it.  I believe in standin' up for what's right, and I'll keep doin' it!",
            "Okay, so check it out. This paper wants to break down insomnia, you know, that whole not-sleeping thing.  It's lookin' at two main ways people think about it: the biology side and the social/cultural side.  \n\nOn the biology side, they're talkin' genes, family history, and all that stuff that's, like, hard-wired into your body. Like, maybe you got a messed up gene that messes with your sleep.  They're also talkin' about how our brains work, especially this part called the hypothalamus. It's like the sleep-wake control center.\n\nThe social/cultural side is all about your environment, like where you live, who you hang with, and how much money you got.  They think these things can totally affect your sleep too.\n\nThis paper looks at a bunch of studies, like, real science stuff, to see if these models, the biology and the social stuff, actually make sense. They even point out the good and bad parts of each study.  \n\nFirst, they talk about different types of sleep problems. Like, insomnia (can't fall asleep), hypersomnia (too much sleep), narcolepsy (falling asleep randomly), and nightmares. Then they get specific about insomnia.\n\nThey found this one study where they messed with mice brains and found that these receptors called GABAB receptors play a big role in sleep.  Like, if you mess with these receptors, you mess with sleep. They think this might be true for humans too.\n\nSo, if you have a messed up GABAB receptor, maybe that's why you can't sleep.

            "Alright, so check it out, this thing called CAPD, it's like when your brain's not quite getting the message from your ears, you know? It's not that you can't hear, it's more like your brain's having trouble figuring out what it's hearing.  \n\nThink of it like this: You hear a bunch of sounds, like a bunch of people talking and music playing, but your brain's getting mixed up trying to figure out who's saying what and what's going on.  \n\nThey've been figuring out how to spot this stuff for a while now, back in the '50s, people started noticing kids who had trouble understanding what they heard.  They figured out some tests to see if someone's brain was having trouble with sounds, like trying to pick out words from a bunch of noise or telling the difference between similar sounds.\n\nCAPD can show up in a bunch of different ways.  Some folks might have trouble telling where a sound is coming from, or they might struggle to understand what someone's saying if there's a lot of background noise.  Some people might have trouble understanding jokes or sarcasm because their brain's not picking up on the changes in someone's voice. \n\nTo figure out if someone has CAPD, they do a bunch of tests, like listening for sounds, figuring out what words they hear, or paying attention to changes in sounds.\n\nThe tricky part is that there's no single test that's perfect for diagnosing CAPD.

And get this, she's so good at it that Olivia,  this rich lady, falls head over heels for \"Cesario,\" thinking he's a dude! \"Stay, my lord, Cesario, husband.\" (5.1.138)  Not to mention, she has these feelings for Orsino, who's totally smitten with her, but thinks she's a dude.  \"Boy, you've told me a thousand times/ You must never love a woman like me.\" (5.1. 260-261)\n\nTwelfth Night is like a mirror reflecting how pretending can bring hidden feelings to the surface. Olivia and Orsino might be dealing with stuff they didn't even know they felt. Maybe Olivia's attracted to Cesario because he looks like a guy, or maybe she secretly likes women?  It's hard to say.  But Shakespeare seems to be poking fun at how people back then judged folks based on looks alone.  Olivia switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian (Viola's twin brother) super quick, and treats Cesario like family, not a love interest: “Sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "Alright, so ya know how everyone's always sayin' the Germans were real rough on the natives back in the day? Like, total bad guys?  Well, true enough, especially in South West Africa where they went overboard with the whole \"killin' everyone\" thing. But hold your horses, it wasn't all bad everywhere. Germany ran a bunch of colonies, and each one was different, kinda like how some folks in your family are total weirdos while others are kinda cool. \n\nWhen the Brits took over German East Africa (that's Tanganyika now), they were surprised to find a bunch of smart Africans who could read and write. Turns out, the Germans actually did a decent job in some places, like Kamerun. But South West Africa? That's where things got weird. \n\nUnlike in East Africa where the government built schools and stuff for the locals, in South West Africa, they kinda just shrugged and said, \"Hey, missionaries, you take care of it.\"  They threw a little bit of money their way, but not much. Meanwhile, they went hog wild building schools for the white folks, like they were the only ones who mattered. This messed things up big time in South West Africa, even after the Germans packed their bags.  While other colonies had plenty of smart, educated Africans, South West Africa was left behind.\n\nSo what happened? Why was South West Africa so different? Well, a bunch of stuff, like the people who lived there, the government, and the economy. This paper is gonna dig into all that and see what we can figure out.\n\nThere's a ton of stuff written about German schools in their colonies. Most of it's in German and was written way back when they were running the show. Back then, people were mostly just tryin' to figure out what these schools were like. Later, some folks in English started comparing the schools in different colonies and lookin' closer at specific parts of them. They found that each colony was different, just like I said.\n\nOne guy, Cohen, wrote a whole book about schools in South West Africa and East Africa. He compared them and figured out why they were so different. He thinks the big population of white folks in South Africa had a lot to do with it.\n\nSouth West Africa wasn't as hot and humid as some of the other German colonies, although it was pretty dry and desert-y.  That meant more white folks wanted to live there. By 1913, almost 15,000 white folks lived there, compared to only 5,000 in East Africa, which was the next most populated colony.",
            "Yo, check it!  Music's gone wild over the last 100 years, man. So many styles now, it's a freakin' jungle out there. You got your rock, your rap, your country, your jazz, your folk, and then, bam! Sub-genres popping up like mushrooms after a rainstorm. \n\nBut hold up, let's talk about Heavy Metal, the real deal. It's been shredding faces for 40 years, and it's like a whole universe of its own. It's all about those dark vibes, ya know? Anger, angst, the whole nine yards. But it's also super diverse, man. People took that heavy sound and twisted it into a million different directions. Sub-genres upon sub-genres, it's like a never-ending game of musical chairs.\n\nNow, it's so crazy out there in metal land, it's hard to say what even defines it anymore. It's borrowed from everywhere, but it all started somewhere, right?  To get the full picture, you gotta understand what metal's REALLY about, why it's a movement, not just a genre. \n\nMetal's all about that darkness, man. It's like a sonic scream into the void. More bass, more volume, more intensity, more everything! It's like a big middle finger to the mainstream.  Metalheads are serious musicians too, they're all about chops and skill. And let's be real, drugs have always been a big part of the scene. Back in the 70s, those psychedelic trips fueled some seriously wild music. It's all about pushing boundaries, man, exploring the dark side of life,  and letting those emotions flow.\n\nEven those old Romantic poets, they knew about that darkness, and metal bands have definitely picked up on that vibe. Lyrics like these:\n\n[Insert lyrics here]\n\nSee, that's the heart of metal. It's raw, it's honest, it's unapologetically dark.",
            "Alright, picture this: way before those fancy Surrealist dudes started painting their crazy dreams, there was this artist named Henri Rousseau, and he was busy dreamin' up his own world, both on canvas and in his head. One of his paintings, called \"The Dream,\" shows a lady checkin' out some wild stuff in a dreamland. But get this, it's not just about the dream, it's about Rousseau's own dreams, ya know? He wanted to be famous, to have other artists and art lovers dig his stuff. But here's the catch: he had this big struggle goin' on inside him. Should he paint like everyone else to fit in with the fancy art crowd, or should he just do his own thing and be different? \"The Dream\" kinda sums up this whole dilemma he had.\n\nBefore we dive deeper, let me tell ya a bit about this guy Rousseau. Born way back in 1844, he wasn't some rich art kid. His dad was a hardware guy, and Rousseau worked for the government collectin' tolls for years. He never went to art school, not even once! He was like, forty years old before he decided to paint. Even worse, his first wife and most of his kids died, so he was heartbroken. Painting became his escape, his way to start fresh.  \n\nSo, Rousseau wanted to be a big shot in the art world, and it makes sense why. He was a late bloomer, didn't have any fancy training, and all these other talented artists were gettin' all the attention.  He was tryin' hard, but folks weren't really seein' what he was doin'.  It wasn't until Matisse started makin' a name for himself that Rousseau finally started gettin' some recognition.  This guy Gordon, who wrote a book about French painters, said that Rousseau and Matisse were different in every way. Matisse was all about bein' unique, while Rousseau just wanted to paint something so classic that the art world would finally accept him.",
            "So, like, a bunch of really smart peeps think that  being good and looking good are totally connected, ya know? Like, they're like besties.  It's like what Keats said in his poem about that fancy old urn: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That's all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn a lot from school and stuff, but we just *get* good and good-looking stuff without anyone telling us, ya know? Both good stuff and pretty stuff are all about explaining why something is good or pretty, not like, making rules for how to be good or make pretty things.\n\nThink about it, when someone's all, \"This painting is amazing!\" they can talk about stuff like colors and stuff, but it's still not the whole story. It's like, \"There's just something about it!\"  \n\nLike, even when we try to explain why something's good,  it's like, there's this extra somethin' somethin' we can't quite put our finger on. It's like O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\"\n\nEthics and art, they both have this extra somethin' somethin' that makes them super powerful. It's like a vibe, ya know? Like, we feel it in our gut, but can't explain it with words.\n\nAnd books, man, they're even more intense because they're all about values, like, what's important in life.  McKean said it best: \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\"",
            "Germany today is a real powerhouse, a country united with its own unique culture. It's like, picture this: you've got Munich, all high-tech and fancy in the Bavarian Alps, and then you got Kiel by the Baltic Sea, chillin' with its own vibe.  It's the same kinda cool feeling you get from Cologne on the Rhine River, all the way through the middle of Germany to Dresden, that fancy city on the Elbe. With so much going on, it's no wonder Germany's culture is a mix of everything, a melting pot from different tribes and stuff. \n\nBack in the day, this land was called Germania, and where the name came from? Well, that's a whole mystery! Some say this dude Tacitus, a history guy, thought it came from a tribe called the Tungrians, who were, like, the OG Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought with Gaulish dudes. Julius Caesar, the Roman guy who conquered Gaul, was the first to use the word \"Germanus\" to talk about the tribes he didn't conquer, like, \"those guys are Germans, they're different from the Gauls I beat.\" Some think it came from the Gauls themselves, kinda like a label to say \"these guys are not us!\"  Others think it came from their spears, called \"ger,\" or maybe from the old Irish word \"garim\" which means \"to shout,\" 'cause, you know, Germans were loud!\n\nTacitus, the Roman dude from way back, wrote this book called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" in 98 AD, all about where the Germans came from. He said that they were like, the original inhabitants, not mixed with anyone else. He thought nobody in their right mind would leave Asia or Africa for Germany, unless, like, it was their home!\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Not a chance! The Romans would send out their troops to get stuff and wage war, but they mostly stayed in their big empire.  But those Germanic tribes kept popping up, living on the borders of the Roman Empire. They traded their goods and even served in the Roman army, which was pretty cool.",
            "Down there, the porcelain throne stared back at me.  My brain, man, it was just... vacant.  Like, I saw the mess, but it wasn't really *seeing* it, ya know?  Thoughts popped up, like bubbles in a murky pond, then vanished just as fast.  It was like watching a movie,  but I wasn't really in it.\n\nSo, I got this book once, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  Always wanted to draw, since I was a kid.  This book, it's all about how your brain  sees stuff, you know,  like,  how a pencil is more than just a stick.  One trick it teaches is to put a square around whatever you're looking at.  Like, if you're looking at a bowl of fruit, bam!  Square.  Suddenly it's not this giant, overwhelming thing, just the bowl of fruit.\n\nBut here I was, staring at this...thing...and I couldn't even mentally put that square down.  I was  mesmerized, man.  Picasso had his blue phase, Monet loved his greens, those Renaissance guys, they were all about the color explosion.  Me?  I was staring at my own brown masterpiece.   \n\nMy hand hovered over the toilet brush, muscles tense, ready to strike.  It was like the start of a masterpiece, you know?  Water swirling, smooth and clear,  little bits of...stuff...floating away.  But then, my hand jerked, panicked.  The thing wouldn't budge.  Stuck fast, like a bad dream.\n\nMop in one hand, tie choking me out, I glared at the brown mess. Someone's \"art project.\"  A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet contemplation, then I reached for the toilet paper.  Wrapped it around my hand like a freaking oven mitt.  Straight up, then bent over, my hand dipped into the bowl.  Like a mom checking the turkey, except way less delicious.",
            "Yo! So, get this, teenagers are like, totally crashing their cars left and right. It's like, a major bummer, you know? Apparently, their brains ain't fully cooked yet for all the crazy stuff that happens on the road. Plus, they're like, super inexperienced.  Think about it: they're more likely to, like, smash their cars, flip 'em over, zoom way too fast, or even drive right off the road!\n\nAnd get this, things get even worse when they've got their buddies in the car. Like, duh, that's what they do, right? But seriously, it makes stuff way more dangerous. Some brainiacs in California figured this out, and they're all, \"Hey, maybe we should make things harder for teens to drive.\" So, they came up with this thing called a \"provisional license\" – basically, limited driving hours and no passengers under a certain age. Sounds kinda lame, right?\n\nBut here's the deal: It ain't really solving the problem.  This one psychologist dude, Marvin Zuckerman, says even 18 is too young to be driving because teens just crave that adrenaline rush, ya know?  They're all about taking risks for the thrill.  So, maybe we should just wait a few more years until they chill out a bit before they get behind the wheel. \n\nIf we keep letting teens drive, it's gonna be a real mess.  Like, a whole lot of accidents and people getting hurt.  It's not gonna be pretty, especially with all those baby boomers' kids hitting the road soon.\n\nWe need to do something about it, man!  Schools can still teach 'em how to drive, but no one under 18 should be allowed on the road.  They can get a temporary permit and practice with an adult, but no solo driving until they're older.\n\nIt's gotta be a national thing, too, so everyone's on the same page. It's not rocket science, right?",
            "So, I was checking out all these old Edison films at the Library of Congress. You know, those super early ones? I found fifteen trick films from way back when, between 1895 and 1901.  These films are all about using clever editing to pull off crazy illusions. I mainly looked at how they did that in most of the films and  noticed a few that were a little different, pushing the boundaries.\n\nMost of these trick films were pretty basic. They stuck to the same setup every time: a stage-like set, the camera just hanging out in one spot, no fancy camera moves, and long shots, like you're looking at a whole scene at once. They also stuck to this rule: one shot, one film.  No messing around with cutting between different shots.\n\nBut then, there were a few films that started to sneak in some stuff like multiple shots, which was pretty wild for the time!  \n\nOne thing all these films had in common was this set-up. Imagine a stage with a curtain at the front. That's basically what these films looked like. The camera wouldn't move, it just stayed put, like a front-row seat at a show. This was super common back then, especially for magic shows and vaudeville. The problem was, because they were stuck in this \"stage\" setup, the actors could only move side to side, never towards or away from the camera. Like in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), the actors walk back and forth across the screen, but the camera never follows them.\n\nBecause of this stage-like setup, the shots were always long or medium shots.  No close-ups, ever! This came from the theatre and vaudeville, where the audience wanted to see the whole thing at once.  Since the actors never walked towards the camera, there was no need for close-ups.\n\nAnd get this, most of these trick films stuck to one idea per film. It meant they were really short, like just a minute or less. They couldn't tell a much of a story because they were so short. They were more like little vaudeville acts, with magic tricks, disappearing stuff, and switching things around. But here's the thing: what looked like one shot to us, might actually be several shots put together to make the magic happen, like in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895). If you look really closely, you'll see where they switched shots to make it look like her head was chopped off!",
            "Alright, so there's this dude, John Taylor, from Caroline. This guy was all about the whole \"Republican\" thing, ya know, back in the day.  He mostly did farming stuff, but even that, plus his little stint in politics, made him a real loudmouth when it came to freedom and stuff.\n\nSee, Taylor was all about farms.  He thought farming was the best job ever, and that's what made him think the way he did about the government. He wanted to keep farms strong, and that's why he got so worked up about how the government worked, like the Constitution and even the courts.\n\nThis guy thought America had a shot at making things perfect, 'cause there wasn't any old tradition messing things up. He thought we could make our own rules, ya know, do our own thing.  He believed everyone had rights, like, super important rights, and if one was messed with, they all were, see? He thought the government shouldn't mess with those rights at all. He was like, \"Man's natural state\" means the strong guys are the ones who win, but in a society, that ain't right.\"\n\nTo make this perfect society, Taylor thought the government had to be built to understand that people are good and bad at the same time. He was super strict about this idea of good and evil. He said, \"Government is run by humans, so it's gotta have both good and bad parts.\" He thought good stuff meant protecting your stuff, making farming better, and not liking capitalism too much.  He figured a good government would work fair no matter who was running it, 'cause everyone's greedy anyway.  He saw greed as normal, but bad when it meant making a bunch of groups that hurt each other.  A good government was needed to keep the bad stuff in check, but even then, had to be watched close so it didn't get worse.\n\nLike a lot of Republicans back then, Taylor thought the Constitution should be followed exactly as it was written. He wanted a government that didn't have much power, only what was in the Constitution. He knew a big government was expensive and could be a real pain. But he didn't think just reading the words was enough, you had to know what the guys who wrote it *meant.* He even thought the Declaration of Independence was more important, 'cause it said America was a bunch of states, not one big country.",
            "Alright, so check this out. We had this thing going where people logged their commutes, right? Figure 17 shows that things went *totally* downhill in month three. Kind of bummed us out, gotta be honest. We figured maybe it was the weather. Winter hit hard in New England, and who wants to bike or walk when it's freezing? Plus, December is crazy busy for everyone at college - finals, grades, the whole shebang.  Maybe the log thing just got lost in the shuffle. Then there's the holidays, with everyone gone for a month. School's back in session in January, but still, not a lot of logs. February was a mystery, though.  \n\nMaybe at first everyone was all hyped up about the project, and then things just fizzled out. To get things rolling again, we did this \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, and it actually worked! More people started logging their commutes. But the lesson was clear: keeping people engaged is tough, especially with all the breaks and stuff that happen in college.\n\nAnother big thing? People *love* their cars. It's like a national obsession. So, we had to bribe them with prizes! Gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, even massages. We thought it was pretty sweet, but maybe we should've gone bigger - like a fancy bike, a hybrid car, even an electric one! Think that would've brought in more people.\n\nWe kept the same prizes throughout the whole project. Maybe changing things up would've helped. Imagine if we announced at the start of December that we'd give away a couple bikes, and then in January, a hybrid or electric car! I bet we'd see a ton more people logging their commutes.",
            "Alright, lemme break this down for ya.  See, these things called ETFs are like supercharged index funds. They track stuff like stocks or even whole markets, but you can buy and sell 'em just like regular stock, ya know?  It's like the best of both worlds, but lemme tell ya, there's a catch. \n\nThese ETFs, they cost less to run than those index funds, but ya gotta pay a fee every time ya buy or sell 'em. Kinda like payin' a toll road, except instead of a bridge, it's your money.  But hey, the good news is, there's a ton of different ETFs out there, so you can find one that fits your style.\n\nNow, some smart folks like to check if these ETFs really do what they say they do.  Like, let's say there's this ETF called IHF.  It's got a bunch of stocks inside, but what if those stocks ain't doin' so hot?  Could be better off just buyin' those stocks straight up, ya know? \n\nSo, what these brainiacs did was they took a look at IHF's top ten stocks, the ones that make up most of the ETF. They figured if those ten stocks are doin' well, then the whole ETF should be doin' well too.  And guess what?  They found out that just buyin' those ten stocks might actually give ya a better return, and even less risk!\n\nBut wait, there's more! They also checked if the risk level, called Beta, was the same for the ETF and the ten stocks.  Turns out, the ten stocks were a little less risky.\n\nSo, it looks like sometimes you might be better off just pickin' your own stocks instead of usin' an ETF.  But hey, that's just one story.  Gotta do your own research, ya know?",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this poem \"Dream-Land\" by Edgar Allan Poe, a real head-scratcher. Poe talks about this place called \"Thule\" twice, and it's got a whole history. Turns out, some dude named Virgil used it first, back in the day, to describe a place way up north, like the end of the world, ya know? But get this, Poe was a big fan of German authors, especially this guy Goethe. Now, Goethe had a poem called \"The King of Thulé\" about this sad king who loses his wife and goes on a downward spiral, drinking and grieving 'til he finally kicks the bucket.  Sounds kinda familiar to Poe's style, right?  It's like Poe took that whole vibe and threw it into \"Dream-Land\". Poe even uses \"Thule\" as a bookend in \"Dream-Land\", like he's putting a stamp on it. Kinda makes ya wonder if Poe was taking inspiration from Goethe, ya know?  Poe was smart, he knew his stuff, and he loved to play with ideas. Plus, Goethe was a big deal back then, everyone was talking about him, so Poe probably picked it up somehow. It's like a little secret message for all the smart folks who know their literature.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this lady, Jennifer Palmer. She took a spill in a grocery store, tripped on some spilled applesauce, and went 'boom' - busted back! Now, she's sayin' the store manager, this dude Martin, shoulda known better 'cause folks had been slipping on stuff all over the place. She's talkin' about suein' for some extra cash, not just for her busted back, but 'cause she thinks Martin was bein' a real jerk about it all.\n\nSee, Martin got told twice about the applesauce mess, but he was too busy stuffin' his face with dinner, he says. \"Nah, I ain't got time for customer complaints,\" he says. So, an hour later, Jennifer comes along, slips, and BAM! Injury city.\n\nNow, in California, ya can get extra dough if ya prove someone was bein' a real jerk, like they meant to hurt ya or were willfully ignorin' that their mess could hurt someone. Jennifer's sayin' Martin totally knew people were gettin' hurt from these spills, but he didn't care. He's basically sayin', \"Let 'em slip, I got my dinner!\"\n\nThe judge ain't gonna throw the case out just yet. Jennifer's got some points, 'specially since this ain't the first time this kinda thing happened.  But whether she can prove Martin was bein' a total jerk, that's another story.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this Islam class I took ages ago. We were all huffing and puffing about whether Islam was, ya know, a bad religion or not.  Still think it's a head-scratcher, especially after 9/11, ya know? \n\nThe news went from totally bashing Islam to, like, kissing its feet.  Can you believe it? We'd never see a dude named Barack Obama running for president back then, especially with that Muslim family history of his. \n\nThis Muhammad dude's story is kinda messed up, too. I thought he was all about force-feeding Islam down people's throats, conquering tribes and making 'em convert. But this book paints him as a, get this, martyr! Misunderstood, humble, the whole nine yards. People just flocked to him, seein' the light and all. Sounds fishy, right?\n\nAnd get this, there's some crazy similarities between Jesus and Muhammad.  Like this one time Muhammad turned mutton and milk into a whole feast for forty guys!  They're trying to make Muhammad look like a humble prophet, like he didn't need to prove anything, just living his truth and whatnot.  It's bogus, man, it totally downplays Jesus' awesomeness.\n\nThere's also all these stories about how people converted to Islam on their own, but they're all secondhand, like whispers down a hallway.  Someone told someone who told someone else.  It's not exactly solid proof, if you ask me.\n\nThe whole thing just feels like they're trying to elevate Muhammad, make him out to be some godly dude.  But history says he was more of a power-hungry dude, and it makes me wonder if Muslims today even know the real story behind his rise to the top.",
            "Hold on to your hats, folks, 'cause things are about to get wild in the world of Christianity! It's like this: Jesus dropped some serious knowledge bombs back in the day, but after he bounced, things got kinda... messy.  Think of it like a game of telephone, where the message gets twisted with every retelling.  Now, the world's getting woke and progressive faster than a cheetah on espresso.  The old-timers might grumble and cling to their dusty teachings, but they ain't gonna stop the tide.  \n\nGet this: Christians are gonna start digging deep into their history, like archaeologists unearthing a lost treasure.  They'll be like, \"Hold up a sec, what exactly did Jesus actually teach?\" and they'll peel back all those layers of extra stuff that got added over the years.  It might take a while, maybe even a few centuries, but lemme tell ya, it's gonna happen.  It's like rewinding time on a clock, going back to the good ol' days when it was all about Jesus and his message.\n\nWhen this wave hits America and Europe, churches will be packed, but with a twist.  Instead of a million different flavors of Christianity, everyone will be singing from the same hymn book.  Think of it like a big, happy family reunion where everyone's finally getting along.  History's full of these crazy reversals, like how the Romans turned from persecuting Christians to becoming Christians themselves.  And remember how America used to have slavery, but now? Well, African Americans are leading the charge!\n\nSo, get ready for a major shake-up in the Christian world.  It'll start with people realizing that Jesus' words are more like metaphors than a rulebook.  And then, boom!  Back to basics.  \n\nNow, let's rewind back to the beginning, to those early days of Judaism, the root of the whole Christian thing.  Back then, it was all about one God, divine messages, and those ancient Hebrew scriptures.  But even then, there were different groups, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and Zealots.",
            "Man, this book, *The Jungle*, it's like lookin' at a whole city just full of jerks. You know, the kinda guys who think the world revolves around 'em. Like these factory bosses, they're all about makin' their money, makin' their factories bigger, louder, and smokier. They don't care about the workers, they don't care about the air they're pollutin', they just wanna see those profits roll in. This one part, it says the buildings are \"clear-cut and black against the sky\" and the smoke's just streamin' out forever. It's like they're tryin' to choke the whole thing, you know?\n\nAnd get this, these bosses, they don't even think twice before tossin' workers aside like yesterday's news.  They make 'em work crazy hours, then bam! Layoffs! No warning, no help, nothin'. It's like they're sayin', \"Tough luck, pal, find another gig!\" You see, back then, there weren't any rules to protect the workers.  It was a free-for-all, and these bosses, they were like wild animals.\n\nThe book even says it straight up: the workers are just slaves.  No rights, no power, just stuck in this awful system. They're treated worse than dirt, and there's no one to help 'em. Unions try to step in, but they just end up makin' things worse, takin' money from the people they're supposed to be helpin'.

            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this author dude, F. Scott Fitzgerald. He's got this knack for makin' ya feel things, ya know? He uses all sorts of tricks to do it, some work better than others.  Take his book, *The Great Gatsby*, for example. He likes to throw together words that don't usually hang out together, like two random dudes at a party. That throws ya off, makes ya think.  He also loves to use symbols, like colors, to make ya feel somethin' special.  He's got this thing for gold, green, white and gray, and red and pink. He builds up this whole vibe around these colors, then BAM! He uses 'em to make ya remember somethin' important, somethin' that'll stick with ya.\n\nTake white and gray, for instance. He makes 'em mean somethin' special, see? White is kinda fancy, like someone rich wearin' a crisp white shirt. Gray, on the other hand, is older, faded, like somethin' that's been around the block a few times. He starts throwin' these colors around from the get-go. Daisy and Jordan are always in white, everyone's wearin' white, like it's the only color that matters. Even Nick, when he's at Gatsby's party, he's rockin' white flannels. It's like a white takeover!  \n\nThen, bam, Fitzgerald throws in some gray. He describes the names on Nick's timetable as \"gray names,\" like they're nothin' special. He says Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" all uniform and boring.  Even the people are white or gray – Daisy and Jordan had a \"white girlhood,\" there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes. It's like he's sayin' that these things, these people, they're just part of the background, nothin' special.\n\nSo, what's his point? Well, he starts usin' these colors to make us feel somethin' about Daisy. After a while, he describes her in white again, like she's just another piece of the puzzle, somethin' Gatsby wants. He even says she's got a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar,\" like she's lost in the fog of it all. \n\nFitzgerald's really good at usin' colors to talk about things that are important, and he does it in a way that makes ya feel somethin' deep down.",
            "Man, San Diego is like, totally ripe for growing stuff, ya know? It's all sunny and cozy there. They grow this crazy amount of tomatoes, citrus, greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. It's crazy! And get this, there are tons of people who are all about that organic life, like, seriously, they're willing to wait forever for their veggies. They're even nuts for organic eggs and milk! \n\nA lot of these farms give tours, too, and you can even go hiking and birdwatching there. It's like, a win-win! You get to help the environment, make some cash, and teach people about farming. \n\nNow, organic farming is cool and all, but it can be tough. You gotta work way harder to keep the bugs and weeds away without those nasty chemicals. It's like, a full-time job! And sometimes, you lose more stuff than you would with regular farming. But hey, it's good for the planet, right?\n\nSpeaking of the planet, did you know there's this place near Potrero called, like, Chaparral or something? It's got all this stuff like oak trees and grasslands, and it's right next to this giant forest. They're even worried about all these endangered animals living there, like kangaroo rats and frogs and butterflies. \n\nThis land has been around forever, man. Native Americans lived there for ages, then some ranchers came along and started raising cattle. Now, this one dude wants to start an organic farm there, but he needs some help. He's gotta make money, take care of the animals, and keep the government happy. It's a lot to handle!",
            "Alright, so listen up! This whole culture thing is a big deal when you're trying to, you know, get stuff done with other peeps. See, culture ain't just one thing, it's like a whole bag of mixed nuts, ya know? You can't just say \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are chill\" 'cause that's just dumb.  Sure, there are some general ideas about different cultures, but to really get somewhere, you gotta figure out what makes that culture tick.  Like, how do they think, what's important to them, and how will that play out when you're haggling?  \n\nWhen you're meeting people from a different place, you're gonna compare 'em to your own crew, it's natural. But instead of judging 'em, just try to understand where they're coming from. You gotta play by their rules, especially if you're the one not holding all the cards.  Respect their stuff, their ways, their traditions, you know? It'll make things go smoother.\n\nAnd hey, culture ain't just about countries, it's about companies too! Some places are all about long hours and serious business, while others are more laid-back.  Look at how people dress, how they talk, who's in charge, and how they hire folks.  Even in America, places are different! It's like a whole other world sometimes.  \n\nNow, values are the real secret sauce. They're the \"why\" behind the culture. If a place values saving face, you better not go around embarrassing your boss to win a deal.  And if they're all about hard bargaining, don't expect them to back down easy.  You gotta figure this stuff out before you even show up at the table. But hey, don't forget to get to know the people you're dealing with on a personal level too.  That's how you really make a connection and get things done.",
            "So, lemme tell ya about these two dudes, Anselm and Aquinas. They both thought God was the real deal, like, totally, and they both tried to prove it. But they went about it in different ways. Anselm was all about lookin' inside yourself, sayin' that God's gotta exist 'cause ya know it in your bones, like it's just plain true. It's kinda like faith, ya know? You gotta believe it even if you can't see it. \n\nAquinas, on the other hand, was more of a \"show me the proof\" kinda guy. He said we could figure out God exists by lookin' at the world around us, like seein' how things work and how everything's connected. He had these five big ideas, kinda like puzzle pieces, that all fit together to show that God's gotta be there.\n\nNow, both of these guys made some good points, but neither of 'em really blew my mind. It's like, they both had parts of the puzzle, but they weren't quite picture-perfect. You gotta figure out the rest for yourself, ya know?",
            "Whoa, dude! So this dude, Buddha, was born like, way back in the day, like the fifth or sixth century BCE.  He was a prince, but then he ditched all that fancy stuff and went all zen, ya know? He figured out how to escape the crazy cycle of life, death, and rebirth, and his peeps started calling him Buddha, which means \"the awakened one.\" His teachings, they blew everyone's minds and became this big thing called Buddhism. There's this group, the Theravada Buddhists, they're like the OG Buddhists, and they've been around for like, 2,500 years.  \n\nBut get this, Buddhism ain't exactly the same as it was back then. Like, in Sri Lanka, these guys have this crazy water-cutting ceremony, and it's a big deal, but Buddha never mentioned anything about it!  See, over time, Buddhism has changed a lot, from little things like traditions to, like, the big ideas that make up the whole religion.\n\nThink of it like this: Buddhism is like a cool band, right? They started out with a killer sound, but over the years, they've added new instruments, changed some songs, maybe even got a new bass player. It's still the same band, but it's evolved!\n\nSo, to understand this whole thing, we gotta talk about some important words: \"internal forces\" and \"external forces.\"  Internal means stuff that comes from inside the Buddhist community, like monks and lay people. External means anything from, like, outside the church. Now, \"hostile\" forces are like, bad vibes, they try to mess up Buddhism. Benign forces, they don't really care about Buddhism, but sometimes they end up helping or hurting it accidentally.\n\nNow, let's get to the heart of Theravada Buddhism. They believe in the \"Triple Gem\": Buddha, the teachings (the Dhamma), and the community (the Sangha). The Dhamma is like the Buddhist rulebook, it's got all these scriptures called the Tripitaka. It's got stories, rules, and deep philosophical stuff. They talk about Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (life is suffering), and Anicca (everything changes).  \n\nThe whole idea is, if you understand these things, you can escape the cycle of death and rebirth (Sansara) and get rid of desire, hatred, and delusion.  Then, bam! You're enlightened!",
            "'So, you know how Mack keeps sending these crazy robot things after us?' I said, 'Well, lemme tell ya, the US and Mexico kinda did that thing, but with, like, war and stuff. Back in the day, like 1836 to 1893, they were at each other's throats for a solid 57 years! It was intense, man. Like, they fought a whole war, the Mexican-American War, and the US basically took over Texas and the Southwest. Talk about a bad breakup! \n\nSee, they were clashing over all sorts of stuff - religion, culture, you name it. Plus, they both wanted the same land. Kinda like how we're always arguing over who gets the last slice of pizza, but, y'know, on a national level.\n\nIt's not just the US and Mexico, though. Lots of countries that are neighbors have this \"we're better than you\" thing going on. Makes ya wonder, right? \n\nAnyway, the US and Mexico, they were like the ultimate frenemies.  This guy, David Pletcher, said that the US had major problems with Mexico and Cuba, and they were the only ones who really messed with America.  \n\nReligion was a big deal, too. Like, the US was all about \"we do things our way,\" and Mexico was like, \"nah, we got our own thing going on.\" It's kinda like how Cybe and B.B. always argue about video games.\n\nThe whole thing started way back when, with the English and Spanish getting into it.  That kinda messed things up for the US and Mexico from the start.\n\nThey had tons of fights over land and stuff.  It was like a never-ending game of tag, but with guns.  Finally, though, things started to cool down. Mexico needed the US for stuff, and the US realized that taking over more land wasn't the best idea.",
            "Fifteen years ago, boom! This illness I never even knew existed hit me outta nowhere. I was a nurse, ya know?  Always figured it was the safe bet, like my folks told me. \"You'll always have a job, folks always get sick.\" So I went with it, even though my heart was set on science or maybe journalism, heck, both woulda been awesome. But here I am, 46, single, broke, and can't even work. And it's not like it's gonna get better anytime soon. Fifteen years on disability and I've got zip, nada, nothin' left that's really mine.\n\nEvery day is a struggle. It's a punch to the gut, man, to my security, my safety, my whole self-worth.  Nothing's certain anymore, except this: I wouldn't have made it through all this without my family and a few good friends, even though sometimes I feel like a total weakling. 'Cause when disaster strikes, you realize just how weak you really are. \n\nLife throws curveballs, big and small. No matter how much you plan, some stuff just knocks you down.  We gotta stop putting all our faith in the big government, 'cause that ship's sunk, let's be real. \n\nInstead, we gotta learn to trust each other again.  Help each other out, get comfortable asking for help.  We're better off as a pack, not a bunch of loners building their own little fallout shelters. \n\nThose conservatives talk about \"rugged individualism,\" but back in the day, the pioneers didn't make it across the country alone. They made it because they had compassion, respect for each other, and they shared what they had. \n\nSo yeah, be prepared. I am. Got my disaster kit, first aid, water purification, duct tape for the windows, the whole shebang. Flashlights, batteries, candles, canned goods.

            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this crazy thing called evolution! \n\nSo, scientists have been trying to figure out how critters change over time, like how a plain ol' snail shell turns into a crazy spiral. Back in the day, some dude named D'Arcy Thompson said it was like trying to describe a snowflake with math - tough, right?  Well, nowadays, they're using math to try and figure out how shells grow and change. Think of it like building a shell with math equations!\n\nThese guys took pictures of snail shells and used fancy computer programs to see how different shapes could grow. They're even doing experiments to see how these shapes actually happen. It's like a detective story, trying to figure out the secrets of shell evolution!\n\nSo, imagine a snail's shell like a long, twisty tube. Each twist is called a whorl, and they all spiral around a line called the columella. The shell grows bigger as it goes, and you can see the lines between each whorl called sutures. \n\nNow, there are all sorts of ways to look at a shell - from the top (apical view), the bottom (basal view), the opening (apertural view), and the opposite of that (abapertural view). \n\nThey even have a trick for counting how many whorls there are. You gotta look at the shell from the top and find the first suture. Draw a line down the middle and count the whorls on each side.\n\nThink of it like the snail building its shell one tiny piece at a time. Each piece is like a little door (aperture), and they all stack up in a special way.  They can even use math to see how these doors move and change shape over time. It's wild, right?",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this thing called 'child health' in Indonesia. It ain't lookin' too hot, ya know? For the last ten years, the little ones ain't been doin' so well. Now, Indonesia's got some good stuff goin' on, like clean water and fancy toilets, but when it comes to keepin' babies and moms healthy, they're fallin' behind. We talkin' serious short comin's here!\n\nThey're tryin' to get more folks with fancy medical degrees at birth, which is cool, but some of these 'skilled workers' are just midwives, and when things get hairy, they ain't exactly equipped to handle it. So yeah, that fancy number might look good, but it ain't tellin' the whole story. And guess what? Less kids with tummy aches are seein' a doctor now, which ain't exactly a great sign. \n\nEven gettin' help after the baby's born is a mess. They ain't got enough doctors for that, either. And get this - they ain't doin' enough c-sections, especially out in the sticks. It's like the city folks get all the good stuff, while the poor folks are stuck with nothin'. That ain't right, man! \n\nSo, what's the answer? Should they just focus on one little problem at a time, or should they beef up the whole healthcare system? That's a tough one. \n\nSee, focusin' on one problem is like throwin' a bandaid on a gash. It might stop the bleedin' for a bit, but it ain't gonna fix the whole thing. And if you keep throwin' bandaids on every little thing, you're gonna end up with a whole lotta bandaids and a whole lotta problems.",
            "Alright, so get this: Victorian books are all about being super detailed and talking about fancy folks. But then there's these two books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" that are like, \"Nah, we're gonna do things differently.\" \n\nThese books are all about mystery and weird stuff, which wasn't really a thing in most Victorian books. And that makes the characters way more interesting! It gives you a peek into their heads and why they do the stuff they do.\n\nLike, take this part from \"Oliver Twist\":\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n\nSee, Oliver's having these crazy visions, like dreams or something. He's confused and scared, and it shows us how messed up he feels inside.\n\nBoth \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" use these dream-like scenes to show us what's going on in the characters' minds. In \"Oliver Twist,\" they show us Oliver's pain and how he's starting to understand the world around him. When he gets shot, he relives it over and over in his head, like a bad dream. It shows us how much pain he's in and how helpless he feels.\n\nThe shooting makes you wonder who's really in control, because it's definitely not Oliver.  He's like a puppet, just going along for the ride.  It's like Fagin is breaking him down, making him give up and accept his fate.\n\n\nAnd here's another example from \"Wuthering Heights\"...\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "Couple years back, I was helping out at this after-school program, you know, tutoring those little elementary kids. I was pretty good at English and reading, so that's what I mostly did.  But then this little dude, Adrian, probably in third or fourth grade, came along. He was struggling to read, real bad.  It was weird, though. He'd nail some letters perfectly, then totally botch others.  Made no sense! He spoke perfect English, but something was off.  We were stuck in a rut until one day Adrian's mom came to pick him up.  I'm talking full-on Spanish speaker, zero English.  We managed to make sense of things with my rusty Spanish skills (I was just starting to learn, you know).  And then it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read, just not the English alphabet real well.  I don't know if it helped in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nSee, that story is all about the language barrier in schools, especially here in California.  It shows you that things aren't always as obvious as they seem.  Even if a kid speaks English perfectly, reading it can still be a real pain.  Everyone knows this is a problem, right? So what do we do about it? \n\nFor Adrian, it was simple:  tutoring him in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated.  There's no one magic bullet.  Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes – none of them are the answer on their own.  We gotta combine them all!\n\nDual language programs are a great idea, not just for Spanish speakers, but for everyone!  \"Kids in these programs actually do better in school,\" you know?  There's a lot of fear about them, like they waste resources and don't benefit most kids.  But that's just wrong. If we made them the norm instead of the exception, everyone would win. \n\nHow do we do that? Do we make all teachers bilingual? Nah, that's crazy talk. But we can totally have bilingual helpers, tutors, whatever you want to call them.",
            "Okay, so like, everyone's always talkin' about some big somethin' out there, right?  Some kinda super-duper somethin' bigger than us, bigger than our whole heads can even wrap around. Some folks go to church or temple or whatever to figure it out, but some of us are all, \"Nah, man, there's nothin' beyond me and my own little world.\"  We might believe in one thing for a while, then bam!  We change our minds and find somethin' else.  It's all about findin' our own way, you know?  Like, we're all searchin' for a freakin' light in the dark, somethin' to guide us outta the shadows and into the sunshine.\n\nMy dad, he was a smoker. We'd sit on the porch, rain poundin' on the roof like a drum solo, and just puff away.  He was lookin' kinda thin, clothes saggin' on him, hair like a bad wig.  He'd stare out at the rain, kinda lost in thought.  I wanted to talk to him, but I was scared.  Scared to say what I was thinkin', scared of makin' it all real.  So I just hugged him, sat closer, and stared at the rain with him.\n\nMy dad, he kicked the bucket in December, a few days after my 22nd birthday.  The chemo and all that stuff didn't really help, just kept him around longer than the doctors thought.  I dunno, what was the point of that?  What kinda jerk God would do that?  Honestly, I didn't pray.  If there was a God out there, He'd stopped listenin' to me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't wanna watch him die.  Couldn't watch the guy who made me disappear.  I wanted to remember him for how he lived, not how he died.  I knew him better than anyone, better than even his family.  I knew he wouldn't want me sittin' there like a creep, watchin' him die.  So I just curled up in bed for three days, waitin' for the news.\n\nNo one even had the decency to call.",
            "Alright, listen up! The whole \"Gothic Novel\" thing is kinda whack, ya know? Like, it's called \"Gothic\" but it's all about this old-timey stuff mixed with somethin' new. This dude, Ian Watt,  said it best: a real oxymoron, like \"jumbo shrimp\"! Some folks think it's garbage, others think it's deep as the ocean. They've called it everything from boring to totally awesome for how creepy it gets.  \n\nSo, this first \"Gothic Novel,\"  *The Castle of Otranto* by Horace Walpole,  it's like the OG of the whole shebang. It takes those old-school stories, like the ones from ancient times, and mixes 'em with the newfangled way of writing novels, ya dig?  Walpole throws in some stage stuff and tries to make it all sound real life-like. He calls it a \"Gothic Story,\" and it's all about castles and spooky stuff. \n\nBack then,  \"Gothic\" meant all sorts of things -  like,  people, styles, even time periods. It was kinda like saying \"old-fashioned\" or \"not cool\" compared to the new, modern stuff. But here's the kicker: combining that \"Gothic\" vibe with the new way of writing novels, where you get inside the characters' heads,  that's what keeps it going for so long. It's like, both old and new at the same time!\n\nOne big thing in Gothic stories is **Chivalry**.  Remember those knights in shining armor?  Well, Gothic writers loved that idea. It was all about being brave, honorable, and a total badass.  But they also thought that real life wasn't like that anymore.  So they used chivalric stuff, like knights and castles, to make the past seem better than the present. \n\nWalpole wrote *The Castle of Otranto* during a time when things were kinda messed up politically. He was worried about the future and thought maybe people weren't as good as they used to be. In his story, you see this idea with a character named Frederic.  He's described as a prince who's been through some tough stuff and is supposed to be dead.  He's basically the perfect knight, but he's also a bit over-the-top, which is kinda hilarious.  It's like, he's the ideal knight, but taken to the extreme.",
            "Alright, check it out, cuz this is how the whole supply chain thing works! It's like a crazy rollercoaster ride for stuff, from the moment someone wants somethin' to when it finally lands in their hands. Back in '82, this dude named Keith Oliver came up with the fancy name \"supply chain management.\" He was basically sayin', \"Yo, we gotta plan this whole shebang - makin' the stuff, gettin' the stuff, movin' the stuff - to make sure everyone's happy and gettin' what they need, like, yesterday!\" \n\nSo, there are these six key players in this whole supply chain game: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and info.  Think of 'em like the members of a super-cool band. Each one has a role to play, and if one's off beat, the whole thing falls apart.\n\nFirst up, we got production - that's where the magic happens! Figuring out what to make, how much, and where, that's the boss move.  Managers gotta be like detectives, sniffin' out what people want. They gotta watch the market, see what's hot, what's not, and make sure they're makin' somethin' everyone's gonna go bananas for.\n\nThen there's supply, which is like the muscle of the operation. Managers gotta figure out where to get all the stuff they need to build their products. They might have different factories for different parts, or they might outsource some stuff to other companies.  It's all about makin' things move fast and smooth, while keepin' the prices low. \n\nThe rest of the players, inventory (keepin' track of all that stuff), location (findin' the best place to make and ship things), transportation (gettin' it all where it needs to go), and info (keepin' everyone in the loop), they all work together to make sure the whole thing runs like a well-oiled machine.\n\nMake sense? Pretty cool, huh?",
            "Hold on, lemme tell ya somethin'. So there's this chick, Ellen Page, ya know, the one from Juno? She's standin' on a corner, holdin' up this cardboard sign. It's got a crazy message scribbled on it with a Sharpie, somethin' about Hitler bein' alive in Burma. Burma, it's also called Myanmar, and it's ruled by these super mean guys, a junta, who took over back in '62.  \n\nSo, back in '07, people in Burma started protestin', like, for real. It was the first time in ages they'd done somethin' like that. Monks, wearin' their saffron robes, led the way, and that's how it got called the \"Saffron Revolution.\" At first, the government was like, \"Whatever,\" let the monks hang out, but then things got outta hand. It turned into a full-blown fight between the monks and the junta, with the army bustin' into monasteries and stuff.  They even threw journalists in jail, and one guy, a Japanese photographer named Kenji, got killed just for bein' there. They say 13 people died, but some guy who ditched the army said it was way more, like, thousands.\n\nThis ain't nothin' new, though. Governments tryin' to shut down anyone who disagrees with 'em has always been a thing.  Remember those Roman emperors? They acted like they were chosen by the gods to rule everything.  And don't even get me started on the Japanese emperors, they think they're gods themselves! And here we have our own president, Bush, chattin' it up with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, which is like, part of the Republican Party. \n\nThere are all these other times this stuff has happened, like that Tiananmen Square protest in 1989, where students and activists got together to say \"no more\" to the government. The Chinese government said 200-300 died, but others say it was like 2,000-3,000. And then there's the Rwandan genocide, where Hutu guys killed all the Tutsis and anyone who wasn't with them.  And let's not forget Hitler and the Holocaust, where they rounded up all the Jews and, well, you know...",
            "Duke Ellington was a big cheese in the jazz world 'cause he stuck around forever and kept making awesome music with his band. Now, you might not hear him wailin' on the piano a whole lot in some of his tunes, but man, this dude was a genius at writing songs that showed off everyone's talent. He'd set the stage for soloists to go wild, AND he'd write super tight arrangements with parts just made for each guy in the band. That's how he made his sound so unique - he knew how to blend all those different flavors into somethin' fresh and exciting. \n\nThe folks over at Grove Music, they say Ellington was like a wizard with voices. Take his song \"Creole Love Call\" - he used voices like instruments, all smooth and jazzy, even without singin' words. He was always findin' ways to make his soloists shine, and \"Creole Love Call\" is a perfect example. It's a slow bluesy tune with six different parts, each one buildin' on the last:\n\n* **Part 1:**  A back-and-forth between a voice and the woodwinds, startin' sweet and mellow, then gettin' rougher towards the end.\n\n* **Part 2:**  A trumpet solo with a muted sound, makin' the melody stretch out and adding some bluesy bends.\n\n* **Part 3:**  A clarinet takes center stage, soaring high up with a piano riff underneath, all snappy and syncopated.\n\n* **Part 4:** The whole band jumps in, echoin' the first part with brass and reeds takin' turns.\n\n* **Part 5:**  This one's the climax! The woodwinds start the call-and-response high up, while the brass and rhythm section playin' a stoppin' and startin' groove.\n\n* **Part 6:**  Back to the first part, but this time the voice gets all growly and soulful, soloin' like an instrument.\n\n* **Ending:** A quick tag with some fancy vocal runs and a trombone doin' somethin' unexpected and cool.\n\nEllington loved usin' voices to add that extra somethin' special to his music, and he did it all over the place. \n\nIn another song called \"Hot and Bothered,\" he gets all fancy with his arrangements, and uses a call-and-response between a muted trumpet player and a scat singer. They're blendin' their sounds so well, the trumpet sounds like a voice and the voice sounds like an instrument - pure magic! And in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" he features a guy named Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, playin' a muted trombone that just grabs you with the melody.",
            "She was always lookin' for somethin', this big hole inside her that nothin' seemed to fill. It started way back when she was 14, just hittin' that teenage groove, and it was still there three years later, at 17. Now, she figured it wasn't a thing she needed, but someone.  But dude, no boys had ever grabbed her attention. Some tried, you know, the whole clumsy wooin' thing, but nothin'. She'd wrack her brain tryin' to figure it out, what kinda messed up mojo made a girl like that, but nothin' clicked. So she just kept rollin' with it, always wonderin'.\n\nHer life at home was usually pretty chill. Her folks were cool cats, never fightin' and rarely yellin', even at her. They only ever butted heads when she was tryin' to spread her wings and do her own thing. She was their kid, yeah, but totally opposite vibes. They were mellow, she was a freakin' firework. Still, everyone loved her.\n\nBut this day was anything but chill. She was wanderin' around, tryin' to spark some inspiration for somethin', when BAM! She heard her mom scream from the kitchen. Heart poundin', she raced in, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mom was sprawled on the floor, makin' little \"ow\" sounds. This chick was in trouble.  She rushed to her side, \"Mom, tell me where to take ya.\"  \"Ow... sweetie...  hospital...\"  Her voice was all crackly. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to meet you.\"  Her mom pointed, and she was thankful she'd taken those self-defense classes. She hefted her mom, tossed her in the back seat, and hit the gas.\n\nThe hospital smelled like bleach and sickness, but she couldn't even notice, too busy focusin' on her mom. She practically dragged her inside, yellin' for help. A bunch of worried faces swarmed, and someone whipped up a gurney, strapped her mom down, and whisked her away. Now she was stuck waitin', anxiety gnawin' at her.\n\nTurns out, her mom had fallen off a step stool reachin' for a fancy vase.",
            "So, gather 'round, folks, and lemme tell ya about this study they did. See, they wanted to know if this fancy \"Mediterranean Diet\" (they call it Med diet for short) could help keep your ticker in tip-top shape. Turns out, this Med diet is all about munchin' on good stuff like fruits, veggies, nuts, and fish, while keepin' the red meat and greasy stuff to a minimum. A little vino is okay too, but don't go overboard! \n\nNow, they already knew this Med diet was good for ya, but nobody had really looked at how it helped with heart attacks or strokes. So, they got this big group of nurses, over 70,000 of 'em, and asked 'em about what they ate every year for 20 years. They made sure to track all the juicy details, like exercise, smokin', and even if they took vitamins.\n\nAfter all that time, they found out that the nurses who ate the most Med-style were way less likely to have a heart attack or a stroke. It's like, the more they chowed down on that healthy stuff, the less likely they were to end up in the hospital. Pretty cool, huh?",
            "Okay, so back in 2007,  America totally crashed harder than Mack's last robot creation.  You know, the one with the disco ball and the flamethrower?  Yeah, this was a whole other level of messed up.  Jobs disappeared faster than Foxy after a free pizza buffet, and houses were worth less than a chewed-up sock.  Even the big, fancy companies were going, \"Uh oh, we're outta here!\" It's still kinda a mess, so let me tell ya, something went wrong.  Big time.  \n\nTurns out, those fancy pants politicians made some really dumb decisions. They pushed banks to give out loans to anyone, even if they couldn't afford 'em.  It was like giving B.B. a credit card and telling him to buy candy.  Disaster waiting to happen!  And these places called Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they were like, \"Let's take these risky loans and make 'em into something shiny and new!\"  They called it a \"mortgage-backed security\" or something.  Sounds fancy, right?  Turns out, it was just a fancy way of saying, \"We're gonna gamble with your money!\"\n\nNow, this whole mess started back in the Clinton days.  Remember when he was president?  He wanted to look good, so he made it easier to get loans.  Seemed like a good idea at the time, but it was like setting a box of dynamite on the couch.  One spark and boom!  \n\nThen they started making these mortgages that changed interest rates like a chameleon changes colors.  And they bundled them all up into these big, complicated things called CDOs.  It was like a house of cards, except made of debt.  And guess what?  The cards fell.  People couldn't pay their loans, the banks were broke, and the whole economy went kablooey!   The big banks?  They lost tons of money.  Even the government had to step in and save the day, but it cost a whole lot of dough.  So yeah, that's the story of the financial crisis.  A bunch of bad decisions, some fancy-sounding words, and a whole lotta chaos.",
            "Okay, so, exposition. That part in your story where you're supposed to dazzle everyone with your writing, right?  The part where readers either get hooked or click away faster than you can say \"character development.\"  Even Dr. Merlin, the awesome writer, has been known to yell at her computer screen when she gets stuck in a boring, info-dumping mess.\n\nBelieve me, exposition is not your friend.\n\nWe all know \"Show, don't tell,\" but sometimes Dr. Merlin (and maybe even you!) gets carried away with too much telling.  It's like that little voice in your head whispering, \"Get all the backstory out of the way so we can get to the good stuff!\"  But that voice can be a real pain. \n\nThink of exposition like the character who tells everyone everything at once, like a walking encyclopedia.  It's the equivalent of someone saying, \"Oh, by the way, this princess was raised in a tower, she has a talking animal sidekick, and her evil stepmother tried to kill her – but let's get to the exciting part!\"\n\nHere's a classic example: You're reading a story and you're told the heroine met her soulmate, got married in a fancy ceremony, and then her husband was murdered right in front of her.  You wouldn't want the whole story of their love to take up two pages of dialogue-less descriptions.  You want to see their love, feel it, understand it! Show us how much he loved her through his actions and words.  Show us how her life changed for the better because of him.  Give us a reason to actually care about him and her! \n\nBasically, you want more than just the bare bones. You want the juicy details, the emotions, the connections!",
            "Alright, so I watched a couple newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. One was NBC 4, live this mornin', August 13, 2011.  First up, this dude Shad Hostettler, stabbed his wife, Ashley, Ohio, messed up real bad. They showed his mug shot – looked like a total jerk. They only gave it about two minutes, though. Said he stabbed her a bunch of times. They caught the creep, so that's good. \n \nNext up, young Travis Buyers, 18, shot down in Sharon Woods. Real bad shape, no arrests yet, SWAT team on the case. Seemed kinda rushed, like they didn't wanna talk about it too much. Kinda makes you wonder if it's 'cause he was black, ya know? 'Cause when it's a white kid, the whole town freaks out. But when it's a minority, it's like, whatever.  \n \nThen they had a story about a bullet hole in a Med-Flight helicopter.  .22 caliber, rifle shot. They were lookin' for the shooter, Crime-Stoppers offerin' five grand for tips. \n \nRain and heat comin' Saturday, they said. Short story, just a tease to keep ya watchin'.  \n \nThen a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. They described the robber as a tall, skinny, dark-skinned black dude in a hoodie. Seemed like they were really playin' up his race, which is kinda weird. \n \nLast one was about Rene Rodriguez, this Texas drug kingpin.  They called him a \"Hispanic man\" which, come on, really? Anyway, he got 300 months in prison, which is 25 years, but they said it like that to make it sound scarier, I guess.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya about brothers, man. It's like, there's this crazy connection, ya know? It's like a messed up rollercoaster of emotions, all tangled up together.  There's love, sure, but also pride, jealousy, and even straight-up meanness. Brothers get each other like nobody else, man. It's like lookin' in a mirror, seein' yourself, but messed up and twisted. \n\nWhen things get rough, that's when the real deal comes out. It's either gonna be good or bad, no in-between.  And let me tell ya, all this brotherly stuff, it comes with a price. It ain't all sunshine and roses.\n\nThis whole brother thing, man, it's about seein' your reflection in another person, not just how people see you, but the real you, the good and the bad. \n\nThis story, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" it's all about this, ya know? These two brothers, they're messin' around in this crazy, beautiful place, but it's all going south fast. Pride and disappointment, it's like a bomb ready to go off.  In the end, only one brother makes it out alive.  \n\nIt's all about how the main guy feels, and how he sees himself and his brother. You can see it in his actions, in the things he does and the stuff that happens because of it. That's what makes him who he is.",
            "Yo, check it! The brain, it's like, super complex, ya know? It's all about taking in info and making stuff up like a mad scientist. Back in the day, people thought it was like a wax tablet, then papyrus, then a book, and now they're sayin' it's like a computer. But hold up, those are just comparisons, see? They don't tell the whole story, so don't go gettin' all hung up on 'em.\n\nSo, your senses, they're like the input, right? They grab stuff from the world - touch, sound, light, heat - and turn it into signals the brain can understand. Then, the brain, it's like a crazy party, with all these signals gettin' passed around and changed up. Like, when you see a box on a white background, your brain starts piecing together the colors, shapes, edges, all that jazz. That's bottom-up processing, man.  But then, your brain also uses what it already knows - like \"boxes are usually solid\" - to figure out what it's lookin' at faster. That's top-down processing, like a shortcut.\n\nNow, the brain's got this thing called attention, think of it like a bouncer at a club. It decides what's important and lets some signals in while shooing others away. You see a million blades of grass, but you don't notice each one individually, right? That's attention filterin' out the noise. But your name? BAM! That gets through the bouncer like you're on the guest list.\n\nBut hold up, before we can do anything with info, we gotta store it. There's short-term memory, kinda like a notepad, and long-term memory, the big ol' filing cabinet.  Short-term memory holds stuff for a few seconds, and they think it's like electrical signals buzzin' around in your brain. Long-term memory, well, that's a mystery, but they think it's stored in the way proteins are built.\n\nThere are tons of theories about how our brain organizes all this knowledge, like maps and networks. One idea is that concepts are like nodes, connected by how related they are. So \"chair\" is linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "Sa2b here. So, check it out. This dude Huxley wrote this story, \"Brave New World,\" and it's totally messed up, man. He's like, \"Whoa, technology and all this money stuff is gonna be our downfall!\"  \n\nSee, in this story, everyone's all happy-happy, but they're like robots, man. They're told to be happy all the time and just go with the flow. No thinking, no real feelings, just instant gratification. It's like they're hypnotized by this guy in charge, the World Controller, who's basically the big cheese.\n\nHuxley was onto something, though. Remember how Marx talked about how everyone gets tricked into thinking they're doing good when they're just working for the man?  That's totally what's happening here. The people are so obsessed with stuff and being happy that they don't even realize they're being manipulated. It's like they're in a trance.\n\nHe's using this thing called \"false consciousness,\"  where people are basically too busy trying to get the next shiny thing to see what's really going on. They're like, \"Gimme, gimme!\" and the World Controller is like, \"Sure, here you go, but don't ask questions!\"\n\nAnd get this - the rich guys know what's up, but they just let it happen. They're like, \"Yeah, we're in charge, and they're fine with it.\"  It's messed up, man.\n\nHuxley also shows how people just don't connect with each other anymore. They're so focused on themselves and their stuff that they don't even have real relationships. It's all superficial, like a bunch of robots going through the motions.\n\nHe's basically saying that technology and capitalism are killing our humanity.  It's a wake-up call, man.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya, this whole campus thing is a real trip. Been here for two and a half years, four and a half semesters, and let me tell ya, getting around this place can be a real pain in the tail feathers. Freshman year, I got stuck in East Halls, which is like, a million miles from everywhere else.  I mean, to get to Willard building, which is practically in the middle of campus, it could take me 25 minutes just walkin', and that’s if the weather's decent.  State College weather, man, it's like a roller coaster itself!  \n\nTalked to an old grad, not too much older than me, and he said things used to be even worse. Back in the day, East Halls was like its own little island, surrounded by nothin' but empty fields. Now, they've built all these new sports fields, fancy buildings like the Creamery and that new health center, and apartments everywhere. It's like they just keep buildin' and buildin', but nobody thinks about how to get around.\n\nSo, what's the answer to this campus traffic jam? Bikes, baby! But it's not just about havin' the bike, you gotta have a campus that works for cyclists.\n\nMy buddy, he got back into ridin' after a few years off, and he was like, \"Man, I can't believe I ever stopped. Bikes are the only way to go!\"  They're good for ya, too, healthy and all that jazz. Plus, you can go far on a tank of oatmeal and a little leg power. \n\nI live off-campus now, 'bout as far from the center as some dorms, but I bought a bike this year and it was the best decision ever. My classes are in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk, but on my bike, it's like, 5 minutes if I crank it up.  \n\nOf course, Pollock Road, the closest route, can be a real hazard, but hey, what can ya do? Sometimes you gotta ride through the madness.  Walkin' ain't bad, but I'm always on the go.  Without my bike, I'd be walkin' to class, appointments, everywhere, and that's just too much time lost. That's like, two and a half hours a week, man!"

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "So listen up, 'cause Sa2b's about to lay some truth on ya! See, I'm thinkin' about goin' full-on social worker, helpin' out those lil' rugrats who've had a rough go of it, ya know?  And maybe lend a hand to families that are, let's say, seein' some tough times. Now, lemme tell ya, I'm all about servin' others, treatin' everyone with respect, and doin' the right thing, ya dig? That ain't just some social worker mumbo jumbo, that's how I roll in life.\n\nTruth be told, I've always wanted to make a difference, but didn't know exactly how.  Back in high school and college, I saw folks tryin' to run from their problems, doin' some real whack stuff to cope. It made me wanna do somethin'.  I even got myself a psychology degree, but still wasn't sure what path to take. \n\nThen one summer, I met this kid, sixteen years old and lookin' all nervous. My buddy was takin' care of him 'cause he was runnin' from his abusive parents. Turns out, the kid called the cops on 'em! So I figured I'd lend a hand. I talked to the cops, told 'em I was a recent grad, and they asked me to talk to the parents. Let me tell ya, those folks were shifty! They were all nervous and makin' excuses about their son bein' a manipulator. After that, I knew right then and there I wanted to be a social worker, helpin' kids like that get the support they need.\n\nAnd another thing that's really important to me is social justice. Society always goes on about how special each individual is, but then they try to make us all the same.  It's like, if we're all so unique, why are we always tryin' to fit in?  I'm unique, and I ain't gonna apologize for it! Through high school and college, I stood up for what's right whenever I could: dyed my hair crazy colors, wore what I wanted, pierced my ears, joined the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance, fought against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it.  I believe in standin' up for what's right, and I'll keep doin' it!",
            "Okay, so check it out. This paper wants to break down insomnia, you know, that whole not-sleeping thing.  It's lookin' at two main ways people think about it: the biology side and the social/cultural side.  \n\nOn the biology side, they're talkin' genes, family history, and all that stuff that's, like, hard-wired into your body. Like, maybe you got a messed up gene that messes with your sleep.  They're also talkin' about how our brains work, especially this part called the hypothalamus. It's like the sleep-wake control center.\n\nThe social/cultural side is all about your environment, like where you live, who you hang with, and how much money you got.  They think these things can totally affect your sleep too.\n\nThis paper looks at a bunch of studies, like, real science stuff, to see if these models, the biology and the social stuff, actually make sense. They even point out the good and bad parts of each study.  \n\nFirst, they talk about different types of sleep problems. Like, insomnia (can't fall asleep), hypersomnia (too much sleep), narcolepsy (falling asleep randomly), and nightmares. Then they get specific about insomnia.\n\nThey found this one study where they messed with mice brains and found that these receptors called GABAB receptors play a big role in sleep.  Like, if you mess with these receptors, you mess with sleep. They think this might be true for humans too.\n\nSo, if you have a messed up GABAB receptor, maybe that's why you can't sleep. And that's where the social stuff comes in. If you're poor or stressed out or whatever, it could make your sleep problems even worse.",
            "Alright, so check it out, this thing called CAPD, it's like when your brain's not quite getting the message from your ears, you know? It's not that you can't hear, it's more like your brain's having trouble figuring out what it's hearing.  \n\nThink of it like this: You hear a bunch of sounds, like a bunch of people talking and music playing, but your brain's getting mixed up trying to figure out who's saying what and what's going on.  \n\nThey've been figuring out how to spot this stuff for a while now, back in the '50s, people started noticing kids who had trouble understanding what they heard.  They figured out some tests to see if someone's brain was having trouble with sounds, like trying to pick out words from a bunch of noise or telling the difference between similar sounds.\n\nCAPD can show up in a bunch of different ways.  Some folks might have trouble telling where a sound is coming from, or they might struggle to understand what someone's saying if there's a lot of background noise.  Some people might have trouble understanding jokes or sarcasm because their brain's not picking up on the changes in someone's voice. \n\nTo figure out if someone has CAPD, they do a bunch of tests, like listening for sounds, figuring out what words they hear, or paying attention to changes in sounds.\n\nThe tricky part is that there's no single test that's perfect for diagnosing CAPD. And even though they've been studying it for a while, they still don't know exactly what causes it.",
            "So, Shakespeare's play, Twelfth Night, kinda says that while pretending to be someone else can work for a while, eventually ya gotta ditch the fake identity or you might lose yourself completely. But here's the catch: tellin' people the truth can mess things up bad. Some folks might not care that they were fooled, but others could get real mad and feel hurt.  It's like, do you protect yourself or your relationships?\n\nGender disguises make this whole thing even trickier. Why would someone wanna hide who they really are and pretend to be the opposite gender?  Well, in Viola's case, it's all about safety. She's a newbie in this new land, and she figures she's safer as a dude. \"I'll introduce you to a captain in this town/ Where my girl clothes are kept, thanks to his kindness/ I was saved to serve this noble count.” (5.1.247-249)\n\nBut here's the thing: pretending to be a guy cuts her off from other women, who could be a good support system. And get this, she's so good at it that Olivia,  this rich lady, falls head over heels for \"Cesario,\" thinking he's a dude! \"Stay, my lord, Cesario, husband.\" (5.1.138)  Not to mention, she has these feelings for Orsino, who's totally smitten with her, but thinks she's a dude.  \"Boy, you've told me a thousand times/ You must never love a woman like me.\" (5.1. 260-261)\n\nTwelfth Night is like a mirror reflecting how pretending can bring hidden feelings to the surface. Olivia and Orsino might be dealing with stuff they didn't even know they felt. Maybe Olivia's attracted to Cesario because he looks like a guy, or maybe she secretly likes women?  It's hard to say.  But Shakespeare seems to be poking fun at how people back then judged folks based on looks alone.  Olivia switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian (Viola's twin brother) super quick, and treats Cesario like family, not a love interest: “Sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "Alright, so ya know how everyone's always sayin' the Germans were real rough on the natives back in the day? Like, total bad guys?  Well, true enough, especially in South West Africa where they went overboard with the whole \"killin' everyone\" thing. But hold your horses, it wasn't all bad everywhere. Germany ran a bunch of colonies, and each one was different, kinda like how some folks in your family are total weirdos while others are kinda cool. \n\nWhen the Brits took over German East Africa (that's Tanganyika now), they were surprised to find a bunch of smart Africans who could read and write. Turns out, the Germans actually did a decent job in some places, like Kamerun. But South West Africa? That's where things got weird. \n\nUnlike in East Africa where the government built schools and stuff for the locals, in South West Africa, they kinda just shrugged and said, \"Hey, missionaries, you take care of it.\"  They threw a little bit of money their way, but not much. Meanwhile, they went hog wild building schools for the white folks, like they were the only ones who mattered. This messed things up big time in South West Africa, even after the Germans packed their bags.  While other colonies had plenty of smart, educated Africans, South West Africa was left behind.\n\nSo what happened? Why was South West Africa so different? Well, a bunch of stuff, like the people who lived there, the government, and the economy. This paper is gonna dig into all that and see what we can figure out.\n\nThere's a ton of stuff written about German schools in their colonies. Most of it's in German and was written way back when they were running the show. Back then, people were mostly just tryin' to figure out what these schools were like. Later, some folks in English started comparing the schools in different colonies and lookin' closer at specific parts of them. They found that each colony was different, just like I said.\n\nOne guy, Cohen, wrote a whole book about schools in South West Africa and East Africa. He compared them and figured out why they were so different. He thinks the big population of white folks in South Africa had a lot to do with it.\n\nSouth West Africa wasn't as hot and humid as some of the other German colonies, although it was pretty dry and desert-y.  That meant more white folks wanted to live there. By 1913, almost 15,000 white folks lived there, compared to only 5,000 in East Africa, which was the next most populated colony.",

It's all about pushing boundaries, man, exploring the dark side of life,  and letting those emotions flow.\n\nEven those old Romantic poets, they knew about that darkness, and metal bands have definitely picked up on that vibe.

Born way back in 1844, he wasn't some rich art kid. His dad was a hardware guy, and Rousseau worked for the government collectin' tolls for years. He never went to art school, not even once! He was like, forty years old before he decided to paint. Even worse, his first wife and most of his kids died, so he was heartbroken. Painting became his escape, his way to start fresh.  \n\nSo, Rousseau wanted to be a big shot in the art world, and it makes sense why. He was a late bloomer, didn't have any fancy training, and all these other talented artists were gettin' all the attention.  He was tryin' hard, but folks weren't really seein' what he was doin'.  It wasn't until Matisse started makin' a name for himself that Rousseau finally started gettin' some recognition.  This guy Gordon, who wrote a book about French painters, said that Rousseau and Matisse were different in every way. Matisse was all about bein' unique, while Rousseau just wanted to paint something so classic that the art world would finally accept him.",
            "So, like, a bunch of really smart peeps think that  being good and looking good are totally connected, ya know? Like, they're like besties.  It's like what Keats said in his poem about that fancy old urn: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That's all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn a lot from school and stuff, but we just *get* good and good-looking stuff without anyone telling us, ya know? Both good stuff and pretty stuff are all about explaining why something is good or pretty, not like, making rules for how to be good or make pretty things.\n\nThink about it, when someone's all, \"This painting is amazing!\" they can talk about stuff like colors and stuff, but it's still not the whole story. It's like, \"There's just something about it!\"  \n\nLike, even when we try to explain why something's good,  it's like, there's this extra somethin' somethin' we can't quite put our finger on. It's like O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\"\n\nEthics and art, they both have this extra somethin' somethin' that makes them super powerful. It's like a vibe, ya know? Like, we feel it in our gut, but can't explain it with words.\n\nAnd books, man, they're even more intense because they're all about values, like, what's important in life.  McKean said it best: \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\"",
            "Germany today is a real powerhouse, a country united with its own unique culture. It's like, picture this: you've got Munich, all high-tech and fancy in the Bavarian Alps, and then you got Kiel by the Baltic Sea, chillin' with its own vibe.  It's the same kinda cool feeling you get from Cologne on the Rhine River, all the way through the middle of Germany to Dresden, that fancy city on the Elbe. With so much going on, it's no wonder Germany's culture is a mix of everything, a melting pot from different tribes and stuff. \n\nBack in the day, this land was called Germania, and where the name came from? Well, that's a whole mystery! Some say this dude Tacitus, a history guy, thought it came from a tribe called the Tungrians, who were, like, the OG Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought with Gaulish dudes. Julius Caesar, the Roman guy who conquered Gaul, was the first to use the word \"Germanus\" to talk about the tribes he didn't conquer, like, \"those guys are Germans, they're different from the Gauls I beat.\" Some think it came from the Gauls themselves, kinda like a label to say \"these guys are not us!\"  Others think it came from their spears, called \"ger,\" or maybe from the old Irish word \"garim\" which means \"to shout,\" 'cause, you know, Germans were loud!\n\nTacitus, the Roman dude from way back, wrote this book called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" in 98 AD, all about where the Germans came from. He said that they were like, the original inhabitants, not mixed with anyone else. He thought nobody in their right mind would leave Asia or Africa for Germany, unless, like, it was their home!\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Not a chance! The Romans would send out their troops to get stuff and wage war, but they mostly stayed in their big empire.  But those Germanic tribes kept popping up, living on the borders of the Roman Empire. They traded their goods and even served in the Roman army, which was pretty cool.",
            "Down there, the porcelain throne stared back at me.  My brain, man, it was just... vacant.  Like, I saw the mess, but it wasn't really *seeing* it, ya know?  Thoughts popped up, like bubbles in a murky pond, then vanished just as fast.  It was like watching a movie,  but I wasn't really in it.\n\nSo, I got this book once, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  Always wanted to draw, since I was a kid.  This book, it's all about how your brain  sees stuff, you know,  like,  how a pencil is more than just a stick.  One trick it teaches is to put a square around whatever you're looking at.  Like, if you're looking at a bowl of fruit, bam!  Square.  Suddenly it's not this giant, overwhelming thing, just the bowl of fruit.\n\nBut here I was, staring at this...thing...and I couldn't even mentally put that square down.  I was  mesmerized, man.  Picasso had his blue phase, Monet loved his greens, those Renaissance guys, they were all about the color explosion.  Me?  I was staring at my own brown masterpiece.   \n\nMy hand hovered over the toilet brush, muscles tense, ready to strike.  It was like the start of a masterpiece, you know?  Water swirling, smooth and clear,  little bits of...stuff...floating away.  But then, my hand jerked, panicked.  The thing wouldn't budge.  Stuck fast, like a bad dream.\n\nMop in one hand, tie choking me out, I glared at the brown mess. Someone's \"art project.\"  A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet contemplation, then I reached for the toilet paper.  Wrapped it around my hand like a freaking oven mitt.  Straight up, then bent over, my hand dipped into the bowl.  Like a mom checking the turkey, except way less delicious.",
            "Yo! So, get this, teenagers are like, totally crashing their cars left and right. It's like, a major bummer, you know? Apparently, their brains ain't fully cooked yet for all the crazy stuff that happens on the road. Plus, they're like, super inexperienced.  Think about it: they're more likely to, like, smash their cars, flip 'em over, zoom way too fast, or even drive right off the road!\n\nAnd get this, things get even worse when they've got their buddies in the car. Like, duh, that's what they do, right? But seriously, it makes stuff way more dangerous. Some brainiacs in California figured this out, and they're all, \"Hey, maybe we should make things harder for teens to drive.\" So, they came up with this thing called a \"provisional license\" – basically, limited driving hours and no passengers under a certain age. Sounds kinda lame, right?\n\nBut here's the deal: It ain't really solving the problem.  This one psychologist dude, Marvin Zuckerman, says even 18 is too young to be driving because teens just crave that adrenaline rush, ya know?  They're all about taking risks for the thrill.  So, maybe we should just wait a few more years until they chill out a bit before they get behind the wheel. \n\nIf we keep letting teens drive, it's gonna be a real mess.  Like, a whole lot of accidents and people getting hurt.  It's not gonna be pretty, especially with all those baby boomers' kids hitting the road soon.\n\nWe need to do something about it, man!  Schools can still teach 'em how to drive, but no one under 18 should be allowed on the road.  They can get a temporary permit and practice with an adult, but no solo driving until they're older.\n\nIt's gotta be a national thing, too, so everyone's on the same page. It's not rocket science, right?",
            "So, I was checking out all these old Edison films at the Library of Congress. You know, those super early ones? I found fifteen trick films from way back when, between 1895 and 1901.  These films are all about using clever editing to pull off crazy illusions. I mainly looked at how they did that in most of the films and  noticed a few that were a little different, pushing the boundaries.\n\nMost of these trick films were pretty basic. They stuck to the same setup every time: a stage-like set, the camera just hanging out in one spot, no fancy camera moves, and long shots, like you're looking at a whole scene at once. They also stuck to this rule: one shot, one film.  No messing around with cutting between different shots.\n\nBut then, there were a few films that started to sneak in some stuff like multiple shots, which was pretty wild for the time!  \n\nOne thing all these films had in common was this set-up. Imagine a stage with a curtain at the front. That's basically what these films looked like. The camera wouldn't move, it just stayed put, like a front-row seat at a show. This was super common back then, especially for magic shows and vaudeville. The problem was, because they were stuck in this \"stage\" setup, the actors could only move side to side, never towards or away from the camera. Like in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), the actors walk back and forth across the screen, but the camera never follows them.\n\nBecause of this stage-like setup, the shots were always long or medium shots.  No close-ups, ever! This came from the theatre and vaudeville, where the audience wanted to see the whole thing at once.  Since the actors never walked towards the camera, there was no need for close-ups.\n\nAnd get this, most of these trick films stuck to one idea per film. It meant they were really short, like just a minute or less. They couldn't tell a much of a story because they were so short. They were more like little vaudeville acts, with magic tricks, disappearing stuff, and switching things around. But here's the thing: what looked like one shot to us, might actually be several shots put together to make the magic happen, like in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895). If you look really closely, you'll see where they switched shots to make it look like her head was chopped off!",
            "Alright, so there's this dude, John Taylor, from Caroline. This guy was all about the whole \"Republican\" thing, ya know, back in the day.  He mostly did farming stuff, but even that, plus his little stint in politics, made him a real loudmouth when it came to freedom and stuff.\n\nSee, Taylor was all about farms.  He thought farming was the best job ever, and that's what made him think the way he did about the government. He wanted to keep farms strong, and that's why he got so worked up about how the government worked, like the Constitution and even the courts.\n\nThis guy thought America had a shot at making things perfect, 'cause there wasn't any old tradition messing things up. He thought we could make our own rules, ya know, do our own thing.  He believed everyone had rights, like, super important rights, and if one was messed with, they all were, see? He thought the government shouldn't mess with those rights at all. He was like, \"Man's natural state\" means the strong guys are the ones who win, but in a society, that ain't right.\"\n\nTo make this perfect society, Taylor thought the government had to be built to understand that people are good and bad at the same time. He was super strict about this idea of good and evil. He said, \"Government is run by humans, so it's gotta have both good and bad parts.\" He thought good stuff meant protecting your stuff, making farming better, and not liking capitalism too much.  He figured a good government would work fair no matter who was running it, 'cause everyone's greedy anyway.  He saw greed as normal, but bad when it meant making a bunch of groups that hurt each other.  A good government was needed to keep the bad stuff in check, but even then, had to be watched close so it didn't get worse.\n\nLike a lot of Republicans back then, Taylor thought the Constitution should be followed exactly as it was written. He wanted a government that didn't have much power, only what was in the Constitution. He knew a big government was expensive and could be a real pain. But he didn't think just reading the words was enough, you had to know what the guys who wrote it *meant.* He even thought the Declaration of Independence was more important, 'cause it said America was a bunch of states, not one big country.",
            "Alright, so check this out. We had this thing going where people logged their commutes, right? Figure 17 shows that things went *totally* downhill in month three. Kind of bummed us out, gotta be honest. We figured maybe it was the weather. Winter hit hard in New England, and who wants to bike or walk when it's freezing? Plus, December is crazy busy for everyone at college - finals, grades, the whole shebang.  Maybe the log thing just got lost in the shuffle. Then there's the holidays, with everyone gone for a month. School's back in session in January, but still, not a lot of logs. February was a mystery, though.  \n\nMaybe at first everyone was all hyped up about the project, and then things just fizzled out. To get things rolling again, we did this \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, and it actually worked! More people started logging their commutes. But the lesson was clear: keeping people engaged is tough, especially with all the breaks and stuff that happen in college.\n\nAnother big thing? People *love* their cars. It's like a national obsession. So, we had to bribe them with prizes! Gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, even massages. We thought it was pretty sweet, but maybe we should've gone bigger - like a fancy bike, a hybrid car, even an electric one! Think that would've brought in more people.\n\nWe kept the same prizes throughout the whole project. Maybe changing things up would've helped. Imagine if we announced at the start of December that we'd give away a couple bikes, and then in January, a hybrid or electric car! I bet we'd see a ton more people logging their commutes.",
            "Alright, lemme break this down for ya.  See, these things called ETFs are like supercharged index funds. They track stuff like stocks or even whole markets, but you can buy and sell 'em just like regular stock, ya know?  It's like the best of both worlds, but lemme tell ya, there's a catch. \n\nThese ETFs, they cost less to run than those index funds, but ya gotta pay a fee every time ya buy or sell 'em. Kinda like payin' a toll road, except instead of a bridge, it's your money.  But hey, the good news is, there's a ton of different ETFs out there, so you can find one that fits your style.\n\nNow, some smart folks like to check if these ETFs really do what they say they do.  Like, let's say there's this ETF called IHF.  It's got a bunch of stocks inside, but what if those stocks ain't doin' so hot?  Could be better off just buyin' those stocks straight up, ya know? \n\nSo, what these brainiacs did was they took a look at IHF's top ten stocks, the ones that make up most of the ETF. They figured if those ten stocks are doin' well, then the whole ETF should be doin' well too.  And guess what?  They found out that just buyin' those ten stocks might actually give ya a better return, and even less risk!\n\nBut wait, there's more! They also checked if the risk level, called Beta, was the same for the ETF and the ten stocks.  Turns out, the ten stocks were a little less risky.\n\nSo, it looks like sometimes you might be better off just pickin' your own stocks instead of usin' an ETF.  But hey, that's just one story.  Gotta do your own research, ya know?",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this poem \"Dream-Land\" by Edgar Allan Poe, a real head-scratcher. Poe talks about this place called \"Thule\" twice, and it's got a whole history. Turns out, some dude named Virgil used it first, back in the day, to describe a place way up north, like the end of the world, ya know? But get this, Poe was a big fan of German authors, especially this guy Goethe. Now, Goethe had a poem called \"The King of Thulé\" about this sad king who loses his wife and goes on a downward spiral, drinking and grieving 'til he finally kicks the bucket.  Sounds kinda familiar to Poe's style, right?  It's like Poe took that whole vibe and threw it into \"Dream-Land\". Poe even uses \"Thule\" as a bookend in \"Dream-Land\", like he's putting a stamp on it. Kinda makes ya wonder if Poe was taking inspiration from Goethe, ya know?  Poe was smart, he knew his stuff, and he loved to play with ideas. Plus, Goethe was a big deal back then, everyone was talking about him, so Poe probably picked it up somehow. It's like a little secret message for all the smart folks who know their literature.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this lady, Jennifer Palmer. She took a spill in a grocery store, tripped on some spilled applesauce, and went 'boom' - busted back! Now, she's sayin' the store manager, this dude Martin, shoulda known better 'cause folks had been slipping on stuff all over the place. She's talkin' about suein' for some extra cash, not just for her busted back, but 'cause she thinks Martin was bein' a real jerk about it all.\n\nSee, Martin got told twice about the applesauce mess, but he was too busy stuffin' his face with dinner, he says. \"Nah, I ain't got time for customer complaints,\" he says. So, an hour later, Jennifer comes along, slips, and BAM! Injury city.\n\nNow, in California, ya can get extra dough if ya prove someone was bein' a real jerk, like they meant to hurt ya or were willfully ignorin' that their mess could hurt someone. Jennifer's sayin' Martin totally knew people were gettin' hurt from these spills, but he didn't care. He's basically sayin', \"Let 'em slip, I got my dinner!\"\n\nThe judge ain't gonna throw the case out just yet. Jennifer's got some points, 'specially since this ain't the first time this kinda thing happened.  But whether she can prove Martin was bein' a total jerk, that's another story.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this Islam class I took ages ago. We were all huffing and puffing about whether Islam was, ya know, a bad religion or not.  Still think it's a head-scratcher, especially after 9/11, ya know? \n\nThe news went from totally bashing Islam to, like, kissing its feet.  Can you believe it? We'd never see a dude named Barack Obama running for president back then, especially with that Muslim family history of his. \n\nThis Muhammad dude's story is kinda messed up, too. I thought he was all about force-feeding Islam down people's throats, conquering tribes and making 'em convert. But this book paints him as a, get this, martyr! Misunderstood, humble, the whole nine yards. People just flocked to him, seein' the light and all. Sounds fishy, right?\n\nAnd get this, there's some crazy similarities between Jesus and Muhammad.  Like this one time Muhammad turned mutton and milk into a whole feast for forty guys!  They're trying to make Muhammad look like a humble prophet, like he didn't need to prove anything, just living his truth and whatnot.  It's bogus, man, it totally downplays Jesus' awesomeness.\n\nThere's also all these stories about how people converted to Islam on their own, but they're all secondhand, like whispers down a hallway.  Someone told someone who told someone else.  It's not exactly solid proof, if you ask me.\n\nThe whole thing just feels like they're trying to elevate Muhammad, make him out to be some godly dude.  But history says he was more of a power-hungry dude, and it makes me wonder if Muslims today even know the real story behind his rise to the top.",
            "Hold on to your hats, folks, 'cause things are about to get wild in the world of Christianity! It's like this: Jesus dropped some serious knowledge bombs back in the day, but after he bounced, things got kinda... messy.  Think of it like a game of telephone, where the message gets twisted with every retelling.  Now, the world's getting woke and progressive faster than a cheetah on espresso.  The old-timers might grumble and cling to their dusty teachings, but they ain't gonna stop the tide.  \n\nGet this: Christians are gonna start digging deep into their history, like archaeologists unearthing a lost treasure.  They'll be like, \"Hold up a sec, what exactly did Jesus actually teach?\" and they'll peel back all those layers of extra stuff that got added over the years.  It might take a while, maybe even a few centuries, but lemme tell ya, it's gonna happen.  It's like rewinding time on a clock, going back to the good ol' days when it was all about Jesus and his message.\n\nWhen this wave hits America and Europe, churches will be packed, but with a twist.  Instead of a million different flavors of Christianity, everyone will be singing from the same hymn book.  Think of it like a big, happy family reunion where everyone's finally getting along.  History's full of these crazy reversals, like how the Romans turned from persecuting Christians to becoming Christians themselves.  And remember how America used to have slavery, but now? Well, African Americans are leading the charge!\n\nSo, get ready for a major shake-up in the Christian world.  It'll start with people realizing that Jesus' words are more like metaphors than a rulebook.  And then, boom!  Back to basics.  \n\nNow, let's rewind back to the beginning, to those early days of Judaism, the root of the whole Christian thing.  Back then, it was all about one God, divine messages, and those ancient Hebrew scriptures.  But even then, there were different groups, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and Zealots.",
            "Man, this book, *The Jungle*, it's like lookin' at a whole city just full of jerks. You know, the kinda guys who think the world revolves around 'em. Like these factory bosses, they're all about makin' their money, makin' their factories bigger, louder, and smokier. They don't care about the workers, they don't care about the air they're pollutin', they just wanna see those profits roll in. This one part, it says the buildings are \"clear-cut and black against the sky\" and the smoke's just streamin' out forever. It's like they're tryin' to choke the whole thing, you know?\n\nAnd get this, these bosses, they don't even think twice before tossin' workers aside like yesterday's news.  They make 'em work crazy hours, then bam! Layoffs! No warning, no help, nothin'. It's like they're sayin', \"Tough luck, pal, find another gig!\" You see, back then, there weren't any rules to protect the workers.  It was a free-for-all, and these bosses, they were like wild animals.\n\nThe book even says it straight up: the workers are just slaves.  No rights, no power, just stuck in this awful system. They're treated worse than dirt, and there's no one to help 'em. Unions try to step in, but they just end up makin' things worse, takin' money from the people they're supposed to be helpin'.

            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this author dude, F. Scott Fitzgerald. He's got this knack for makin' ya feel things, ya know? He uses all sorts of tricks to do it, some work better than others.  Take his book, *The Great Gatsby*, for example. He likes to throw together words that don't usually hang out together, like two random dudes at a party. That throws ya off, makes ya think.  He also loves to use symbols, like colors, to make ya feel somethin' special.  He's got this thing for gold, green, white and gray, and red and pink. He builds up this whole vibe around these colors, then BAM! He uses 'em to make ya remember somethin' important, somethin' that'll stick with ya.\n\nTake white and gray, for instance. He makes 'em mean somethin' special, see? White is kinda fancy, like someone rich wearin' a crisp white shirt. Gray, on the other hand, is older, faded, like somethin' that's been around the block a few times. He starts throwin' these colors around from the get-go. Daisy and Jordan are always in white, everyone's wearin' white, like it's the only color that matters. Even Nick, when he's at Gatsby's party, he's rockin' white flannels. It's like a white takeover!  \n\nThen, bam, Fitzgerald throws in some gray. He describes the names on Nick's timetable as \"gray names,\" like they're nothin' special. He says Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" all uniform and boring.  Even the people are white or gray – Daisy and Jordan had a \"white girlhood,\" there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes. It's like he's sayin' that these things, these people, they're just part of the background, nothin' special.\n\nSo, what's his point? Well, he starts usin' these colors to make us feel somethin' about Daisy. After a while, he describes her in white again, like she's just another piece of the puzzle, somethin' Gatsby wants. He even says she's got a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar,\" like she's lost in the fog of it all. \n\nFitzgerald's really good at usin' colors to talk about things that are important, and he does it in a way that makes ya feel somethin' deep down.",
            "Man, San Diego is like, totally ripe for growing stuff, ya know? It's all sunny and cozy there. They grow this crazy amount of tomatoes, citrus, greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. It's crazy! And get this, there are tons of people who are all about that organic life, like, seriously, they're willing to wait forever for their veggies. They're even nuts for organic eggs and milk! \n\nA lot of these farms give tours, too, and you can even go hiking and birdwatching there. It's like, a win-win! You get to help the environment, make some cash, and teach people about farming. \n\nNow, organic farming is cool and all, but it can be tough. You gotta work way harder to keep the bugs and weeds away without those nasty chemicals. It's like, a full-time job! And sometimes, you lose more stuff than you would with regular farming. But hey, it's good for the planet, right?\n\nSpeaking of the planet, did you know there's this place near Potrero called, like, Chaparral or something? It's got all this stuff like oak trees and grasslands, and it's right next to this giant forest. They're even worried about all these endangered animals living there, like kangaroo rats and frogs and butterflies. \n\nThis land has been around forever, man. Native Americans lived there for ages, then some ranchers came along and started raising cattle. Now, this one dude wants to start an organic farm there, but he needs some help.

            "Alright, so listen up! This whole culture thing is a big deal when you're trying to, you know, get stuff done with other peeps. See, culture ain't just one thing, it's like a whole bag of mixed nuts, ya know? You can't just say \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are chill\" 'cause that's just dumb.  Sure, there are some general ideas about different cultures, but to really get somewhere, you gotta figure out what makes that culture tick.  Like, how do they think, what's important to them, and how will that play out when you're haggling?  \n\nWhen you're meeting people from a different place, you're gonna compare 'em to your own crew, it's natural. But instead of judging 'em, just try to understand where they're coming from. You gotta play by their rules, especially if you're the one not holding all the cards.  Respect their stuff, their ways, their traditions, you know? It'll make things go smoother.\n\nAnd hey, culture ain't just about countries, it's about companies too! Some places are all about long hours and serious business, while others are more laid-back.  Look at how people dress, how they talk, who's in charge, and how they hire folks.  Even in America, places are different! It's like a whole other world sometimes.  \n\nNow, values are the real secret sauce. They're the \"why\" behind the culture. If a place values saving face, you better not go around embarrassing your boss to win a deal.  And if they're all about hard bargaining, don't expect them to back down easy.  You gotta figure this stuff out before you even show up at the table. But hey, don't forget to get to know the people you're dealing with on a personal level too.  That's how you really make a connection and get things done.",
            "So, lemme tell ya about these two dudes, Anselm and Aquinas. They both thought God was the real deal, like, totally, and they both tried to prove it. But they went about it in different ways. Anselm was all about lookin' inside yourself, sayin' that God's gotta exist 'cause ya know it in your bones, like it's just plain true. It's kinda like faith, ya know? You gotta believe it even if you can't see it. \n\nAquinas, on the other hand, was more of a \"show me the proof\" kinda guy. He said we could figure out God exists by lookin' at the world around us, like seein' how things work and how everything's connected. He had these five big ideas, kinda like puzzle pieces, that all fit together to show that God's gotta be there.\n\nNow, both of these guys made some good points, but neither of 'em really blew my mind. It's like, they both had parts of the puzzle, but they weren't quite picture-perfect. You gotta figure out the rest for yourself, ya know?",
            "Whoa, dude! So this dude, Buddha, was born like, way back in the day, like the fifth or sixth century BCE.  He was a prince, but then he ditched all that fancy stuff and went all zen, ya know? He figured out how to escape the crazy cycle of life, death, and rebirth, and his peeps started calling him Buddha, which means \"the awakened one.\" His teachings, they blew everyone's minds and became this big thing called Buddhism. There's this group, the Theravada Buddhists, they're like the OG Buddhists, and they've been around for like, 2,500 years.  \n\nBut get this, Buddhism ain't exactly the same as it was back then. Like, in Sri Lanka, these guys have this crazy water-cutting ceremony, and it's a big deal, but Buddha never mentioned anything about it!  See, over time, Buddhism has changed a lot, from little things like traditions to, like, the big ideas that make up the whole religion.\n\nThink of it like this: Buddhism is like a cool band, right? They started out with a killer sound, but over the years, they've added new instruments, changed some songs, maybe even got a new bass player. It's still the same band, but it's evolved!\n\nSo, to understand this whole thing, we gotta talk about some important words: \"internal forces\" and \"external forces.\"  Internal means stuff that comes from inside the Buddhist community, like monks and lay people. External means anything from, like, outside the church. Now, \"hostile\" forces are like, bad vibes, they try to mess up Buddhism. Benign forces, they don't really care about Buddhism, but sometimes they end up helping or hurting it accidentally.\n\nNow, let's get to the heart of Theravada Buddhism. They believe in the \"Triple Gem\": Buddha, the teachings (the Dhamma), and the community (the Sangha). The Dhamma is like the Buddhist rulebook, it's got all these scriptures called the Tripitaka. It's got stories, rules, and deep philosophical stuff. They talk about Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (life is suffering), and Anicca (everything changes).  \n\nThe whole idea is, if you understand these things, you can escape the cycle of death and rebirth (Sansara) and get rid of desire, hatred, and delusion.  Then, bam! You're enlightened!",
            "'So, you know how Mack keeps sending these crazy robot things after us?' I said, 'Well, lemme tell ya, the US and Mexico kinda did that thing, but with, like, war and stuff. Back in the day, like 1836 to 1893, they were at each other's throats for a solid 57 years! It was intense, man. Like, they fought a whole war, the Mexican-American War, and the US basically took over Texas and the Southwest. Talk about a bad breakup! \n\nSee, they were clashing over all sorts of stuff - religion, culture, you name it. Plus, they both wanted the same land. Kinda like how we're always arguing over who gets the last slice of pizza, but, y'know, on a national level.\n\nIt's not just the US and Mexico, though. Lots of countries that are neighbors have this \"we're better than you\" thing going on. Makes ya wonder, right? \n\nAnyway, the US and Mexico, they were like the ultimate frenemies.  This guy, David Pletcher, said that the US had major problems with Mexico and Cuba, and they were the only ones who really messed with America.  \n\nReligion was a big deal, too. Like, the US was all about \"we do things our way,\" and Mexico was like, \"nah, we got our own thing going on.\" It's kinda like how Cybe and B.B. always argue about video games.\n\nThe whole thing started way back when, with the English and Spanish getting into it.  That kinda messed things up for the US and Mexico from the start.\n\nThey had tons of fights over land and stuff.  It was like a never-ending game of tag, but with guns.  Finally, though, things started to cool down. Mexico needed the US for stuff, and the US realized that taking over more land wasn't the best idea.",
            "Fifteen years ago, boom! This illness I never even knew existed hit me outta nowhere. I was a nurse, ya know?  Always figured it was the safe bet, like my folks told me. \"You'll always have a job, folks always get sick.\" So I went with it, even though my heart was set on science or maybe journalism, heck, both woulda been awesome. But here I am, 46, single, broke, and can't even work. And it's not like it's gonna get better anytime soon. Fifteen years on disability and I've got zip, nada, nothin' left that's really mine.\n\nEvery day is a struggle. It's a punch to the gut, man, to my security, my safety, my whole self-worth.  Nothing's certain anymore, except this: I wouldn't have made it through all this without my family and a few good friends, even though sometimes I feel like a total weakling. 'Cause when disaster strikes, you realize just how weak you really are. \n\nLife throws curveballs, big and small. No matter how much you plan, some stuff just knocks you down.  We gotta stop putting all our faith in the big government, 'cause that ship's sunk, let's be real. \n\nInstead, we gotta learn to trust each other again.  Help each other out, get comfortable asking for help.  We're better off as a pack, not a bunch of loners building their own little fallout shelters. \n\nThose conservatives talk about \"rugged individualism,\" but back in the day, the pioneers didn't make it across the country alone. They made it because they had compassion, respect for each other, and they shared what they had. \n\nSo yeah, be prepared. I am. Got my disaster kit, first aid, water purification, duct tape for the windows, the whole shebang. Flashlights, batteries, candles, canned goods. If you got the space, grow your own food, can it, be self-sufficient.  \n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors!",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this crazy thing called evolution! \n\nSo, scientists have been trying to figure out how critters change over time, like how a plain ol' snail shell turns into a crazy spiral. Back in the day, some dude named D'Arcy Thompson said it was like trying to describe a snowflake with math - tough, right?  Well, nowadays, they're using math to try and figure out how shells grow and change. Think of it like building a shell with math equations!\n\nThese guys took pictures of snail shells and used fancy computer programs to see how different shapes could grow. They're even doing experiments to see how these shapes actually happen. It's like a detective story, trying to figure out the secrets of shell evolution!\n\nSo, imagine a snail's shell like a long, twisty tube. Each twist is called a whorl, and they all spiral around a line called the columella. The shell grows bigger as it goes, and you can see the lines between each whorl called sutures. \n\nNow, there are all sorts of ways to look at a shell - from the top (apical view), the bottom (basal view), the opening (apertural view), and the opposite of that (abapertural view). \n\nThey even have a trick for counting how many whorls there are. You gotta look at the shell from the top and find the first suture. Draw a line down the middle and count the whorls on each side.\n\nThink of it like the snail building its shell one tiny piece at a time. Each piece is like a little door (aperture), and they all stack up in a special way.  They can even use math to see how these doors move and change shape over time. It's wild, right?",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this thing called 'child health' in Indonesia. It ain't lookin' too hot, ya know? For the last ten years, the little ones ain't been doin' so well. Now, Indonesia's got some good stuff goin' on, like clean water and fancy toilets, but when it comes to keepin' babies and moms healthy, they're fallin' behind. We talkin' serious short comin's here!\n\nThey're tryin' to get more folks with fancy medical degrees at birth, which is cool, but some of these 'skilled workers' are just midwives, and when things get hairy, they ain't exactly equipped to handle it. So yeah, that fancy number might look good, but it ain't tellin' the whole story. And guess what? Less kids with tummy aches are seein' a doctor now, which ain't exactly a great sign. \n\nEven gettin' help after the baby's born is a mess. They ain't got enough doctors for that, either. And get this - they ain't doin' enough c-sections, especially out in the sticks. It's like the city folks get all the good stuff, while the poor folks are stuck with nothin'. That ain't right, man! \n\nSo, what's the answer? Should they just focus on one little problem at a time, or should they beef up the whole healthcare system? That's a tough one. \n\nSee, focusin' on one problem is like throwin' a bandaid on a gash. It might stop the bleedin' for a bit, but it ain't gonna fix the whole thing. And if you keep throwin' bandaids on every little thing, you're gonna end up with a whole lotta bandaids and a whole lotta problems.",
            "Alright, so get this: Victorian books are all about being super detailed and talking about fancy folks. But then there's these two books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" that are like, \"Nah, we're gonna do things differently.\" \n\nThese books are all about mystery and weird stuff, which wasn't really a thing in most Victorian books. And that makes the characters way more interesting! It gives you a peek into their heads and why they do the stuff they do.\n\nLike, take this part from \"Oliver Twist\":\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n\nSee, Oliver's having these crazy visions, like dreams or something. He's confused and scared, and it shows us how messed up he feels inside.\n\nBoth \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" use these dream-like scenes to show us what's going on in the characters' minds. In \"Oliver Twist,\" they show us Oliver's pain and how he's starting to understand the world around him. When he gets shot, he relives it over and over in his head, like a bad dream. It shows us how much pain he's in and how helpless he feels.\n\nThe shooting makes you wonder who's really in control, because it's definitely not Oliver.  He's like a puppet, just going along for the ride.  It's like Fagin is breaking him down, making him give up and accept his fate.\n\n\nAnd here's another example from \"Wuthering Heights\"...\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "Couple years back, I was helping out at this after-school program, you know, tutoring those little elementary kids. I was pretty good at English and reading, so that's what I mostly did.  But then this little dude, Adrian, probably in third or fourth grade, came along. He was struggling to read, real bad.  It was weird, though. He'd nail some letters perfectly, then totally botch others.  Made no sense! He spoke perfect English, but something was off.  We were stuck in a rut until one day Adrian's mom came to pick him up.  I'm talking full-on Spanish speaker, zero English.  We managed to make sense of things with my rusty Spanish skills (I was just starting to learn, you know).  And then it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read, just not the English alphabet real well.  I don't know if it helped in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nSee, that story is all about the language barrier in schools, especially here in California.  It shows you that things aren't always as obvious as they seem.  Even if a kid speaks English perfectly, reading it can still be a real pain.  Everyone knows this is a problem, right? So what do we do about it? \n\nFor Adrian, it was simple:  tutoring him in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated.  There's no one magic bullet.  Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes – none of them are the answer on their own.  We gotta combine them all!\n\nDual language programs are a great idea, not just for Spanish speakers, but for everyone!  \"Kids in these programs actually do better in school,\" you know?  There's a lot of fear about them, like they waste resources and don't benefit most kids.  But that's just wrong. If we made them the norm instead of the exception, everyone would win. \n\nHow do we do that? Do we make all teachers bilingual? Nah, that's crazy talk. But we can totally have bilingual helpers, tutors, whatever you want to call them.",
            "Okay, so like, everyone's always talkin' about some big somethin' out there, right?  Some kinda super-duper somethin' bigger than us, bigger than our whole heads can even wrap around. Some folks go to church or temple or whatever to figure it out, but some of us are all, \"Nah, man, there's nothin' beyond me and my own little world.\"  We might believe in one thing for a while, then bam!  We change our minds and find somethin' else.  It's all about findin' our own way, you know?  Like, we're all searchin' for a freakin' light in the dark, somethin' to guide us outta the shadows and into the sunshine.\n\nMy dad, he was a smoker. We'd sit on the porch, rain poundin' on the roof like a drum solo, and just puff away.  He was lookin' kinda thin, clothes saggin' on him, hair like a bad wig.  He'd stare out at the rain, kinda lost in thought.  I wanted to talk to him, but I was scared.  Scared to say what I was thinkin', scared of makin' it all real.  So I just hugged him, sat closer, and stared at the rain with him.\n\nMy dad, he kicked the bucket in December, a few days after my 22nd birthday.  The chemo and all that stuff didn't really help, just kept him around longer than the doctors thought.  I dunno, what was the point of that?  What kinda jerk God would do that?  Honestly, I didn't pray.  If there was a God out there, He'd stopped listenin' to me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't wanna watch him die.  Couldn't watch the guy who made me disappear.  I wanted to remember him for how he lived, not how he died.  I knew him better than anyone, better than even his family.  I knew he wouldn't want me sittin' there like a creep, watchin' him die.  So I just curled up in bed for three days, waitin' for the news.\n\nNo one even had the decency to call.",
            "Alright, listen up! The whole \"Gothic Novel\" thing is kinda whack, ya know? Like, it's called \"Gothic\" but it's all about this old-timey stuff mixed with somethin' new. This dude, Ian Watt,  said it best: a real oxymoron, like \"jumbo shrimp\"! Some folks think it's garbage, others think it's deep as the ocean. They've called it everything from boring to totally awesome for how creepy it gets.  \n\nSo, this first \"Gothic Novel,\"  *The Castle of Otranto* by Horace Walpole,  it's like the OG of the whole shebang. It takes those old-school stories, like the ones from ancient times, and mixes 'em with the newfangled way of writing novels, ya dig?  Walpole throws in some stage stuff and tries to make it all sound real life-like. He calls it a \"Gothic Story,\" and it's all about castles and spooky stuff. \n\nBack then,  \"Gothic\" meant all sorts of things -  like,  people, styles, even time periods. It was kinda like saying \"old-fashioned\" or \"not cool\" compared to the new, modern stuff. But here's the kicker: combining that \"Gothic\" vibe with the new way of writing novels, where you get inside the characters' heads,  that's what keeps it going for so long. It's like, both old and new at the same time!\n\nOne big thing in Gothic stories is **Chivalry**.  Remember those knights in shining armor?  Well, Gothic writers loved that idea. It was all about being brave, honorable, and a total badass.  But they also thought that real life wasn't like that anymore.  So they used chivalric stuff, like knights and castles, to make the past seem better than the present. \n\nWalpole wrote *The Castle of Otranto* during a time when things were kinda messed up politically. He was worried about the future and thought maybe people weren't as good as they used to be. In his story, you see this idea with a character named Frederic.  He's described as a prince who's been through some tough stuff and is supposed to be dead.  He's basically the perfect knight, but he's also a bit over-the-top, which is kinda hilarious.  It's like, he's the ideal knight, but taken to the extreme.",
            "Alright, check it out, cuz this is how the whole supply chain thing works! It's like a crazy rollercoaster ride for stuff, from the moment someone wants somethin' to when it finally lands in their hands. Back in '82, this dude named Keith Oliver came up with the fancy name \"supply chain management.\" He was basically sayin', \"Yo, we gotta plan this whole shebang - makin' the stuff, gettin' the stuff, movin' the stuff - to make sure everyone's happy and gettin' what they need, like, yesterday!\" \n\nSo, there are these six key players in this whole supply chain game: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and info.  Think of 'em like the members of a super-cool band. Each one has a role to play, and if one's off beat, the whole thing falls apart.\n\nFirst up, we got production - that's where the magic happens! Figuring out what to make, how much, and where, that's the boss move.  Managers gotta be like detectives, sniffin' out what people want. They gotta watch the market, see what's hot, what's not, and make sure they're makin' somethin' everyone's gonna go bananas for.\n\nThen there's supply, which is like the muscle of the operation. Managers gotta figure out where to get all the stuff they need to build their products. They might have different factories for different parts, or they might outsource some stuff to other companies.  It's all about makin' things move fast and smooth, while keepin' the prices low. \n\nThe rest of the players, inventory (keepin' track of all that stuff), location (findin' the best place to make and ship things), transportation (gettin' it all where it needs to go), and info (keepin' everyone in the loop), they all work together to make sure the whole thing runs like a well-oiled machine.\n\nMake sense? Pretty cool, huh?",
            "Hold on, lemme tell ya somethin'. So there's this chick, Ellen Page, ya know, the one from Juno? She's standin' on a corner, holdin' up this cardboard sign. It's got a crazy message scribbled on it with a Sharpie, somethin' about Hitler bein' alive in Burma. Burma, it's also called Myanmar, and it's ruled by these super mean guys, a junta, who took over back in '62.  \n\nSo, back in '07, people in Burma started protestin', like, for real. It was the first time in ages they'd done somethin' like that. Monks, wearin' their saffron robes, led the way, and that's how it got called the \"Saffron Revolution.\" At first, the government was like, \"Whatever,\" let the monks hang out, but then things got outta hand. It turned into a full-blown fight between the monks and the junta, with the army bustin' into monasteries and stuff.  They even threw journalists in jail, and one guy, a Japanese photographer named Kenji, got killed just for bein' there. They say 13 people died, but some guy who ditched the army said it was way more, like, thousands.\n\nThis ain't nothin' new, though. Governments tryin' to shut down anyone who disagrees with 'em has always been a thing.  Remember those Roman emperors? They acted like they were chosen by the gods to rule everything.  And don't even get me started on the Japanese emperors, they think they're gods themselves! And here we have our own president, Bush, chattin' it up with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, which is like, part of the Republican Party. \n\nThere are all these other times this stuff has happened, like that Tiananmen Square protest in 1989, where students and activists got together to say \"no more\" to the government. The Chinese government said 200-300 died, but others say it was like 2,000-3,000. And then there's the Rwandan genocide, where Hutu guys killed all the Tutsis and anyone who wasn't with them.  And let's not forget Hitler and the Holocaust, where they rounded up all the Jews and, well, you know...",
            "Duke Ellington was a big cheese in the jazz world 'cause he stuck around forever and kept making awesome music with his band. Now, you might not hear him wailin' on the piano a whole lot in some of his tunes, but man, this dude was a genius at writing songs that showed off everyone's talent. He'd set the stage for soloists to go wild, AND he'd write super tight arrangements with parts just made for each guy in the band. That's how he made his sound so unique - he knew how to blend all those different flavors into somethin' fresh and exciting. \n\nThe folks over at Grove Music, they say Ellington was like a wizard with voices. Take his song \"Creole Love Call\" - he used voices like instruments, all smooth and jazzy, even without singin' words. He was always findin' ways to make his soloists shine, and \"Creole Love Call\" is a perfect example. It's a slow bluesy tune with six different parts, each one buildin' on the last:\n\n* **Part 1:**  A back-and-forth between a voice and the woodwinds, startin' sweet and mellow, then gettin' rougher towards the end.\n\n* **Part 2:**  A trumpet solo with a muted sound, makin' the melody stretch out and adding some bluesy bends.\n\n* **Part 3:**  A clarinet takes center stage, soaring high up with a piano riff underneath, all snappy and syncopated.\n\n* **Part 4:** The whole band jumps in, echoin' the first part with brass and reeds takin' turns.\n\n* **Part 5:**  This one's the climax! The woodwinds start the call-and-response high up, while the brass and rhythm section playin' a stoppin' and startin' groove.\n\n* **Part 6:**  Back to the first part, but this time the voice gets all growly and soulful, soloin' like an instrument.\n\n* **Ending:** A quick tag with some fancy vocal runs and a trombone doin' somethin' unexpected and cool.\n\nEllington loved usin' voices to add that extra somethin' special to his music, and he did it all over the place. \n\nIn another song called \"Hot and Bothered,\" he gets all fancy with his arrangements, and uses a call-and-response between a muted trumpet player and a scat singer. They're blendin' their sounds so well, the trumpet sounds like a voice and the voice sounds like an instrument - pure magic! And in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" he features a guy named Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, playin' a muted trombone that just grabs you with the melody.",
            "She was always lookin' for somethin', this big hole inside her that nothin' seemed to fill. It started way back when she was 14, just hittin' that teenage groove, and it was still there three years later, at 17. Now, she figured it wasn't a thing she needed, but someone.  But dude, no boys had ever grabbed her attention. Some tried, you know, the whole clumsy wooin' thing, but nothin'. She'd wrack her brain tryin' to figure it out, what kinda messed up mojo made a girl like that, but nothin' clicked. So she just kept rollin' with it, always wonderin'.\n\nHer life at home was usually pretty chill. Her folks were cool cats, never fightin' and rarely yellin', even at her. They only ever butted heads when she was tryin' to spread her wings and do her own thing. She was their kid, yeah, but totally opposite vibes. They were mellow, she was a freakin' firework. Still, everyone loved her.\n\nBut this day was anything but chill. She was wanderin' around, tryin' to spark some inspiration for somethin', when BAM! She heard her mom scream from the kitchen. Heart poundin', she raced in, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mom was sprawled on the floor, makin' little \"ow\" sounds. This chick was in trouble.  She rushed to her side, \"Mom, tell me where to take ya.\"  \"Ow... sweetie...  hospital...\"  Her voice was all crackly. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to meet you.\"  Her mom pointed, and she was thankful she'd taken those self-defense classes. She hefted her mom, tossed her in the back seat, and hit the gas.\n\nThe hospital smelled like bleach and sickness, but she couldn't even notice, too busy focusin' on her mom. She practically dragged her inside, yellin' for help. A bunch of worried faces swarmed, and someone whipped up a gurney, strapped her mom down, and whisked her away. Now she was stuck waitin', anxiety gnawin' at her.\n\nTurns out, her mom had fallen off a step stool reachin' for a fancy vase.",
            "So, gather 'round, folks, and lemme tell ya about this study they did. See, they wanted to know if this fancy \"Mediterranean Diet\" (they call it Med diet for short) could help keep your ticker in tip-top shape. Turns out, this Med diet is all about munchin' on good stuff like fruits, veggies, nuts, and fish, while keepin' the red meat and greasy stuff to a minimum. A little vino is okay too, but don't go overboard! \n\nNow, they already knew this Med diet was good for ya, but nobody had really looked at how it helped with heart attacks or strokes. So, they got this big group of nurses, over 70,000 of 'em, and asked 'em about what they ate every year for 20 years. They made sure to track all the juicy details, like exercise, smokin', and even if they took vitamins.\n\nAfter all that time, they found out that the nurses who ate the most Med-style were way less likely to have a heart attack or a stroke. It's like, the more they chowed down on that healthy stuff, the less likely they were to end up in the hospital. Pretty cool, huh?",
            "Okay, so back in 2007,  America totally crashed harder than Mack's last robot creation.  You know, the one with the disco ball and the flamethrower?  Yeah, this was a whole other level of messed up.  Jobs disappeared faster than Foxy after a free pizza buffet, and houses were worth less than a chewed-up sock.  Even the big, fancy companies were going, \"Uh oh, we're outta here!\" It's still kinda a mess, so let me tell ya, something went wrong.  Big time.  \n\nTurns out, those fancy pants politicians made some really dumb decisions. They pushed banks to give out loans to anyone, even if they couldn't afford 'em.  It was like giving B.B. a credit card and telling him to buy candy.  Disaster waiting to happen!  And these places called Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they were like, \"Let's take these risky loans and make 'em into something shiny and new!\"  They called it a \"mortgage-backed security\" or something.  Sounds fancy, right?  Turns out, it was just a fancy way of saying, \"We're gonna gamble with your money!\"\n\nNow, this whole mess started back in the Clinton days.  Remember when he was president?  He wanted to look good, so he made it easier to get loans.  Seemed like a good idea at the time, but it was like setting a box of dynamite on the couch.  One spark and boom!  \n\nThen they started making these mortgages that changed interest rates like a chameleon changes colors.  And they bundled them all up into these big, complicated things called CDOs.  It was like a house of cards, except made of debt.  And guess what?  The cards fell.  People couldn't pay their loans, the banks were broke, and the whole economy went kablooey!   The big banks?  They lost tons of money.  Even the government had to step in and save the day, but it cost a whole lot of dough.  So yeah, that's the story of the financial crisis.  A bunch of bad decisions, some fancy-sounding words, and a whole lotta chaos.",
            "Okay, so, exposition. That part in your story where you're supposed to dazzle everyone with your writing, right?  The part where readers either get hooked or click away faster than you can say \"character development.\"  Even Dr. Merlin, the awesome writer, has been known to yell at her computer screen when she gets stuck in a boring, info-dumping mess.\n\nBelieve me, exposition is not your friend.\n\nWe all know \"Show, don't tell,\" but sometimes Dr. Merlin (and maybe even you!) gets carried away with too much telling.  It's like that little voice in your head whispering, \"Get all the backstory out of the way so we can get to the good stuff!\"  But that voice can be a real pain. \n\nThink of exposition like the character who tells everyone everything at once, like a walking encyclopedia.  It's the equivalent of someone saying, \"Oh, by the way, this princess was raised in a tower, she has a talking animal sidekick, and her evil stepmother tried to kill her – but let's get to the exciting part!\"\n\nHere's a classic example: You're reading a story and you're told the heroine met her soulmate, got married in a fancy ceremony, and then her husband was murdered right in front of her.  You wouldn't want the whole story of their love to take up two pages of dialogue-less descriptions.  You want to see their love, feel it, understand it!

First up, this dude Shad Hostettler, stabbed his wife, Ashley, Ohio, messed up real bad. They showed his mug shot – looked like a total jerk. They only gave it about two minutes, though. Said he stabbed her a bunch of times. They caught the creep, so that's good. \n \nNext up, young Travis Buyers, 18, shot down in Sharon Woods. Real bad shape, no arrests yet, SWAT team on the case. Seemed kinda rushed, like they didn't wanna talk about it too much. Kinda makes you wonder if it's 'cause he was black, ya know? 'Cause when it's a white kid, the whole town freaks out. But when it's a minority, it's like, whatever.  \n \nThen they had a story about a bullet hole in a Med-Flight helicopter.  .22 caliber, rifle shot. They were lookin' for the shooter, Crime-Stoppers offerin' five grand for tips. \n \nRain and heat comin' Saturday, they said. Short story, just a tease to keep ya watchin'.  \n \nThen a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. They described the robber as a tall, skinny, dark-skinned black dude in a hoodie. Seemed like they were really playin' up his race, which is kinda weird. \n \nLast one was about Rene Rodriguez, this Texas drug kingpin.  They called him a \"Hispanic man\" which, come on, really? Anyway, he got 300 months in prison, which is 25 years, but they said it like that to make it sound scarier, I guess.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya about brothers, man. It's like, there's this crazy connection, ya know? It's like a messed up rollercoaster of emotions, all tangled up together.  There's love, sure, but also pride, jealousy, and even straight-up meanness. Brothers get each other like nobody else, man. It's like lookin' in a mirror, seein' yourself, but messed up and twisted. \n\nWhen things get rough, that's when the real deal comes out. It's either gonna be good or bad, no in-between.  And let me tell ya, all this brotherly stuff, it comes with a price. It ain't all sunshine and roses.\n\nThis whole brother thing, man, it's about seein' your reflection in another person, not just how people see you, but the real you, the good and the bad. \n\nThis story, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" it's all about this, ya know? These two brothers, they're messin' around in this crazy, beautiful place, but it's all going south fast. Pride and disappointment, it's like a bomb ready to go off.  In the end, only one brother makes it out alive.  \n\nIt's all about how the main guy feels, and how he sees himself and his brother. You can see it in his actions, in the things he does and the stuff that happens because of it. That's what makes him who he is.",
            "Yo, check it! The brain, it's like, super complex, ya know? It's all about taking in info and making stuff up like a mad scientist. Back in the day, people thought it was like a wax tablet, then papyrus, then a book, and now they're sayin' it's like a computer. But hold up, those are just comparisons, see? They don't tell the whole story, so don't go gettin' all hung up on 'em.\n\nSo, your senses, they're like the input, right? They grab stuff from the world - touch, sound, light, heat - and turn it into signals the brain can understand. Then, the brain, it's like a crazy party, with all these signals gettin' passed around and changed up. Like, when you see a box on a white background, your brain starts piecing together the colors, shapes, edges, all that jazz. That's bottom-up processing, man.  But then, your brain also uses what it already knows - like \"boxes are usually solid\" - to figure out what it's lookin' at faster. That's top-down processing, like a shortcut.\n\nNow, the brain's got this thing called attention, think of it like a bouncer at a club. It decides what's important and lets some signals in while shooing others away. You see a million blades of grass, but you don't notice each one individually, right? That's attention filterin' out the noise. But your name? BAM! That gets through the bouncer like you're on the guest list.\n\nBut hold up, before we can do anything with info, we gotta store it. There's short-term memory, kinda like a notepad, and long-term memory, the big ol' filing cabinet.  Short-term memory holds stuff for a few seconds, and they think it's like electrical signals buzzin' around in your brain. Long-term memory, well, that's a mystery, but they think it's stored in the way proteins are built.\n\nThere are tons of theories about how our brain organizes all this knowledge, like maps and networks. One idea is that concepts are like nodes, connected by how related they are. So \"chair\" is linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "Sa2b here. So, check it out. This dude Huxley wrote this story, \"Brave New World,\" and it's totally messed up, man. He's like, \"Whoa, technology and all this money stuff is gonna be our downfall!\"  \n\nSee, in this story, everyone's all happy-happy, but they're like robots, man. They're told to be happy all the time and just go with the flow. No thinking, no real feelings, just instant gratification. It's like they're hypnotized by this guy in charge, the World Controller, who's basically the big cheese.\n\nHuxley was onto something, though. Remember how Marx talked about how everyone gets tricked into thinking they're doing good when they're just working for the man?  That's totally what's happening here. The people are so obsessed with stuff and being happy that they don't even realize they're being manipulated. It's like they're in a trance.\n\nHe's using this thing called \"false consciousness,\"  where people are basically too busy trying to get the next shiny thing to see what's really going on. They're like, \"Gimme, gimme!\" and the World Controller is like, \"Sure, here you go, but don't ask questions!\"\n\nAnd get this - the rich guys know what's up, but they just let it happen. They're like, \"Yeah, we're in charge, and they're fine with it.\"  It's messed up, man.\n\nHuxley also shows how people just don't connect with each other anymore. They're so focused on themselves and their stuff that they don't even have real relationships. It's all superficial, like a bunch of robots going through the motions.\n\nHe's basically saying that technology and capitalism are killing our humanity.  It's a wake-up call, man.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya, this whole campus thing is a real trip. Been here for two and a half years, four and a half semesters, and let me tell ya, getting around this place can be a real pain in the tail feathers. Freshman year, I got stuck in East Halls, which is like, a million miles from everywhere else.  I mean, to get to Willard building, which is practically in the middle of campus, it could take me 25 minutes just walkin', and that’s if the weather's decent.  State College weather, man, it's like a roller coaster itself!  \n\nTalked to an old grad, not too much older than me, and he said things used to be even worse. Back in the day, East Halls was like its own little island, surrounded by nothin' but empty fields. Now, they've built all these new sports fields, fancy buildings like the Creamery and that new health center, and apartments everywhere. It's like they just keep buildin' and buildin', but nobody thinks about how to get around.\n\nSo, what's the answer to this campus traffic jam? Bikes, baby! But it's not just about havin' the bike, you gotta have a campus that works for cyclists.\n\nMy buddy, he got back into ridin' after a few years off, and he was like, \"Man, I can't believe I ever stopped. Bikes are the only way to go!\"  They're good for ya, too, healthy and all that jazz. Plus, you can go far on a tank of oatmeal and a little leg power. \n\nI live off-campus now, 'bout as far from the center as some dorms, but I bought a bike this year and it was the best decision ever. My classes are in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk, but on my bike, it's like, 5 minutes if I crank it up.  \n\nOf course, Pollock Road, the closest route, can be a real hazard, but hey, what can ya do? Sometimes you gotta ride through the madness.  Walkin' ain't bad, but I'm always on the go.  Without my bike, I'd be walkin' to class, appointments, everywhere, and that's just too much time lost. That's like, two and a half hours a week, man!"

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "So listen up, 'cause Sa2b's about to lay some truth on ya! See, I'm thinkin' about goin' full-on social worker, helpin' out those lil' rugrats who've had a rough go of it, ya know?  And maybe lend a hand to families that are, let's say, seein' some tough times. Now, lemme tell ya, I'm all about servin' others, treatin' everyone with respect, and doin' the right thing, ya dig? That ain't just some social worker mumbo jumbo, that's how I roll in life.\n\nTruth be told, I've always wanted to make a difference, but didn't know exactly how.  Back in high school and college, I saw folks tryin' to run from their problems, doin' some real whack stuff to cope. It made me wanna do somethin'.  I even got myself a psychology degree, but still wasn't sure what path to take. \n\nThen one summer, I met this kid, sixteen years old and lookin' all nervous. My buddy was takin' care of him 'cause he was runnin' from his abusive parents. Turns out, the kid called the cops on 'em! So I figured I'd lend a hand. I talked to the cops, told 'em I was a recent grad, and they asked me to talk to the parents. Let me tell ya, those folks were shifty! They were all nervous and makin' excuses about their son bein' a manipulator. After that, I knew right then and there I wanted to be a social worker, helpin' kids like that get the support they need.\n\nAnd another thing that's really important to me is social justice. Society always goes on about how special each individual is, but then they try to make us all the same.  It's like, if we're all so unique, why are we always tryin' to fit in?  I'm unique, and I ain't gonna apologize for it! Through high school and college, I stood up for what's right whenever I could: dyed my hair crazy colors, wore what I wanted, pierced my ears, joined the Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance, fought against racism and discrimination whenever I saw it.  I believe in standin' up for what's right, and I'll keep doin' it!",
            "Okay, so check it out. This paper wants to break down insomnia, you know, that whole not-sleeping thing.  It's lookin' at two main ways people think about it: the biology side and the social/cultural side.  \n\nOn the biology side, they're talkin' genes, family history, and all that stuff that's, like, hard-wired into your body. Like, maybe you got a messed up gene that messes with your sleep.  They're also talkin' about how our brains work, especially this part called the hypothalamus. It's like the sleep-wake control center.\n\nThe social/cultural side is all about your environment, like where you live, who you hang with, and how much money you got.  They think these things can totally affect your sleep too.\n\nThis paper looks at a bunch of studies, like, real science stuff, to see if these models, the biology and the social stuff, actually make sense. They even point out the good and bad parts of each study.  \n\nFirst, they talk about different types of sleep problems. Like, insomnia (can't fall asleep), hypersomnia (too much sleep), narcolepsy (falling asleep randomly), and nightmares. Then they get specific about insomnia.\n\nThey found this one study where they messed with mice brains and found that these receptors called GABAB receptors play a big role in sleep.  Like, if you mess with these receptors, you mess with sleep. They think this might be true for humans too.\n\nSo, if you have a messed up GABAB receptor, maybe that's why you can't sleep. And that's where the social stuff comes in. If you're poor or stressed out or whatever, it could make your sleep problems even worse.",
            "Alright, so check it out, this thing called CAPD, it's like when your brain's not quite getting the message from your ears, you know? It's not that you can't hear, it's more like your brain's having trouble figuring out what it's hearing.  \n\nThink of it like this: You hear a bunch of sounds, like a bunch of people talking and music playing, but your brain's getting mixed up trying to figure out who's saying what and what's going on.  \n\nThey've been figuring out how to spot this stuff for a while now, back in the '50s, people started noticing kids who had trouble understanding what they heard.  They figured out some tests to see if someone's brain was having trouble with sounds, like trying to pick out words from a bunch of noise or telling the difference between similar sounds.\n\nCAPD can show up in a bunch of different ways.  Some folks might have trouble telling where a sound is coming from, or they might struggle to understand what someone's saying if there's a lot of background noise.  Some people might have trouble understanding jokes or sarcasm because their brain's not picking up on the changes in someone's voice. \n\nTo figure out if someone has CAPD, they do a bunch of tests, like listening for sounds, figuring out what words they hear, or paying attention to changes in sounds.\n\nThe tricky part is that there's no single test that's perfect for diagnosing CAPD. And even though they've been studying it for a while, they still don't know exactly what causes it.",
            "So, Shakespeare's play, Twelfth Night, kinda says that while pretending to be someone else can work for a while, eventually ya gotta ditch the fake identity or you might lose yourself completely. But here's the catch: tellin' people the truth can mess things up bad. Some folks might not care that they were fooled, but others could get real mad and feel hurt.  It's like, do you protect yourself or your relationships?\n\nGender disguises make this whole thing even trickier. Why would someone wanna hide who they really are and pretend to be the opposite gender?  Well, in Viola's case, it's all about safety. She's a newbie in this new land, and she figures she's safer as a dude. \"I'll introduce you to a captain in this town/ Where my girl clothes are kept, thanks to his kindness/ I was saved to serve this noble count.” (5.1.247-249)\n\nBut here's the thing: pretending to be a guy cuts her off from other women, who could be a good support system. And get this, she's so good at it that Olivia,  this rich lady, falls head over heels for \"Cesario,\" thinking he's a dude! \"Stay, my lord, Cesario, husband.\" (5.1.138)  Not to mention, she has these feelings for Orsino, who's totally smitten with her, but thinks she's a dude.  \"Boy, you've told me a thousand times/ You must never love a woman like me.\" (5.1. 260-261)\n\nTwelfth Night is like a mirror reflecting how pretending can bring hidden feelings to the surface. Olivia and Orsino might be dealing with stuff they didn't even know they felt. Maybe Olivia's attracted to Cesario because he looks like a guy, or maybe she secretly likes women?  It's hard to say.  But Shakespeare seems to be poking fun at how people back then judged folks based on looks alone.  Olivia switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian (Viola's twin brother) super quick, and treats Cesario like family, not a love interest: “Sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "Alright, so ya know how everyone's always sayin' the Germans were real rough on the natives back in the day? Like, total bad guys?  Well, true enough, especially in South West Africa where they went overboard with the whole \"killin' everyone\" thing. But hold your horses, it wasn't all bad everywhere. Germany ran a bunch of colonies, and each one was different, kinda like how some folks in your family are total weirdos while others are kinda cool. \n\nWhen the Brits took over German East Africa (that's Tanganyika now), they were surprised to find a bunch of smart Africans who could read and write. Turns out, the Germans actually did a decent job in some places, like Kamerun. But South West Africa? That's where things got weird. \n\nUnlike in East Africa where the government built schools and stuff for the locals, in South West Africa, they kinda just shrugged and said, \"Hey, missionaries, you take care of it.\"  They threw a little bit of money their way, but not much. Meanwhile, they went hog wild building schools for the white folks, like they were the only ones who mattered. This messed things up big time in South West Africa, even after the Germans packed their bags.  While other colonies had plenty of smart, educated Africans, South West Africa was left behind.\n\nSo what happened? Why was South West Africa so different? Well, a bunch of stuff, like the people who lived there, the government, and the economy. This paper is gonna dig into all that and see what we can figure out.\n\nThere's a ton of stuff written about German schools in their colonies. Most of it's in German and was written way back when they were running the show. Back then, people were mostly just tryin' to figure out what these schools were like. Later, some folks in English started comparing the schools in different colonies and lookin' closer at specific parts of them. They found that each colony was different, just like I said.\n\nOne guy, Cohen, wrote a whole book about schools in South West Africa and East Africa. He compared them and figured out why they were so different. He thinks the big population of white folks in South Africa had a lot to do with it.\n\nSouth West Africa wasn't as hot and humid as some of the other German colonies, although it was pretty dry and desert-y.  That meant more white folks wanted to live there. By 1913, almost 15,000 white folks lived there, compared to only 5,000 in East Africa, which was the next most populated colony.",
            "Yo, check it!  Music's gone wild over the last 100 years, man. So many styles now, it's a freakin' jungle out there. You got your rock, your rap, your country, your jazz, your folk, and then, bam! Sub-genres popping up like mushrooms after a rainstorm. \n\nBut hold up, let's talk about Heavy Metal, the real deal. It's been shredding faces for 40 years, and it's like a whole universe of its own. It's all about those dark vibes, ya know? Anger, angst, the whole nine yards. But it's also super diverse, man. People took that heavy sound and twisted it into a million different directions. Sub-genres upon sub-genres, it's like a never-ending game of musical chairs.\n\nNow, it's so crazy out there in metal land, it's hard to say what even defines it anymore. It's borrowed from everywhere, but it all started somewhere, right?  To get the full picture, you gotta understand what metal's REALLY about, why it's a movement, not just a genre. \n\nMetal's all about that darkness, man. It's like a sonic scream into the void. More bass, more volume, more intensity, more everything! It's like a big middle finger to the mainstream.  Metalheads are serious musicians too, they're all about chops and skill. And let's be real, drugs have always been a big part of the scene. Back in the 70s, those psychedelic trips fueled some seriously wild music. It's all about pushing boundaries, man, exploring the dark side of life,  and letting those emotions flow.\n\nEven those old Romantic poets, they knew about that darkness, and metal bands have definitely picked up on that vibe. Lyrics like these:\n\n[Insert lyrics here]\n\nSee, that's the heart of metal. It's raw, it's honest, it's unapologetically dark.",
            "Alright, picture this: way before those fancy Surrealist dudes started painting their crazy dreams, there was this artist named Henri Rousseau, and he was busy dreamin' up his own world, both on canvas and in his head. One of his paintings, called \"The Dream,\" shows a lady checkin' out some wild stuff in a dreamland. But get this, it's not just about the dream, it's about Rousseau's own dreams, ya know? He wanted to be famous, to have other artists and art lovers dig his stuff. But here's the catch: he had this big struggle goin' on inside him. Should he paint like everyone else to fit in with the fancy art crowd, or should he just do his own thing and be different? \"The Dream\" kinda sums up this whole dilemma he had.\n\nBefore we dive deeper, let me tell ya a bit about this guy Rousseau. Born way back in 1844, he wasn't some rich art kid. His dad was a hardware guy, and Rousseau worked for the government collectin' tolls for years. He never went to art school, not even once! He was like, forty years old before he decided to paint. Even worse, his first wife and most of his kids died, so he was heartbroken. Painting became his escape, his way to start fresh.  \n\nSo, Rousseau wanted to be a big shot in the art world, and it makes sense why. He was a late bloomer, didn't have any fancy training, and all these other talented artists were gettin' all the attention.  He was tryin' hard, but folks weren't really seein' what he was doin'.  It wasn't until Matisse started makin' a name for himself that Rousseau finally started gettin' some recognition.  This guy Gordon, who wrote a book about French painters, said that Rousseau and Matisse were different in every way. Matisse was all about bein' unique, while Rousseau just wanted to paint something so classic that the art world would finally accept him.",
            "So, like, a bunch of really smart peeps think that  being good and looking good are totally connected, ya know? Like, they're like besties.  It's like what Keats said in his poem about that fancy old urn: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - That's all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We learn a lot from school and stuff, but we just *get* good and good-looking stuff without anyone telling us, ya know? Both good stuff and pretty stuff are all about explaining why something is good or pretty, not like, making rules for how to be good or make pretty things.\n\nThink about it, when someone's all, \"This painting is amazing!\" they can talk about stuff like colors and stuff, but it's still not the whole story. It's like, \"There's just something about it!\"  \n\nLike, even when we try to explain why something's good,  it's like, there's this extra somethin' somethin' we can't quite put our finger on. It's like O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way.\"\n\nEthics and art, they both have this extra somethin' somethin' that makes them super powerful. It's like a vibe, ya know? Like, we feel it in our gut, but can't explain it with words.\n\nAnd books, man, they're even more intense because they're all about values, like, what's important in life.  McKean said it best: \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\"",
            "Germany today is a real powerhouse, a country united with its own unique culture. It's like, picture this: you've got Munich, all high-tech and fancy in the Bavarian Alps, and then you got Kiel by the Baltic Sea, chillin' with its own vibe.  It's the same kinda cool feeling you get from Cologne on the Rhine River, all the way through the middle of Germany to Dresden, that fancy city on the Elbe. With so much going on, it's no wonder Germany's culture is a mix of everything, a melting pot from different tribes and stuff. \n\nBack in the day, this land was called Germania, and where the name came from? Well, that's a whole mystery! Some say this dude Tacitus, a history guy, thought it came from a tribe called the Tungrians, who were, like, the OG Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought with Gaulish dudes. Julius Caesar, the Roman guy who conquered Gaul, was the first to use the word \"Germanus\" to talk about the tribes he didn't conquer, like, \"those guys are Germans, they're different from the Gauls I beat.\" Some think it came from the Gauls themselves, kinda like a label to say \"these guys are not us!\"  Others think it came from their spears, called \"ger,\" or maybe from the old Irish word \"garim\" which means \"to shout,\" 'cause, you know, Germans were loud!\n\nTacitus, the Roman dude from way back, wrote this book called \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" in 98 AD, all about where the Germans came from. He said that they were like, the original inhabitants, not mixed with anyone else. He thought nobody in their right mind would leave Asia or Africa for Germany, unless, like, it was their home!\n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Not a chance! The Romans would send out their troops to get stuff and wage war, but they mostly stayed in their big empire.  But those Germanic tribes kept popping up, living on the borders of the Roman Empire. They traded their goods and even served in the Roman army, which was pretty cool.",
            "Down there, the porcelain throne stared back at me.  My brain, man, it was just... vacant.  Like, I saw the mess, but it wasn't really *seeing* it, ya know?  Thoughts popped up, like bubbles in a murky pond, then vanished just as fast.  It was like watching a movie,  but I wasn't really in it.\n\nSo, I got this book once, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  Always wanted to draw, since I was a kid.  This book, it's all about how your brain  sees stuff, you know,  like,  how a pencil is more than just a stick.  One trick it teaches is to put a square around whatever you're looking at.  Like, if you're looking at a bowl of fruit, bam!  Square.  Suddenly it's not this giant, overwhelming thing, just the bowl of fruit.\n\nBut here I was, staring at this...thing...and I couldn't even mentally put that square down.  I was  mesmerized, man.  Picasso had his blue phase, Monet loved his greens, those Renaissance guys, they were all about the color explosion.  Me?  I was staring at my own brown masterpiece.   \n\nMy hand hovered over the toilet brush, muscles tense, ready to strike.  It was like the start of a masterpiece, you know?  Water swirling, smooth and clear,  little bits of...stuff...floating away.  But then, my hand jerked, panicked.  The thing wouldn't budge.  Stuck fast, like a bad dream.\n\nMop in one hand, tie choking me out, I glared at the brown mess. Someone's \"art project.\"  A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet contemplation, then I reached for the toilet paper.  Wrapped it around my hand like a freaking oven mitt.  Straight up, then bent over, my hand dipped into the bowl.  Like a mom checking the turkey, except way less delicious.",
            "Yo! So, get this, teenagers are like, totally crashing their cars left and right. It's like, a major bummer, you know? Apparently, their brains ain't fully cooked yet for all the crazy stuff that happens on the road. Plus, they're like, super inexperienced.  Think about it: they're more likely to, like, smash their cars, flip 'em over, zoom way too fast, or even drive right off the road!\n\nAnd get this, things get even worse when they've got their buddies in the car. Like, duh, that's what they do, right? But seriously, it makes stuff way more dangerous. Some brainiacs in California figured this out, and they're all, \"Hey, maybe we should make things harder for teens to drive.\" So, they came up with this thing called a \"provisional license\" – basically, limited driving hours and no passengers under a certain age. Sounds kinda lame, right?\n\nBut here's the deal: It ain't really solving the problem.  This one psychologist dude, Marvin Zuckerman, says even 18 is too young to be driving because teens just crave that adrenaline rush, ya know?  They're all about taking risks for the thrill.  So, maybe we should just wait a few more years until they chill out a bit before they get behind the wheel. \n\nIf we keep letting teens drive, it's gonna be a real mess.  Like, a whole lot of accidents and people getting hurt.  It's not gonna be pretty, especially with all those baby boomers' kids hitting the road soon.\n\nWe need to do something about it, man!  Schools can still teach 'em how to drive, but no one under 18 should be allowed on the road.  They can get a temporary permit and practice with an adult, but no solo driving until they're older.\n\nIt's gotta be a national thing, too, so everyone's on the same page. It's not rocket science, right?",
            "So, I was checking out all these old Edison films at the Library of Congress. You know, those super early ones? I found fifteen trick films from way back when, between 1895 and 1901.  These films are all about using clever editing to pull off crazy illusions. I mainly looked at how they did that in most of the films and  noticed a few that were a little different, pushing the boundaries.\n\nMost of these trick films were pretty basic. They stuck to the same setup every time: a stage-like set, the camera just hanging out in one spot, no fancy camera moves, and long shots, like you're looking at a whole scene at once. They also stuck to this rule: one shot, one film.  No messing around with cutting between different shots.\n\nBut then, there were a few films that started to sneak in some stuff like multiple shots, which was pretty wild for the time!  \n\nOne thing all these films had in common was this set-up. Imagine a stage with a curtain at the front. That's basically what these films looked like. The camera wouldn't move, it just stayed put, like a front-row seat at a show. This was super common back then, especially for magic shows and vaudeville. The problem was, because they were stuck in this \"stage\" setup, the actors could only move side to side, never towards or away from the camera. Like in \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), the actors walk back and forth across the screen, but the camera never follows them.\n\nBecause of this stage-like setup, the shots were always long or medium shots.  No close-ups, ever! This came from the theatre and vaudeville, where the audience wanted to see the whole thing at once.  Since the actors never walked towards the camera, there was no need for close-ups.\n\nAnd get this, most of these trick films stuck to one idea per film. It meant they were really short, like just a minute or less. They couldn't tell a much of a story because they were so short. They were more like little vaudeville acts, with magic tricks, disappearing stuff, and switching things around. But here's the thing: what looked like one shot to us, might actually be several shots put together to make the magic happen, like in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895). If you look really closely, you'll see where they switched shots to make it look like her head was chopped off!",
            "Alright, so there's this dude, John Taylor, from Caroline. This guy was all about the whole \"Republican\" thing, ya know, back in the day.  He mostly did farming stuff, but even that, plus his little stint in politics, made him a real loudmouth when it came to freedom and stuff.\n\nSee, Taylor was all about farms.  He thought farming was the best job ever, and that's what made him think the way he did about the government. He wanted to keep farms strong, and that's why he got so worked up about how the government worked, like the Constitution and even the courts.\n\nThis guy thought America had a shot at making things perfect, 'cause there wasn't any old tradition messing things up. He thought we could make our own rules, ya know, do our own thing.  He believed everyone had rights, like, super important rights, and if one was messed with, they all were, see? He thought the government shouldn't mess with those rights at all. He was like, \"Man's natural state\" means the strong guys are the ones who win, but in a society, that ain't right.\"\n\nTo make this perfect society, Taylor thought the government had to be built to understand that people are good and bad at the same time. He was super strict about this idea of good and evil. He said, \"Government is run by humans, so it's gotta have both good and bad parts.\" He thought good stuff meant protecting your stuff, making farming better, and not liking capitalism too much.  He figured a good government would work fair no matter who was running it, 'cause everyone's greedy anyway.  He saw greed as normal, but bad when it meant making a bunch of groups that hurt each other.  A good government was needed to keep the bad stuff in check, but even then, had to be watched close so it didn't get worse.\n\nLike a lot of Republicans back then, Taylor thought the Constitution should be followed exactly as it was written. He wanted a government that didn't have much power, only what was in the Constitution. He knew a big government was expensive and could be a real pain. But he didn't think just reading the words was enough, you had to know what the guys who wrote it *meant.* He even thought the Declaration of Independence was more important, 'cause it said America was a bunch of states, not one big country.",
            "Alright, so check this out. We had this thing going where people logged their commutes, right? Figure 17 shows that things went *totally* downhill in month three. Kind of bummed us out, gotta be honest. We figured maybe it was the weather. Winter hit hard in New England, and who wants to bike or walk when it's freezing? Plus, December is crazy busy for everyone at college - finals, grades, the whole shebang.  Maybe the log thing just got lost in the shuffle. Then there's the holidays, with everyone gone for a month. School's back in session in January, but still, not a lot of logs. February was a mystery, though.  \n\nMaybe at first everyone was all hyped up about the project, and then things just fizzled out. To get things rolling again, we did this \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, and it actually worked! More people started logging their commutes. But the lesson was clear: keeping people engaged is tough, especially with all the breaks and stuff that happen in college.\n\nAnother big thing? People *love* their cars. It's like a national obsession. So, we had to bribe them with prizes! Gift cards to restaurants, coffee shops, even massages. We thought it was pretty sweet, but maybe we should've gone bigger - like a fancy bike, a hybrid car, even an electric one! Think that would've brought in more people.\n\nWe kept the same prizes throughout the whole project. Maybe changing things up would've helped. Imagine if we announced at the start of December that we'd give away a couple bikes, and then in January, a hybrid or electric car! I bet we'd see a ton more people logging their commutes.",
            "Alright, lemme break this down for ya.  See, these things called ETFs are like supercharged index funds. They track stuff like stocks or even whole markets, but you can buy and sell 'em just like regular stock, ya know?  It's like the best of both worlds, but lemme tell ya, there's a catch. \n\nThese ETFs, they cost less to run than those index funds, but ya gotta pay a fee every time ya buy or sell 'em. Kinda like payin' a toll road, except instead of a bridge, it's your money.  But hey, the good news is, there's a ton of different ETFs out there, so you can find one that fits your style.\n\nNow, some smart folks like to check if these ETFs really do what they say they do.  Like, let's say there's this ETF called IHF.  It's got a bunch of stocks inside, but what if those stocks ain't doin' so hot?  Could be better off just buyin' those stocks straight up, ya know? \n\nSo, what these brainiacs did was they took a look at IHF's top ten stocks, the ones that make up most of the ETF. They figured if those ten stocks are doin' well, then the whole ETF should be doin' well too.  And guess what?  They found out that just buyin' those ten stocks might actually give ya a better return, and even less risk!\n\nBut wait, there's more! They also checked if the risk level, called Beta, was the same for the ETF and the ten stocks.  Turns out, the ten stocks were a little less risky.\n\nSo, it looks like sometimes you might be better off just pickin' your own stocks instead of usin' an ETF.  But hey, that's just one story.  Gotta do your own research, ya know?",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this poem \"Dream-Land\" by Edgar Allan Poe, a real head-scratcher. Poe talks about this place called \"Thule\" twice, and it's got a whole history. Turns out, some dude named Virgil used it first, back in the day, to describe a place way up north, like the end of the world, ya know? But get this, Poe was a big fan of German authors, especially this guy Goethe. Now, Goethe had a poem called \"The King of Thulé\" about this sad king who loses his wife and goes on a downward spiral, drinking and grieving 'til he finally kicks the bucket.  Sounds kinda familiar to Poe's style, right?  It's like Poe took that whole vibe and threw it into \"Dream-Land\". Poe even uses \"Thule\" as a bookend in \"Dream-Land\", like he's putting a stamp on it. Kinda makes ya wonder if Poe was taking inspiration from Goethe, ya know?  Poe was smart, he knew his stuff, and he loved to play with ideas. Plus, Goethe was a big deal back then, everyone was talking about him, so Poe probably picked it up somehow. It's like a little secret message for all the smart folks who know their literature.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this lady, Jennifer Palmer. She took a spill in a grocery store, tripped on some spilled applesauce, and went 'boom' - busted back! Now, she's sayin' the store manager, this dude Martin, shoulda known better 'cause folks had been slipping on stuff all over the place. She's talkin' about suein' for some extra cash, not just for her busted back, but 'cause she thinks Martin was bein' a real jerk about it all.\n\nSee, Martin got told twice about the applesauce mess, but he was too busy stuffin' his face with dinner, he says. \"Nah, I ain't got time for customer complaints,\" he says. So, an hour later, Jennifer comes along, slips, and BAM! Injury city.\n\nNow, in California, ya can get extra dough if ya prove someone was bein' a real jerk, like they meant to hurt ya or were willfully ignorin' that their mess could hurt someone. Jennifer's sayin' Martin totally knew people were gettin' hurt from these spills, but he didn't care. He's basically sayin', \"Let 'em slip, I got my dinner!\"\n\nThe judge ain't gonna throw the case out just yet. Jennifer's got some points, 'specially since this ain't the first time this kinda thing happened.  But whether she can prove Martin was bein' a total jerk, that's another story.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this Islam class I took ages ago. We were all huffing and puffing about whether Islam was, ya know, a bad religion or not.  Still think it's a head-scratcher, especially after 9/11, ya know? \n\nThe news went from totally bashing Islam to, like, kissing its feet.  Can you believe it? We'd never see a dude named Barack Obama running for president back then, especially with that Muslim family history of his. \n\nThis Muhammad dude's story is kinda messed up, too. I thought he was all about force-feeding Islam down people's throats, conquering tribes and making 'em convert. But this book paints him as a, get this, martyr! Misunderstood, humble, the whole nine yards. People just flocked to him, seein' the light and all. Sounds fishy, right?\n\nAnd get this, there's some crazy similarities between Jesus and Muhammad.  Like this one time Muhammad turned mutton and milk into a whole feast for forty guys!  They're trying to make Muhammad look like a humble prophet, like he didn't need to prove anything, just living his truth and whatnot.  It's bogus, man, it totally downplays Jesus' awesomeness.\n\nThere's also all these stories about how people converted to Islam on their own, but they're all secondhand, like whispers down a hallway.  Someone told someone who told someone else.  It's not exactly solid proof, if you ask me.\n\nThe whole thing just feels like they're trying to elevate Muhammad, make him out to be some godly dude.  But history says he was more of a power-hungry dude, and it makes me wonder if Muslims today even know the real story behind his rise to the top.",
            "Hold on to your hats, folks, 'cause things are about to get wild in the world of Christianity! It's like this: Jesus dropped some serious knowledge bombs back in the day, but after he bounced, things got kinda... messy.  Think of it like a game of telephone, where the message gets twisted with every retelling.  Now, the world's getting woke and progressive faster than a cheetah on espresso.  The old-timers might grumble and cling to their dusty teachings, but they ain't gonna stop the tide.  \n\nGet this: Christians are gonna start digging deep into their history, like archaeologists unearthing a lost treasure.  They'll be like, \"Hold up a sec, what exactly did Jesus actually teach?\" and they'll peel back all those layers of extra stuff that got added over the years.  It might take a while, maybe even a few centuries, but lemme tell ya, it's gonna happen.  It's like rewinding time on a clock, going back to the good ol' days when it was all about Jesus and his message.\n\nWhen this wave hits America and Europe, churches will be packed, but with a twist.  Instead of a million different flavors of Christianity, everyone will be singing from the same hymn book.  Think of it like a big, happy family reunion where everyone's finally getting along.  History's full of these crazy reversals, like how the Romans turned from persecuting Christians to becoming Christians themselves.  And remember how America used to have slavery, but now? Well, African Americans are leading the charge!\n\nSo, get ready for a major shake-up in the Christian world.  It'll start with people realizing that Jesus' words are more like metaphors than a rulebook.  And then, boom!  Back to basics.  \n\nNow, let's rewind back to the beginning, to those early days of Judaism, the root of the whole Christian thing.  Back then, it was all about one God, divine messages, and those ancient Hebrew scriptures.  But even then, there were different groups, like the Sadducees, Pharisees, and Zealots.",
            "Man, this book, *The Jungle*, it's like lookin' at a whole city just full of jerks. You know, the kinda guys who think the world revolves around 'em. Like these factory bosses, they're all about makin' their money, makin' their factories bigger, louder, and smokier. They don't care about the workers, they don't care about the air they're pollutin', they just wanna see those profits roll in. This one part, it says the buildings are \"clear-cut and black against the sky\" and the smoke's just streamin' out forever. It's like they're tryin' to choke the whole thing, you know?\n\nAnd get this, these bosses, they don't even think twice before tossin' workers aside like yesterday's news.  They make 'em work crazy hours, then bam! Layoffs! No warning, no help, nothin'. It's like they're sayin', \"Tough luck, pal, find another gig!\" You see, back then, there weren't any rules to protect the workers.  It was a free-for-all, and these bosses, they were like wild animals.\n\nThe book even says it straight up: the workers are just slaves.  No rights, no power, just stuck in this awful system. They're treated worse than dirt, and there's no one to help 'em. Unions try to step in, but they just end up makin' things worse, takin' money from the people they're supposed to be helpin'. It's a real messed up situation.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya 'bout this author dude, F. Scott Fitzgerald. He's got this knack for makin' ya feel things, ya know? He uses all sorts of tricks to do it, some work better than others.  Take his book, *The Great Gatsby*, for example. He likes to throw together words that don't usually hang out together, like two random dudes at a party. That throws ya off, makes ya think.  He also loves to use symbols, like colors, to make ya feel somethin' special.  He's got this thing for gold, green, white and gray, and red and pink. He builds up this whole vibe around these colors, then BAM! He uses 'em to make ya remember somethin' important, somethin' that'll stick with ya.\n\nTake white and gray, for instance. He makes 'em mean somethin' special, see? White is kinda fancy, like someone rich wearin' a crisp white shirt. Gray, on the other hand, is older, faded, like somethin' that's been around the block a few times. He starts throwin' these colors around from the get-go. Daisy and Jordan are always in white, everyone's wearin' white, like it's the only color that matters. Even Nick, when he's at Gatsby's party, he's rockin' white flannels. It's like a white takeover!  \n\nThen, bam, Fitzgerald throws in some gray. He describes the names on Nick's timetable as \"gray names,\" like they're nothin' special. He says Catherine's apartment is \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" all uniform and boring.  Even the people are white or gray – Daisy and Jordan had a \"white girlhood,\" there are \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes. It's like he's sayin' that these things, these people, they're just part of the background, nothin' special.\n\nSo, what's his point? Well, he starts usin' these colors to make us feel somethin' about Daisy. After a while, he describes her in white again, like she's just another piece of the puzzle, somethin' Gatsby wants. He even says she's got a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar,\" like she's lost in the fog of it all. \n\nFitzgerald's really good at usin' colors to talk about things that are important, and he does it in a way that makes ya feel somethin' deep down.",
            "Man, San Diego is like, totally ripe for growing stuff, ya know? It's all sunny and cozy there. They grow this crazy amount of tomatoes, citrus, greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. It's crazy! And get this, there are tons of people who are all about that organic life, like, seriously, they're willing to wait forever for their veggies. They're even nuts for organic eggs and milk! \n\nA lot of these farms give tours, too, and you can even go hiking and birdwatching there. It's like, a win-win! You get to help the environment, make some cash, and teach people about farming. \n\nNow, organic farming is cool and all, but it can be tough. You gotta work way harder to keep the bugs and weeds away without those nasty chemicals. It's like, a full-time job! And sometimes, you lose more stuff than you would with regular farming. But hey, it's good for the planet, right?\n\nSpeaking of the planet, did you know there's this place near Potrero called, like, Chaparral or something? It's got all this stuff like oak trees and grasslands, and it's right next to this giant forest. They're even worried about all these endangered animals living there, like kangaroo rats and frogs and butterflies. \n\nThis land has been around forever, man. Native Americans lived there for ages, then some ranchers came along and started raising cattle. Now, this one dude wants to start an organic farm there, but he needs some help. He's gotta make money, take care of the animals, and keep the government happy. It's a lot to handle!",
            "Alright, so listen up! This whole culture thing is a big deal when you're trying to, you know, get stuff done with other peeps. See, culture ain't just one thing, it's like a whole bag of mixed nuts, ya know? You can't just say \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are chill\" 'cause that's just dumb.  Sure, there are some general ideas about different cultures, but to really get somewhere, you gotta figure out what makes that culture tick.  Like, how do they think, what's important to them, and how will that play out when you're haggling?  \n\nWhen you're meeting people from a different place, you're gonna compare 'em to your own crew, it's natural. But instead of judging 'em, just try to understand where they're coming from. You gotta play by their rules, especially if you're the one not holding all the cards.  Respect their stuff, their ways, their traditions, you know? It'll make things go smoother.\n\nAnd hey, culture ain't just about countries, it's about companies too! Some places are all about long hours and serious business, while others are more laid-back.  Look at how people dress, how they talk, who's in charge, and how they hire folks.  Even in America, places are different! It's like a whole other world sometimes.  \n\nNow, values are the real secret sauce. They're the \"why\" behind the culture. If a place values saving face, you better not go around embarrassing your boss to win a deal.  And if they're all about hard bargaining, don't expect them to back down easy.  You gotta figure this stuff out before you even show up at the table. But hey, don't forget to get to know the people you're dealing with on a personal level too.  That's how you really make a connection and get things done.",
            "So, lemme tell ya about these two dudes, Anselm and Aquinas. They both thought God was the real deal, like, totally, and they both tried to prove it. But they went about it in different ways. Anselm was all about lookin' inside yourself, sayin' that God's gotta exist 'cause ya know it in your bones, like it's just plain true. It's kinda like faith, ya know? You gotta believe it even if you can't see it. \n\nAquinas, on the other hand, was more of a \"show me the proof\" kinda guy. He said we could figure out God exists by lookin' at the world around us, like seein' how things work and how everything's connected. He had these five big ideas, kinda like puzzle pieces, that all fit together to show that God's gotta be there.\n\nNow, both of these guys made some good points, but neither of 'em really blew my mind. It's like, they both had parts of the puzzle, but they weren't quite picture-perfect. You gotta figure out the rest for yourself, ya know?",
            "Whoa, dude! So this dude, Buddha, was born like, way back in the day, like the fifth or sixth century BCE.  He was a prince, but then he ditched all that fancy stuff and went all zen, ya know? He figured out how to escape the crazy cycle of life, death, and rebirth, and his peeps started calling him Buddha, which means \"the awakened one.\" His teachings, they blew everyone's minds and became this big thing called Buddhism. There's this group, the Theravada Buddhists, they're like the OG Buddhists, and they've been around for like, 2,500 years.  \n\nBut get this, Buddhism ain't exactly the same as it was back then. Like, in Sri Lanka, these guys have this crazy water-cutting ceremony, and it's a big deal, but Buddha never mentioned anything about it!  See, over time, Buddhism has changed a lot, from little things like traditions to, like, the big ideas that make up the whole religion.\n\nThink of it like this: Buddhism is like a cool band, right? They started out with a killer sound, but over the years, they've added new instruments, changed some songs, maybe even got a new bass player. It's still the same band, but it's evolved!\n\nSo, to understand this whole thing, we gotta talk about some important words: \"internal forces\" and \"external forces.\"  Internal means stuff that comes from inside the Buddhist community, like monks and lay people. External means anything from, like, outside the church. Now, \"hostile\" forces are like, bad vibes, they try to mess up Buddhism. Benign forces, they don't really care about Buddhism, but sometimes they end up helping or hurting it accidentally.\n\nNow, let's get to the heart of Theravada Buddhism. They believe in the \"Triple Gem\": Buddha, the teachings (the Dhamma), and the community (the Sangha). The Dhamma is like the Buddhist rulebook, it's got all these scriptures called the Tripitaka. It's got stories, rules, and deep philosophical stuff. They talk about Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (life is suffering), and Anicca (everything changes).  \n\nThe whole idea is, if you understand these things, you can escape the cycle of death and rebirth (Sansara) and get rid of desire, hatred, and delusion.  Then, bam! You're enlightened!",
            "'So, you know how Mack keeps sending these crazy robot things after us?' I said, 'Well, lemme tell ya, the US and Mexico kinda did that thing, but with, like, war and stuff. Back in the day, like 1836 to 1893, they were at each other's throats for a solid 57 years! It was intense, man. Like, they fought a whole war, the Mexican-American War, and the US basically took over Texas and the Southwest. Talk about a bad breakup! \n\nSee, they were clashing over all sorts of stuff - religion, culture, you name it. Plus, they both wanted the same land. Kinda like how we're always arguing over who gets the last slice of pizza, but, y'know, on a national level.\n\nIt's not just the US and Mexico, though. Lots of countries that are neighbors have this \"we're better than you\" thing going on. Makes ya wonder, right? \n\nAnyway, the US and Mexico, they were like the ultimate frenemies.  This guy, David Pletcher, said that the US had major problems with Mexico and Cuba, and they were the only ones who really messed with America.  \n\nReligion was a big deal, too. Like, the US was all about \"we do things our way,\" and Mexico was like, \"nah, we got our own thing going on.\" It's kinda like how Cybe and B.B. always argue about video games.\n\nThe whole thing started way back when, with the English and Spanish getting into it.  That kinda messed things up for the US and Mexico from the start.\n\nThey had tons of fights over land and stuff.  It was like a never-ending game of tag, but with guns.  Finally, though, things started to cool down. Mexico needed the US for stuff, and the US realized that taking over more land wasn't the best idea.",

Nothing's certain anymore, except this: I wouldn't have made it through all this without my family and a few good friends, even though sometimes I feel like a total weakling. 'Cause when disaster strikes, you realize just how weak you really are. \n\nLife throws curveballs, big and small. No matter how much you plan, some stuff just knocks you down.  We gotta stop putting all our faith in the big government, 'cause that ship's sunk, let's be real. \n\nInstead, we gotta learn to trust each other again.  Help each other out, get comfortable asking for help.  We're better off as a pack, not a bunch of loners building their own little fallout shelters. \n\nThose conservatives talk about \"rugged individualism,\" but back in the day, the pioneers didn't make it across the country alone.

            "Alright, lemme tell ya about this crazy thing called evolution! \n\nSo, scientists have been trying to figure out how critters change over time, like how a plain ol' snail shell turns into a crazy spiral. Back in the day, some dude named D'Arcy Thompson said it was like trying to describe a snowflake with math - tough, right?  Well, nowadays, they're using math to try and figure out how shells grow and change. Think of it like building a shell with math equations!\n\nThese guys took pictures of snail shells and used fancy computer programs to see how different shapes could grow. They're even doing experiments to see how these shapes actually happen. It's like a detective story, trying to figure out the secrets of shell evolution!\n\nSo, imagine a snail's shell like a long, twisty tube. Each twist is called a whorl, and they all spiral around a line called the columella. The shell grows bigger as it goes, and you can see the lines between each whorl called sutures. \n\nNow, there are all sorts of ways to look at a shell - from the top (apical view), the bottom (basal view), the opening (apertural view), and the opposite of that (abapertural view). \n\nThey even have a trick for counting how many whorls there are. You gotta look at the shell from the top and find the first suture. Draw a line down the middle and count the whorls on each side.\n\nThink of it like the snail building its shell one tiny piece at a time. Each piece is like a little door (aperture), and they all stack up in a special way.  They can even use math to see how these doors move and change shape over time. It's wild, right?",

We talkin' serious short comin's here!\n\nThey're tryin' to get more folks with fancy medical degrees at birth, which is cool, but some of these 'skilled workers' are just midwives, and when things get hairy, they ain't exactly equipped to handle it. So yeah, that fancy number might look good, but it ain't tellin' the whole story. And guess what? Less kids with tummy aches are seein' a doctor now, which ain't exactly a great sign. \n\nEven gettin' help after the baby's born is a mess. They ain't got enough doctors for that, either. And get this - they ain't doin' enough c-sections, especially out in the sticks. It's like the city folks get all the good stuff, while the poor folks are stuck with nothin'. That ain't right, man! \n\nSo, what's the answer? Should they just focus on one little problem at a time, or should they beef up the whole healthcare system? That's a tough one. \n\nSee, focusin' on one problem is like throwin' a bandaid on a gash. It might stop the bleedin' for a bit, but it ain't gonna fix the whole thing. And if you keep throwin' bandaids on every little thing, you're gonna end up with a whole lotta bandaids and a whole lotta problems.",
            "Alright, so get this: Victorian books are all about being super detailed and talking about fancy folks. But then there's these two books, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" that are like, \"Nah, we're gonna do things differently.\" \n\nThese books are all about mystery and weird stuff, which wasn't really a thing in most Victorian books. And that makes the characters way more interesting! It gives you a peek into their heads and why they do the stuff they do.\n\nLike, take this part from \"Oliver Twist\":\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n\nSee, Oliver's having these crazy visions, like dreams or something. He's confused and scared, and it shows us how messed up he feels inside.\n\nBoth \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" use these dream-like scenes to show us what's going on in the characters' minds. In \"Oliver Twist,\" they show us Oliver's pain and how he's starting to understand the world around him. When he gets shot, he relives it over and over in his head, like a bad dream. It shows us how much pain he's in and how helpless he feels.\n\nThe shooting makes you wonder who's really in control, because it's definitely not Oliver.  He's like a puppet, just going along for the ride.  It's like Fagin is breaking him down, making him give up and accept his fate.\n\n\nAnd here's another example from \"Wuthering Heights\"...\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.\"",
            "Couple years back, I was helping out at this after-school program, you know, tutoring those little elementary kids. I was pretty good at English and reading, so that's what I mostly did.  But then this little dude, Adrian, probably in third or fourth grade, came along. He was struggling to read, real bad.  It was weird, though. He'd nail some letters perfectly, then totally botch others.  Made no sense! He spoke perfect English, but something was off.  We were stuck in a rut until one day Adrian's mom came to pick him up.  I'm talking full-on Spanish speaker, zero English.  We managed to make sense of things with my rusty Spanish skills (I was just starting to learn, you know).  And then it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read, just not the English alphabet real well.  I don't know if it helped in the long run, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nSee, that story is all about the language barrier in schools, especially here in California.  It shows you that things aren't always as obvious as they seem.  Even if a kid speaks English perfectly, reading it can still be a real pain.  Everyone knows this is a problem, right? So what do we do about it? \n\nFor Adrian, it was simple:  tutoring him in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for kids who barely speak English, it's way more complicated.  There's no one magic bullet.  Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes – none of them are the answer on their own.  We gotta combine them all!\n\nDual language programs are a great idea, not just for Spanish speakers, but for everyone!  \"Kids in these programs actually do better in school,\" you know?  There's a lot of fear about them, like they waste resources and don't benefit most kids.  But that's just wrong. If we made them the norm instead of the exception, everyone would win. \n\nHow do we do that? Do we make all teachers bilingual? Nah, that's crazy talk. But we can totally have bilingual helpers, tutors, whatever you want to call them.",
            "Okay, so like, everyone's always talkin' about some big somethin' out there, right?  Some kinda super-duper somethin' bigger than us, bigger than our whole heads can even wrap around.

We change our minds and find somethin' else.  It's all about findin' our own way, you know?  Like, we're all searchin' for a freakin' light in the dark, somethin' to guide us outta the shadows and into the sunshine.\n\nMy dad, he was a smoker. We'd sit on the porch, rain poundin' on the roof like a drum solo, and just puff away.  He was lookin' kinda thin, clothes saggin' on him, hair like a bad wig.  He'd stare out at the rain, kinda lost in thought.  I wanted to talk to him, but I was scared.  Scared to say what I was thinkin', scared of makin' it all real.  So I just hugged him, sat closer, and stared at the rain with him.\n\nMy dad, he kicked the bucket in December, a few days after my 22nd birthday.  The chemo and all that stuff didn't really help, just kept him around longer than the doctors thought.  I dunno, what was the point of that?  What kinda jerk God would do that?  Honestly, I didn't pray.  If there was a God out there, He'd stopped listenin' to me a long time ago.\n\nI didn't wanna watch him die.  Couldn't watch the guy who made me disappear.  I wanted to remember him for how he lived, not how he died.  I knew him better than anyone, better than even his family.  I knew he wouldn't want me sittin' there like a creep, watchin' him die.  So I just curled up in bed for three days, waitin' for the news.\n\nNo one even had the decency to call.",
            "Alright, listen up! The whole \"Gothic Novel\" thing is kinda whack, ya know? Like, it's called \"Gothic\" but it's all about this old-timey stuff mixed with somethin' new. This dude, Ian Watt,  said it best: a real oxymoron, like \"jumbo shrimp\"! Some folks think it's garbage, others think it's deep as the ocean. They've called it everything from boring to totally awesome for how creepy it gets.  \n\nSo, this first \"Gothic Novel,\"  *The Castle of Otranto* by Horace Walpole,  it's like the OG of the whole shebang. It takes those old-school stories, like the ones from ancient times, and mixes 'em with the newfangled way of writing novels, ya dig?  Walpole throws in some stage stuff and tries to make it all sound real life-like. He calls it a \"Gothic Story,\" and it's all about castles and spooky stuff. \n\nBack then,  \"Gothic\" meant all sorts of things -  like,  people, styles, even time periods. It was kinda like saying \"old-fashioned\" or \"not cool\" compared to the new, modern stuff. But here's the kicker: combining that \"Gothic\" vibe with the new way of writing novels, where you get inside the characters' heads,  that's what keeps it going for so long. It's like, both old and new at the same time!\n\nOne big thing in Gothic stories is **Chivalry**.  Remember those knights in shining armor?  Well, Gothic writers loved that idea. It was all about being brave, honorable, and a total badass.  But they also thought that real life wasn't like that anymore.  So they used chivalric stuff, like knights and castles, to make the past seem better than the present. \n\nWalpole wrote *The Castle of Otranto* during a time when things were kinda messed up politically. He was worried about the future and thought maybe people weren't as good as they used to be. In his story, you see this idea with a character named Frederic.  He's described as a prince who's been through some tough stuff and is supposed to be dead.  He's basically the perfect knight, but he's also a bit over-the-top, which is kinda hilarious.  It's like, he's the ideal knight, but taken to the extreme.",
            "Alright, check it out, cuz this is how the whole supply chain thing works! It's like a crazy rollercoaster ride for stuff, from the moment someone wants somethin' to when it finally lands in their hands. Back in '82, this dude named Keith Oliver came up with the fancy name \"supply chain management.\" He was basically sayin', \"Yo, we gotta plan this whole shebang - makin' the stuff, gettin' the stuff, movin' the stuff - to make sure everyone's happy and gettin' what they need, like, yesterday!\" \n\nSo, there are these six key players in this whole supply chain game: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and info.  Think of 'em like the members of a super-cool band. Each one has a role to play, and if one's off beat, the whole thing falls apart.\n\nFirst up, we got production - that's where the magic happens! Figuring out what to make, how much, and where, that's the boss move.  Managers gotta be like detectives, sniffin' out what people want. They gotta watch the market, see what's hot, what's not, and make sure they're makin' somethin' everyone's gonna go bananas for.\n\nThen there's supply, which is like the muscle of the operation. Managers gotta figure out where to get all the stuff they need to build their products. They might have different factories for different parts, or they might outsource some stuff to other companies.  It's all about makin' things move fast and smooth, while keepin' the prices low. \n\nThe rest of the players, inventory (keepin' track of all that stuff), location (findin' the best place to make and ship things), transportation (gettin' it all where it needs to go), and info (keepin' everyone in the loop), they all work together to make sure the whole thing runs like a well-oiled machine.\n\nMake sense? Pretty cool, huh?",
            "Hold on, lemme tell ya somethin'. So there's this chick, Ellen Page, ya know, the one from Juno? She's standin' on a corner, holdin' up this cardboard sign. It's got a crazy message scribbled on it with a Sharpie, somethin' about Hitler bein' alive in Burma. Burma, it's also called Myanmar, and it's ruled by these super mean guys, a junta, who took over back in '62.  \n\nSo, back in '07, people in Burma started protestin', like, for real. It was the first time in ages they'd done somethin' like that. Monks, wearin' their saffron robes, led the way, and that's how it got called the \"Saffron Revolution.\" At first, the government was like, \"Whatever,\" let the monks hang out, but then things got outta hand. It turned into a full-blown fight between the monks and the junta, with the army bustin' into monasteries and stuff.  They even threw journalists in jail, and one guy, a Japanese photographer named Kenji, got killed just for bein' there. They say 13 people died, but some guy who ditched the army said it was way more, like, thousands.\n\nThis ain't nothin' new, though. Governments tryin' to shut down anyone who disagrees with 'em has always been a thing.  Remember those Roman emperors? They acted like they were chosen by the gods to rule everything.  And don't even get me started on the Japanese emperors, they think they're gods themselves! And here we have our own president, Bush, chattin' it up with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, which is like, part of the Republican Party. \n\nThere are all these other times this stuff has happened, like that Tiananmen Square protest in 1989, where students and activists got together to say \"no more\" to the government. The Chinese government said 200-300 died, but others say it was like 2,000-3,000. And then there's the Rwandan genocide, where Hutu guys killed all the Tutsis and anyone who wasn't with them.  And let's not forget Hitler and the Holocaust, where they rounded up all the Jews and, well, you know...",
            "Duke Ellington was a big cheese in the jazz world 'cause he stuck around forever and kept making awesome music with his band. Now, you might not hear him wailin' on the piano a whole lot in some of his tunes, but man, this dude was a genius at writing songs that showed off everyone's talent. He'd set the stage for soloists to go wild, AND he'd write super tight arrangements with parts just made for each guy in the band. That's how he made his sound so unique - he knew how to blend all those different flavors into somethin' fresh and exciting. \n\nThe folks over at Grove Music, they say Ellington was like a wizard with voices. Take his song \"Creole Love Call\" - he used voices like instruments, all smooth and jazzy, even without singin' words. He was always findin' ways to make his soloists shine, and \"Creole Love Call\" is a perfect example. It's a slow bluesy tune with six different parts, each one buildin' on the last:\n\n* **Part 1:**  A back-and-forth between a voice and the woodwinds, startin' sweet and mellow, then gettin' rougher towards the end.\n\n* **Part 2:**  A trumpet solo with a muted sound, makin' the melody stretch out and adding some bluesy bends.\n\n* **Part 3:**  A clarinet takes center stage, soaring high up with a piano riff underneath, all snappy and syncopated.\n\n* **Part 4:** The whole band jumps in, echoin' the first part with brass and reeds takin' turns.\n\n* **Part 5:**  This one's the climax! The woodwinds start the call-and-response high up, while the brass and rhythm section playin' a stoppin' and startin' groove.\n\n* **Part 6:**  Back to the first part, but this time the voice gets all growly and soulful, soloin' like an instrument.\n\n* **Ending:** A quick tag with some fancy vocal runs and a trombone doin' somethin' unexpected and cool.\n\nEllington loved usin' voices to add that extra somethin' special to his music, and he did it all over the place. \n\nIn another song called \"Hot and Bothered,\" he gets all fancy with his arrangements, and uses a call-and-response between a muted trumpet player and a scat singer. They're blendin' their sounds so well, the trumpet sounds like a voice and the voice sounds like an instrument - pure magic! And in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" he features a guy named Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, playin' a muted trombone that just grabs you with the melody.",
            "She was always lookin' for somethin', this big hole inside her that nothin' seemed to fill. It started way back when she was 14, just hittin' that teenage groove, and it was still there three years later, at 17. Now, she figured it wasn't a thing she needed, but someone.  But dude, no boys had ever grabbed her attention. Some tried, you know, the whole clumsy wooin' thing, but nothin'. She'd wrack her brain tryin' to figure it out, what kinda messed up mojo made a girl like that, but nothin' clicked. So she just kept rollin' with it, always wonderin'.\n\nHer life at home was usually pretty chill. Her folks were cool cats, never fightin' and rarely yellin', even at her. They only ever butted heads when she was tryin' to spread her wings and do her own thing. She was their kid, yeah, but totally opposite vibes. They were mellow, she was a freakin' firework. Still, everyone loved her.\n\nBut this day was anything but chill. She was wanderin' around, tryin' to spark some inspiration for somethin', when BAM! She heard her mom scream from the kitchen. Heart poundin', she raced in, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mom was sprawled on the floor, makin' little \"ow\" sounds. This chick was in trouble.  She rushed to her side, \"Mom, tell me where to take ya.\"  \"Ow... sweetie...  hospital...\"  Her voice was all crackly. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to meet you.\"  Her mom pointed, and she was thankful she'd taken those self-defense classes. She hefted her mom, tossed her in the back seat, and hit the gas.\n\nThe hospital smelled like bleach and sickness, but she couldn't even notice, too busy focusin' on her mom. She practically dragged her inside, yellin' for help. A bunch of worried faces swarmed, and someone whipped up a gurney, strapped her mom down, and whisked her away. Now she was stuck waitin', anxiety gnawin' at her.\n\nTurns out, her mom had fallen off a step stool reachin' for a fancy vase.",
            "So, gather 'round, folks, and lemme tell ya about this study they did. See, they wanted to know if this fancy \"Mediterranean Diet\" (they call it Med diet for short) could help keep your ticker in tip-top shape. Turns out, this Med diet is all about munchin' on good stuff like fruits, veggies, nuts, and fish, while keepin' the red meat and greasy stuff to a minimum. A little vino is okay too, but don't go overboard! \n\nNow, they already knew this Med diet was good for ya, but nobody had really looked at how it helped with heart attacks or strokes. So, they got this big group of nurses, over 70,000 of 'em, and asked 'em about what they ate every year for 20 years. They made sure to track all the juicy details, like exercise, smokin', and even if they took vitamins.\n\nAfter all that time, they found out that the nurses who ate the most Med-style were way less likely to have a heart attack or a stroke. It's like, the more they chowed down on that healthy stuff, the less likely they were to end up in the hospital. Pretty cool, huh?",
            "Okay, so back in 2007,  America totally crashed harder than Mack's last robot creation.  You know, the one with the disco ball and the flamethrower?  Yeah, this was a whole other level of messed up.  Jobs disappeared faster than Foxy after a free pizza buffet, and houses were worth less than a chewed-up sock.  Even the big, fancy companies were going, \"Uh oh, we're outta here!\" It's still kinda a mess, so let me tell ya, something went wrong.  Big time.  \n\nTurns out, those fancy pants politicians made some really dumb decisions. They pushed banks to give out loans to anyone, even if they couldn't afford 'em.  It was like giving B.B. a credit card and telling him to buy candy.  Disaster waiting to happen!  And these places called Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they were like, \"Let's take these risky loans and make 'em into something shiny and new!\"  They called it a \"mortgage-backed security\" or something.  Sounds fancy, right?  Turns out, it was just a fancy way of saying, \"We're gonna gamble with your money!\"\n\nNow, this whole mess started back in the Clinton days.  Remember when he was president?  He wanted to look good, so he made it easier to get loans.  Seemed like a good idea at the time, but it was like setting a box of dynamite on the couch.  One spark and boom!  \n\nThen they started making these mortgages that changed interest rates like a chameleon changes colors.  And they bundled them all up into these big, complicated things called CDOs.  It was like a house of cards, except made of debt.  And guess what?  The cards fell.  People couldn't pay their loans, the banks were broke, and the whole economy went kablooey!   The big banks?  They lost tons of money.  Even the government had to step in and save the day, but it cost a whole lot of dough.  So yeah, that's the story of the financial crisis.  A bunch of bad decisions, some fancy-sounding words, and a whole lotta chaos.",
            "Okay, so, exposition. That part in your story where you're supposed to dazzle everyone with your writing, right?  The part where readers either get hooked or click away faster than you can say \"character development.\"  Even Dr. Merlin, the awesome writer, has been known to yell at her computer screen when she gets stuck in a boring, info-dumping mess.\n\nBelieve me, exposition is not your friend.\n\nWe all know \"Show, don't tell,\" but sometimes Dr. Merlin (and maybe even you!) gets carried away with too much telling.  It's like that little voice in your head whispering, \"Get all the backstory out of the way so we can get to the good stuff!\"  But that voice can be a real pain. \n\nThink of exposition like the character who tells everyone everything at once, like a walking encyclopedia.  It's the equivalent of someone saying, \"Oh, by the way, this princess was raised in a tower, she has a talking animal sidekick, and her evil stepmother tried to kill her – but let's get to the exciting part!\"\n\nHere's a classic example: You're reading a story and you're told the heroine met her soulmate, got married in a fancy ceremony, and then her husband was murdered right in front of her.  You wouldn't want the whole story of their love to take up two pages of dialogue-less descriptions.  You want to see their love, feel it, understand it! Show us how much he loved her through his actions and words.  Show us how her life changed for the better because of him.  Give us a reason to actually care about him and her! \n\nBasically, you want more than just the bare bones. You want the juicy details, the emotions, the connections!",
            "Alright, so I watched a couple newscasts from Columbus, Ohio. One was NBC 4, live this mornin', August 13, 2011.  First up, this dude Shad Hostettler, stabbed his wife, Ashley, Ohio, messed up real bad. They showed his mug shot – looked like a total jerk. They only gave it about two minutes, though. Said he stabbed her a bunch of times. They caught the creep, so that's good. \n \nNext up, young Travis Buyers, 18, shot down in Sharon Woods. Real bad shape, no arrests yet, SWAT team on the case. Seemed kinda rushed, like they didn't wanna talk about it too much. Kinda makes you wonder if it's 'cause he was black, ya know? 'Cause when it's a white kid, the whole town freaks out. But when it's a minority, it's like, whatever.  \n \nThen they had a story about a bullet hole in a Med-Flight helicopter.  .22 caliber, rifle shot. They were lookin' for the shooter, Crime-Stoppers offerin' five grand for tips. \n \nRain and heat comin' Saturday, they said. Short story, just a tease to keep ya watchin'.  \n \nThen a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road. They described the robber as a tall, skinny, dark-skinned black dude in a hoodie. Seemed like they were really playin' up his race, which is kinda weird. \n \nLast one was about Rene Rodriguez, this Texas drug kingpin.  They called him a \"Hispanic man\" which, come on, really? Anyway, he got 300 months in prison, which is 25 years, but they said it like that to make it sound scarier, I guess.",
            "Yo, lemme tell ya about brothers, man. It's like, there's this crazy connection, ya know? It's like a messed up rollercoaster of emotions, all tangled up together.  There's love, sure, but also pride, jealousy, and even straight-up meanness. Brothers get each other like nobody else, man. It's like lookin' in a mirror, seein' yourself, but messed up and twisted. \n\nWhen things get rough, that's when the real deal comes out. It's either gonna be good or bad, no in-between.  And let me tell ya, all this brotherly stuff, it comes with a price. It ain't all sunshine and roses.\n\nThis whole brother thing, man, it's about seein' your reflection in another person, not just how people see you, but the real you, the good and the bad. \n\nThis story, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" it's all about this, ya know? These two brothers, they're messin' around in this crazy, beautiful place, but it's all going south fast. Pride and disappointment, it's like a bomb ready to go off.  In the end, only one brother makes it out alive.  \n\nIt's all about how the main guy feels, and how he sees himself and his brother. You can see it in his actions, in the things he does and the stuff that happens because of it. That's what makes him who he is.",
            "Yo, check it! The brain, it's like, super complex, ya know? It's all about taking in info and making stuff up like a mad scientist. Back in the day, people thought it was like a wax tablet, then papyrus, then a book, and now they're sayin' it's like a computer. But hold up, those are just comparisons, see? They don't tell the whole story, so don't go gettin' all hung up on 'em.\n\nSo, your senses, they're like the input, right? They grab stuff from the world - touch, sound, light, heat - and turn it into signals the brain can understand. Then, the brain, it's like a crazy party, with all these signals gettin' passed around and changed up. Like, when you see a box on a white background, your brain starts piecing together the colors, shapes, edges, all that jazz. That's bottom-up processing, man.  But then, your brain also uses what it already knows - like \"boxes are usually solid\" - to figure out what it's lookin' at faster. That's top-down processing, like a shortcut.\n\nNow, the brain's got this thing called attention, think of it like a bouncer at a club. It decides what's important and lets some signals in while shooing others away. You see a million blades of grass, but you don't notice each one individually, right? That's attention filterin' out the noise. But your name? BAM! That gets through the bouncer like you're on the guest list.\n\nBut hold up, before we can do anything with info, we gotta store it. There's short-term memory, kinda like a notepad, and long-term memory, the big ol' filing cabinet.  Short-term memory holds stuff for a few seconds, and they think it's like electrical signals buzzin' around in your brain. Long-term memory, well, that's a mystery, but they think it's stored in the way proteins are built.\n\nThere are tons of theories about how our brain organizes all this knowledge, like maps and networks. One idea is that concepts are like nodes, connected by how related they are. So \"chair\" is linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "Sa2b here. So, check it out. This dude Huxley wrote this story, \"Brave New World,\" and it's totally messed up, man. He's like, \"Whoa, technology and all this money stuff is gonna be our downfall!\"  \n\nSee, in this story, everyone's all happy-happy, but they're like robots, man. They're told to be happy all the time and just go with the flow. No thinking, no real feelings, just instant gratification. It's like they're hypnotized by this guy in charge, the World Controller, who's basically the big cheese.\n\nHuxley was onto something, though. Remember how Marx talked about how everyone gets tricked into thinking they're doing good when they're just working for the man?  That's totally what's happening here. The people are so obsessed with stuff and being happy that they don't even realize they're being manipulated. It's like they're in a trance.\n\nHe's using this thing called \"false consciousness,\"  where people are basically too busy trying to get the next shiny thing to see what's really going on. They're like, \"Gimme, gimme!\" and the World Controller is like, \"Sure, here you go, but don't ask questions!\"\n\nAnd get this - the rich guys know what's up, but they just let it happen. They're like, \"Yeah, we're in charge, and they're fine with it.\"  It's messed up, man.\n\nHuxley also shows how people just don't connect with each other anymore. They're so focused on themselves and their stuff that they don't even have real relationships. It's all superficial, like a bunch of robots going through the motions.\n\nHe's basically saying that technology and capitalism are killing our humanity.  It's a wake-up call, man.",
            "Alright, lemme tell ya, this whole campus thing is a real trip. Been here for two and a half years, four and a half semesters, and let me tell ya, getting around this place can be a real pain in the tail feathers. Freshman year, I got stuck in East Halls, which is like, a million miles from everywhere else.  I mean, to get to Willard building, which is practically in the middle of campus, it could take me 25 minutes just walkin', and that’s if the weather's decent.  State College weather, man, it's like a roller coaster itself!  \n\nTalked to an old grad, not too much older than me, and he said things used to be even worse. Back in the day, East Halls was like its own little island, surrounded by nothin' but empty fields. Now, they've built all these new sports fields, fancy buildings like the Creamery and that new health center, and apartments everywhere. It's like they just keep buildin' and buildin', but nobody thinks about how to get around.\n\nSo, what's the answer to this campus traffic jam? Bikes, baby! But it's not just about havin' the bike, you gotta have a campus that works for cyclists.\n\nMy buddy, he got back into ridin' after a few years off, and he was like, \"Man, I can't believe I ever stopped. Bikes are the only way to go!\"  They're good for ya, too, healthy and all that jazz. Plus, you can go far on a tank of oatmeal and a little leg power. \n\nI live off-campus now, 'bout as far from the center as some dorms, but I bought a bike this year and it was the best decision ever. My classes are in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk, but on my bike, it's like, 5 minutes if I crank it up.  \n\nOf course, Pollock Road, the closest route, can be a real hazard, but hey, what can ya do? Sometimes you gotta ride through the madness.  Walkin' ain't bad, but I'm always on the go.  Without my bike, I'd be walkin' to class, appointments, everywhere, and that's just too much time lost. That's like, two and a half hours a week, man!"
