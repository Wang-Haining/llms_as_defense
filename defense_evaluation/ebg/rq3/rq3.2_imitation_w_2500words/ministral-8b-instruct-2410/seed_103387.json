            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "So, I'm all set to dive into an education in social work. My dream is to work with the Division of Family and Children Services, helping kids who have been abused or neglected, and providing support for troubled families. I've got some core values that I think I can bring to the social work field: service, respect, ethical nature, and a commitment to improving relationships between people, as well as my own professional growth. These values aren't just for the job; they're deeply personal to me too.\n\nI've always had a heart for helping others, but I wasn't sure what career path to take. Throughout high school and college, I saw many people shying away from their problems and using coping mechanisms that weren't ideal. These experiences led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break from my studies. One summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy nervously sitting on her couch. Turns out, he was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parents’ house. I offered to help, driving over to the house to talk to the police. They asked me to talk to the parents, as there was nothing they could do legally for the teenager. The parents seemed nervous and blamed their son for involving outsiders to resolve simple disputes. After this, I started seriously considering a career in social work to help kids with family conflicts.\n\nAnother key value in social work is social justice. Our society claims to value the individual, but often we follow archaic traditions rather than truly embracing uniqueness. If we mourn lost individuals, why strive to be like everyone else? I am an individual and I don't want to limit myself based on what others are doing. Throughout my years in high school and college, I stood up against social injustice in many ways: unnatural hair colors, unique clothing choices, ear piercings, involvement with GSBA, fighting against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will continue to protest injustices I see.",
            "So here's a quick rundown of what the paper's all about. It's a deep dive into Biological and Sociocultural models and their take on insomnia. The Biological model zeros in on the genetic and health aspects, like how genes and medical conditions can mess with sleep. Meanwhile, the Sociocultural model looks at environmental factors, including race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review takes a closer look at insomnia through these lenses, breaking down each piece of research to explain how it relates to these models. It also critiques the strengths and weaknesses of these studies.\n\nSleep disorders come in all shapes and sizes. You've got primary sleep disorders like dyssomnias or parasomnias, which are standalone issues. Sleep disorders tied to another mental disorder usually fall under Axis I or Axis II disorders, which cover things like clinical and personality disorders. There's also sleep disorders linked to medical complications or substance intake. Let's break down the dyssomnias a bit: Primary Insomnia is when you can't get enough sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is when you can't stay awake. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are behavioral and physical issues that happen during sleep, like Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The review focuses on insomnia, and it dabbles a bit in primary sleep disorders in general.\n\nNow, the Biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, inherited traits, and physiological factors. Neurons in the hypothalamus, which produce orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that GABAB receptors on these neurons control sleep-wake states. When these receptors are activated, they promote sleep, and if they're not firing correctly, it can cause reduced anxiety and sleep disturbances. A GABAB agonist, baclofen, extended sleep time in the study (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests that what's happening in mice can be similar in humans, showing a genetic and environmental basis for sleep disorders. If there's a problem with these receptors, it could impact sleep without medication, affecting life aspects like school, career, and routine tasks.",
            "This paper delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD): a brief definition, diagnosis, and strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to assist students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) is essentially a breakdown in the brain's ability to process sounds we hear. In other words, people with CAPD can hear normally, but their brain struggles to translate and understand sounds, particularly in noisy environments or when distinguishing between words. This disorder is often referred to as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) and was first identified in the mid-1950s, when researchers termed it \"auditory imperception.\" The journey to understanding CAPD includes pivotal contributions from researchers like Kimura and a national conference in 1977.\n\nSymptoms of CAPD vary but can include difficulty hearing sounds in space, distinguishing between sounds, recognizing sound patterns, and detecting changes in speech. People with CAPD might also struggle with sound synthesis, where they can't interpret sounds meaningfully, and may have trouble determining the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosis involves thorough screening by professionals like audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. Tests range from simple questionnaires to advanced acoustic signal recordings. It's important to note that there's no single, foolproof test or known cause for CAPD.\n\nTo support a student with CAPD in a mainstream classroom, teachers can adopt various strategies. These might include reducing background noise, clearly enunciating instructions, and providing visual aids. Encouraging the student to face the teacher or use assistive listening devices can also help. The key is to create an environment that minimizes auditory distractions and maximizes understanding.",
            "So what do you think about Shakespeare's Twelfth Night and the whole business of disguise? Well, it seems that while dressing up as someone else might be useful for pulling off a long con, in the end, you've got to shed that disguise or risk losing yourself. But watch out, 'cause when you finally come clean, you might find yourself all alone, cut off from the people you care about. After all, some folks might just take it in stride, but others, well, they might not be too happy about being fooled. And let's talk about gender swap deception, 'cause that's got its own set of issues. So why do people feel the need to hide behind a disguise? Take Viola for example. She's new in town, so she decides to masquerade as a man to keep herself safe. Her plan works, but it also makes her feel alienated from other women, and to top it all off, Olivia ends up falling in love with her. And don't even get me started on the whole Viola-Cesario-Orsino thing. It's like Viola is trapped in this love triangle, and she's the only one who doesn't know what's going on. You'd think that Shakespeare was trying to show us how deception can help release hidden emotions, but when you dig deeper, it's like Olivia is just judging people based on what they look like. I mean, she goes from being smitten with Cesario to acting like Viola is her sister. It's like she can't make up her mind. So yeah, deception can have some weird effects on people, but at the end of the day, it's all about choices. Do you risk losing yourself, or do you risk losing the people you care about?",
            "German colonial rule has been widely noted for its harshness, particularly the genocide committed against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, it's crucial to remember that nothing as vast as a colonial empire can be explained through a single description. The German colonial empire was as diverse in its policies and ruling styles as it was in its geography. Educational provision across the colonies varied greatly. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a significant population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also commended by contemporary authors. The situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike in East Africa, where the government played a major role in educating the locals, in South West Africa, native education was largely left to missionary societies that received minimal government support. The government did, however, invest heavily in educating Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and providing significant support to missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies boasted substantial numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper seeks to delve deeper into these factors and focus on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. There is a substantial body of literature on education within the German colonial empire, with many of these sources written in German and dating from the early 20th century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. Early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems in these colonies, while later works expanded this discourse through comparative studies and more detailed analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant differences across the colonies' educational systems. Cohen’s study on education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly notable. Cohen compared the educational systems of both colonies and discussed the factors contributing to the differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounted for many of the colony’s educational system's distinctive features. Compared to other German colonial possessions, South West Africa had a climate that was generally more temperate, with large portions covered by arid desert. This moderated climate attracted a relatively substantial European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population, had only 5,336 whites.",
            "So, over the past 100 years, the classification of pop music has expanded to include countless genres, making it a challenge to list them all. To make matters more complex, most, if not all genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres. Within this vast landscape, the sub-genre of heavy metal rock has proven to be one of the most diverse and expressive, with a history of innovation dating back 40 years.\n\nToday, heavy metal has evolved into a genre with countless niches, making it difficult to define what it truly is. It has absorbed themes and influences from numerous other genres, but it all started somewhere. To comprehend the heavy metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp the essence of the metal movement and why it is more than just a genre.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is defined by its darkness. It's often dubbed a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. It's less primitive and more skilled, with metal bands often showcasing exceptional instrumental prowess. Additionally, metal is heavily associated with drug use. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s led to the creation of some of the genre's most iconic, otherworldly records. This drug influence has also been a significant factor in the movement's dark, visceral qualities, which were somewhat novel in the context of popular music at the time. Furthermore, later generations have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements of the Romantic Era, as seen in lyrics like these from Helter Skelter by The Beatles:\n\nThese lyrics demonstrate the darker side of The Beatles, exhibiting an up-and-down rhythm that some attribute to drug use. This song is often considered one of the first heavy metal tracks, serving as a response to a heavier, darker Rolling Stones song. The Beatles aimed to prove they could be as heavy as the Stones, resulting in this iconic track on The White Album.",
            "Once upon a time, long before the Surrealist artists painted their dreamlike masterpieces, there was Henri Rousseau, an artist who literally and figuratively crafted his own dreams. The Dream, a 1910 piece by the Post-Impressionist artist, isn't just about a woman in awe of her dreamt land; it's a reflection of Rousseau's personal dreams and aspirations as a painter. He dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but faced a tough internal struggle: should he conform to or mimic certain painting styles to gain acceptance, or forge his own unique path?\n\nBefore diving into The Dream, let's explore Rousseau's life story. Born in Laval, northwest France, on May 21, 1844, he was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer. He grew up without formal art training and worked as a gabelou (municipal toll employee) until he was 40. After his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their infant children passed away, Rousseau was left with his daughter Julia and immense grief. Painting became his escape and fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries who idealized peasants in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter, dreaming of the average class's hopes and dreams.\n\nRousseau's desire for art world acceptance is understandable in context. Uneducated in art, he started painting late and worked alongside other accomplished artists. Recognition came to him when Matisse was gaining traction. According to Jan Gordon in Modern French Painters, both artists were different: Matisse feared painting tritely, while Rousseau dreamed of a conventional picture that would gain him entry into the Artiste Français.",
            "Many a great thinker has suggested a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe this is because, at the core of it, there is a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats puts it in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMore to the point, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. For instance, a conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa may discuss foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not explain why it is good art. Typically, when asked about a favorite work of art or literature, we often hear, “There's just something about it” before a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals cannot be fully reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O’Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how well we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is always something intangible that is left unsaid. I believe the same is true for ethics. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\nI believe morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenal level, using a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, such as music, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Germany, as we know it today, is a robust and unified nation, a living tapestry of cultures that stretch from the majestic peaks of the Alps in München to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This unique cultural blend can be felt from the bustling streets of Köln on the Rhine, through the heart of Germany, all the way to the elegant city of Dresden, nestled along the Elbe. Given this diversity, it's no surprise that Germany's identity has been shaped by various sources and tribes.\n\nThe land of the Germans was once known as Germania. The origins of its name are hotly debated among scholars. Tacitus, a Roman historian, suggested the name came from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought against the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes who often crossed the Rhine for warfare. The exact origin is uncertain, with some proposing it could come from the German spear, known as a ger, or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating that the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nEarly Roman historian Tacitus wrote in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that he believed the Germans were aboriginal, having not mixed with other races through immigration or contact. He wondered, who would leave the fertile lands of Asia or Africa to settle in Germany, with its harsh climate, rugged landscape, and stern people? The Romans, for their part, did not initially settle in Germania. They sent expeditions to trade with the Germanic tribes and occasionally led military campaigns, but they mostly returned to their sprawling empire. As Germanic tribes began emerging in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills with the Romans, and even serving in their army.",
            "I was staring down, my mind completely blank, trying to take in the view in front of me. Unemotionally, I studied the object, but I couldn't relate it to any deeper understanding. My thoughts were flowing in and out of my mind, so rapidly that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own. I was just experiencing the view as it was.\n\nOnce, on the advice of an artist I worked with, I bought a drawing book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had always wanted to learn how to draw since I was six, and this book teaches everything from understanding the pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it teaches is to frame any picture you want to study in a square. This way, a complex picture, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, becomes simpler and more manageable.\n\nBut when I looked at the bowl of fruit in front of me, I couldn't mentally frame it. I was so overwhelmed and awestruck that I could only stare in wonderment. Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, and Renaissance masters used a rainbow of colors. If I had any artistic aspirations, then the bowl of fruit before me was the beginning of my art, the start of my story, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers touched the brush, my muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand moved through the air. I was giving shape and form to my thoughts, perhaps the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Flakes of matter broke away and disappeared. My hand hit the toilet handle again, my muscles tensing and jerking more anxiously the second time. The clogged brown package refused to budge, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.\n\nWith a mop in hand, I stood, feet apart, a green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat. I frowned, staring at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter left as a message for the cleaning crew at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more introspective moments, then my hand reached for the sheet of toilet paper, wrapping it like an oven mitt. Standing up, bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother preparing the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Another devastating reality we face is the alarming number of teenagers dying in car accidents. Multiple factors combine to create this deadly scenario for the youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health explain that the teen brain is not yet equipped to handle the dangers of driving, exacerbated by the lack of experience. This inexperience leads to more fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. Teens fare even worse when they're behind the wheel with their peers, and studies confirm that the presence of passengers increases the likelihood of accidents.\n\nTo address this problem, states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers. However, these measures are insufficient. The core issue is that, as a group, teens simply aren't ready to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes that even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. He found that teens under 19-20 often crave the thrill of risk-taking, which makes it sensible to delay driving until these tendencies stabilize. Continuing to award licenses to young teens will likely result in more deadly accidents and a steep rise in the death toll among teen drivers in the coming years, especially as the Baby-Boomer’s babies become eligible to drive by 2010.\n\nLegislation to tackle this issue could be simple yet effective. Driver's education classes could continue in schools to start the learning process, but no one under 18 should operate a motor vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued before granting a full driver's license, with a set number of practical training hours required. The number of hours could be based on current state requirements, like California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice. To protect teens across the nation, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be sensible and effective.\n\nThe proposed legislation is not a groundbreaking idea, but a practical step towards reducing the number of teen driving fatalities.",
            "So I decided to dive into the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, specifically the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen in total. I spent my time describing the poetic elements of most of these trick films and examining the unique characteristics of a few from the later years.\n\nMost trick films from the turn of the century were confined to a stage, composed within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement. They used long and medium shots, adhering to the rule of one shot equaling one film. However, some films at the beginning of the twentieth century dared to deviate from these guidelines by introducing elements like multiple shots.\n\nOne common trait among these trick films was their filming in an interior set within a frontal proscenium. The camera remained stationary, rooted in its position, not moving to follow figures or objects. This style was deeply rooted in theatre and vaudeville traditions. As a result, characters in these films mainly moved side-to-side, never walking towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally across the frame, but the camera never tracks them.\n\nThis proscenium style also leads to long and medium shots being the norm, with close-ups being almost non-existent. This aligns with theatre and vaudeville practices, where audiences would see the entire performance at once, framed by the stage's borders. Characters, therefore, generally stayed in the middle ground and did not move towards the camera, making close-ups uncommon.\n\nMost early trick films followed the pattern of one conceptual shot per film. This constraint limited the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limited their dramatic or narrative potential; most focused on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts, with little story. However, it’s important to note that in these films, a single conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes might not equate to a single physical shot. A single “shot” could actually be several joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) as an example. Upon close inspection, you can see the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, was a staunch and early proponent of Republicanism. Agriculture, his primary profession, and his short stint in politics made him a formidable advocate for personal liberty and government transparency. His commitment to agrarianism was the cornerstone of his views on governance, impacting his stances on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and even the judicial system.",
            "Well, let me take a look back at Figure 17, and there it is, a steep decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. That was certainly a bit of a letdown, and it's tough to pinpoint exactly why it happened. I mean, we're in New England, so it's natural that with the onset of winter, folks just aren't as inclined to commute by bicycle or on foot. Then there's the end of the fall semester, where everyone's heads are down, focusing on wrapping up schoolwork and grades. And let's not forget, December is filled with holiday cheer, which means many don't even need to come campus for weeks. Classes pick back up for the spring semester in late January, adding to the drop. But that doesn't explain February's low numbers. It's like any new project, we had a boost at the start, but then it's natural to see a decline. So, to give things a kick, we rolled out the Carpool Challenge Week in March, and that brought back the log submissions. But it's a challenge to keep that momentum going, especially when you've got holiday breaks and semester slowdowns. Then there's the fact that people are just so used to driving their cars. It's a big part of our culture. So, we had to find ways to incentivize alternative commuting. We gave out a bunch of gift certificates to local shops and services. It would've been interesting to see how bigger prizes like a bicycle or hybrid car would've boosted engagement. We stuck with the gift cards initially, but maybe if we'd announced a few bicycles in December and then a hybrid car in January, we'd have seen more participation.",
            "So, you know what an ETF is? It's like a security that follows an index, commodity, or a bunch of assets, but trades like a stock on an exchange. It gives you the good stuff of an index fund with the perks of owning individual stocks, like selling short, buying on margin, and buying just a single share. Sounds great, right? Well, there's the downside—you have to pay a commission for every trade, just like you would with stocks.\n\nNow, let's talk about another awesome thing about ETFs—they come in so many flavors! But here's a heads up, you gotta be smart and evaluate if these benefits really exist and how much they do. For this, we're looking at the ETF IHF and its top ten holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Let's take a peek at those top ten holdings and their percentages.\n\nTo see how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF, we'll calculate their contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, using the current percentage of assets. Here's the chart:\n\nFrom the chart, it's clear that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could give you a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, and a Beta 0.12 lower. It seems like a portfolio of just these top 10 could be a better deal.\n\nBut wait, before we get too excited, we gotta check if these two portfolios are actually different. To do this, we'll look at the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, and see how it compares to the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's most highly regarded works is \"Dream-Land.\" Within this poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" which Mabbott traces back to the Roman poet Virgil. Virgil used this term in reference to an island north of Britain, the edge of the known world in Greek times. While Virgil's use of the term is undeniable, there's a more contemporary source that's often overlooked. Poe was deeply interested in German literature.\n\nThis point is crucial because it indicates Poe's familiarity with the works of Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws comparisons between Poe's and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe had imitated Goethe's style.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe's death, 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king who, after his wife's death, becomes a heavy drinker and eventually decides to end his own life. The similarities between the King of Thule and the description in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, perhaps a dark reflection of Poe's own experiences with loss and alcohol. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just one year before Poe's use of the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references \"ultra Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but he employs the term \"Thule\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" bookending the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a dark and lonely landscape, haunted by the memory of dead friends and a world devoid of color, mirroring the state of the King of Thule after his wife's death. The poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into one of Goethe's creations.\n\nGoethe was a significant author who Poe would have been familiar with, not only because of his respect for Tennyson but also due to the many reproductions of Goethe's works that were circulating at the time.",
            "So, let me give you the lowdown on a legal scenario. Under California law, could a customer who got hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages? This hypothetical customer, let's call them Jennifer Palmer, argues that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with malice because he was informed about the spill twice but chose to ignore it, delaying cleanup until he finished his dinner. Palmer could point to previous incidents where D&D customers had slipped and fallen, even though Martin was aware of the risk. The judge is unlikely to dismiss this claim outright because the evidence shows that Martin's actions were likely to cause harm and were intentional. However, the argument that his actions were despicable might be less convincing, given that there had been several slip-and-fall incidents in 2009, but still, Martin didn’t take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of his store. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee named Rich Wayne informed Martin about the apple spill, but Martin was on his dinner break and didn't want to deal with customer complaints. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill at 5:15 pm, but again, no action was taken. By 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell, suffering a serious back injury. D&D is now being sued for damages, and we are considering filing a motion to partially dismiss the punitive damage claim. In California, punitive damages can be awarded for conduct involving oppression, fraud, or malice. The law defines malice as conduct that intends to cause harm or, if there's no intent, conduct that's despicable and committed with a willful disregard for others' safety. The court has characterized conduct as malicious if the defendant was aware of the dangerous consequences and deliberately failed to avoid them. So, could Palmer's case be successful? Well, it's complicated, but it's definitely not a slam dunk.",
            "Just about four years back, I took a course on Islam at CBC. One of the main topics that sparked heated debates in class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion. I believe that this question is perhaps even more pertinent today than it was then. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I've witnessed a shift in the American media's portrayal of Islam, from a hostile view of extremists to an extreme form of tolerance. It's hard to imagine that in 2001, we could have ever seen a presidential candidate like Barak Obama, who has a Muslim background in his family, leading the conversation.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is quite fascinating. Based on what I know of his history, there seems to be a discrepancy between his biography and the personality I've come to understand. Before this course, I was under the impression that Muhammad forced converts to Islam. He would conquer tribes and force them to adopt the religion. However, the biography portrays him as a sort of martyr, misunderstood and even humble, who attracted people to his teachings without needing to compel them.\n\nMoreover, there are uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. For instance, when Muhammad multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men, it's a style of writing that makes me believe the authors wanted Muhammad to be seen as the humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything but simply lived in truth and miracles. This approach, to me, is problematic because it downplays the life and miracles of Jesus Christ. It's as if they're trying to steal and take credit for Jesus' life and personhood through Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, there are many stories in the biography that seem to serve as proof of 'witness' or how people 'naturally' converted to Islam. However, many of these stories are told from the perspective of third parties. The author illustrates that they heard it from someone who heard it from someone else, and so on. I found this approach less convincing because, although it aimed to authenticate the stories, it made them seem more dubious.\n\nWhat bothers me the most about this work is how it tries to elevate Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, historical accounts contradict this notion of Muhammad being a gentle and humble man. I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his beliefs during his lifetime were quickly abandoned in the development of Christian thought that came after his life. If we look at this history with a broad perspective, we see a trend of Christianity moving further and further away from its origin. Today's world shows a growing awareness and unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people might resist new ideas, they may not be influential enough to change the whole. Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow in future years. There will be a desire to differentiate between the doctrines added to Christianity over time from Jesus' original intent. This reversal in Christian history will take decades or even centuries, but it is inevitable. A movement will grow that will peel away layers of doctrine, one after another, as if the clock were moving backward, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity remains. When this trend spreads through the United States and Europe, influencing masses to worship as if they were living during Jesus' time, following only his ideas, the church will remain strong to lead the way. However, as the theological clock moves backward, the extreme diversity in Christendom will reverse into more uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of all kinds, we will see increasing similarities instead of differences. History is filled with great reversions. For example, Christians were once persecuted and killed by the Roman Empire, but later, the empire became a Christian institution. Our country has moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play out in the Christian religion, undoing history to find its source and undoing diversity in the process. This process will be made possible by a method of reading Jesus' words as metaphorical, not as literal statements. What happened since Jesus' lifetime? If we look far back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning of Christianity. Monotheism, the belief in a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were at the core by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not united, dividing into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I firmly believe that The Jungle demonstrates the intrinsic greed and self-centeredness of humans. At our core, we are driven to make our lives as comfortable and successful as possible, without much thought for those beneath us. This is evident in the behavior of the factory owners and managers, who prioritize their corporate interests above all else. They will stop at nothing to expand their empires, regardless of the harm caused to people or the environment. As Upton Sinclair describes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery illustrates the stark disregard these industrialists have for the pollution and suffering around them, including the animal waste and toxic fumes that poison the air and soil.\n\nThe factory owners also displayed no concern for their workers' well-being. They exploited them harshly, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They forced workers to labor long hours and abruptly fired them en masse for any reason, leaving them jobless and without compensation. During the time The Jungle is set, there were few legal protections for workers, allowing the owners to operate with impunity. Employees were expected to endure the terrible conditions and accept the constant threat of job loss, with no recourse or aid.\n\nThe lack of unions or support organizations in Packingtown further exacerbated the plight of the workers. While some unions were formed, they often proved more exploitative than helpful, lining their own pockets from the workers' misfortune. This system of exploitation and oppression reduced workers to a state of near-slavery, with their lives and opportunities entirely at the mercy of the factory owners, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many writers employ various methods to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers regarding significant subjects. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs adjectives and nouns in unusual ways to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. Other times, he ascribes symbolic significance to colors, which he later uses to convey feelings about certain objects. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald imbues colors like white/gray and red/pink with meaning and uses these meanings to evoke feelings about important subjects.\n\nFitzgerald's association of white/gray with uniformity is particularly notable. He establishes this meaning early in the novel by frequently using these colors. Daisy and Jordan are often described as \"in white\" (8), and nearly everyone at Gatsby's party wears white, including Nick in \"white flannels\" (41), Tom in a \"white shirt\" (36), and Catherine as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exceptions are when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where he notices \"gaudy primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald also uses white/gray to describe common or unremarkable subjects, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray old man\" (27) selling dogs. After building up these associations, Fitzgerald employs white/gray to signify uniformity or insignificance. This technique begins with Daisy, whom he describes as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster,\" making her seem less like a character and more like a uniform object Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald employs this approach with Daisy repeatedly, further emphasizing her uniformity, as seen in her \"gray haze\" and later in a white dress (115) before her encounter with Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County's mild, sunny climate makes it a powerhouse in agriculture. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers flourish here. There's a thriving demand for organic, community-supported agriculture in the area, with many local organizations boasting long waiting lists for produce. Organic eggs and milk are also popular among locals. Many organic farms offer tours and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching, generating additional income and educational opportunities.\n\nOrganic farming, while offering greater biodiversity and habitat improvement, comes with higher costs. It demands more intensive labor and management to control pests and weeds without chemicals. Losses can be higher, and small farms lack the economies of scale of larger operations. Non-organic practices beneficial to wildlife, like planting cover crops, strategic grazing, and invasive species removal, also come at a labor cost. Therefore, a landowner in this situation might seek financial assistance or expertise to optimize profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe chosen property is a 160-acre parcel in Potrero, San Diego County, California, featuring chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland near the Cleveland National Forest. It's part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion under the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which lists over a hundred species, many of them endangered or declining, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, certain butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nNative Americans inhabited this land for centuries, followed by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This land was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production. I chose this property from a real estate website, researching available government programs to help a small farmer mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. An organic farm in the same area serves as a model for what this land could achieve.",
            "Culture plays a big role in any negotiation. It's not just about what culture is, but also what it isn't and what it stands for. Culture isn't uniform and isn't just national or international; it varies from place to place. Sayings like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are too broad. A better approach is to understand how a culture's attitude can affect negotiations. When meeting a foreign culture, you naturally compare it to your own, which is natural. To understand a culture, you might look at its history or its prejudices. Don't judge or try to change it; instead, work within its boundaries, especially if you're at a weaker bargaining position. If you're in a foreign environment, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome barriers. It's also important to remember that a culture isn't just national—many companies within a nation have their own corporate culture, which can affect dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. For example, some companies encourage philanthropy while others restrict it. Even in American culture, corporate attitudes vary widely. Some cultures may appear more uniform but are still worth digging deeper into. Values are crucial too, as they explain why a culture is the way it is. If saving face is important in a culture, you won't publicly shame your company or superior to win a negotiation. A hard-driven bargain might be more important in another culture, so not settling early is key. Understanding these cultural nuances before negotiations begins is important, but also learning about your opponent personally can make negotiations more effective.",
            "Okay, so here's a familiar quote, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’\" This is from Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and it's the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. This idea is also shared by another author, Thomas Aquinas. Since we're comparing their arguments, we'll assume both are right about the existence of a god, particularly the one from the Bible. Otherwise, comparing their arguments wouldn't make sense. Now, while they both have valid points, neither really provides a complete reason to believe in this God.\n\nLet's start with St. Anselm's basic argument. He suggests that you can find proof of God's existence within your own mind. It's all about understanding through faith. He says that since God is within our understanding, we can't doubt his existence. This is a bit wordy, but essentially, he's saying that God is proven by what we already know within our own minds. No outside evidence needed, that's what faith is all about.\n\nNow, Thomas Aquinas takes a different approach. He believes you can prove God's existence through reason and empirical evidence, no faith required. This would be great for bringing in new converts, as they could be convinced by logic alone. He presents five different logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument shows that God's existence is a logical necessity. It's like saying, if you know you're missing one piece of a puzzle, you can figure out what it looks like without actually seeing it.\n\nSo, in short, both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas bring up good points, but neither provides a solid, complete reason to believe in God.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince known as Siddhartha Gautama was born. He later became Buddha and his teachings gave birth to Buddhism, with the most traditional branch being Theravada. The religion has been around for nearly 2500 years, growing and changing over time. You can see this evolution in places like Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. While Buddha didn't teach about such a ceremony, monks and laypeople still participate, illustrating how the religion has evolved. This evolution isn't limited to superficial practices but also extends to its core beliefs. The Theravada community has had to adapt their doctrines, influenced by both internal and external factors, both hostile and benign.\n\nThroughout this discussion, I'll use several key terms. Internal forces refer to those from within the Buddhist community, regardless of whether they are monks or laypeople. External forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm or damage Buddhism, driven by a negative perception. Benign forces, on the other hand, don't necessarily wish to support or harm the Buddhist community but might do so incidentally.\n\nBefore diving in, let's understand Theravada Buddhism's core principles. Buddhists take refuge in the Triple Gem—the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka sets out rules for life, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts is key to escaping Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and overcoming lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides rules for laypeople and monks. Laypeople follow five precepts, while monks have many more rules to abide by. The most fundamental belief in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: life is Dukkha (suffering), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and there is a path to enlightenment.",
            "The United States and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the U.S. defeated Mexico and gained Texas and the American Southwest. There were other disputes between the two nations, which persisted until the First World War. The rivalry originated from disagreements on religion, culture, and tradition, as well as differing material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis is similar to how many other nations have enduring rivalries with their neighbors, often driven by shared borders and conflicting interests. The U.S. and Mexico are not unique in this regard, with David M. Pletcher (1977) noting that only Mexico and Cuba have had long-lasting overarching American diplomatic issues (p. 41). These nations are geographically close to the U.S. and have historically been rivals, unlike most other Latin American countries which have maintained good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences have often been a source of tension between nations, a trend seen throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) highlights that in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy (p.86), much like the Cold War rivalry between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which was partly ideological and partly a competition over vital interests. However, in this case, the ideological strife was rooted in religious preferences rather than political structures. This mistrust stemmed from the historical enmity between the English and Spanish, which made establishing friendly foreign relations difficult.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes were territorial issues, involving border raids and frontier problems. Bandit and outlaw attacks from American border towns were a significant issue until both nations employed military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nThe rivalry began to fade as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the U.S., and finally ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico later in the 19th century (Schmitt 1974, p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly struck down by an illness I had never known existed. I was a nurse, having chosen this profession out of a deep longing for the safety and security I hadn't experienced as a child. The mantra \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick\" echoed through my adolescence and beyond. Despite dreaming of a career in science or journalism, I opted for nursing. Yet, here I am: 46 years old, single, with no financial stability and unable to work. My disability persists, and after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability, I have little left to call my own. Each day is a struggle, a relentless assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, but one thing is clear: I couldn't have endured for all these years without the support of my family and a few trusted friends. And let me tell you, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nThe lesson here is that life is filled with emergencies, both big and small. No amount of preparation can guarantee that you'll overcome everything on your own. I wholeheartedly agree that we should cease relying solely on big government. I'd much rather see Americans learn to trust one another again, to help each other and to ask for help, rather than each of us retreating to our backyards to build fallout shelters.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often talk about \"rugged individualism\" as the force that built this country. But the truth is, our forefathers didn't cross the Rockies in wagon trains alone. It was compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that saw them through hard times.\n\nSo, do prepare. I have supplies: a disaster kit with first aid, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape, flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm, and the ability to can or preserve food, do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment. But while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms change over time? Are there any limitations or rules that dictate how they evolve? While in 1917 D'Arcy Thompson noted that “Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,” the same can be said today. Modern mathematical modeling has been applied to study mollusk skeletogenesis through both development and evolution, as seen in works by Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our research explores how combining mathematical modeling and experimental studies can help understand the mechanisms driving evolutionary and developmental change in Prunum. We analyzed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative traits, which were entered into the software program CerioShell. By creating hypothetical shell morphologies, we aimed to interpret the limits of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events within this group.\n\nImagine a shell as a structure that spirals through 360 degrees of space over time, forming a coiled structure called a whorl. These whorls turn around an imaginary central column, known as the columella, which runs through the shell's center. The rate at which whorls grow can vary, and the line separating each whorl is called a suture. Most shells have the largest whorl as the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire includes all whorls except the last, with the apex at the top and the base at the bottom. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles: apical (top), basal (bottom), apertural (front), and abapertural (back). The usual orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical side and identify where the first suture starts. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts and count whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. This movement can be traced using coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture along with horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, parameters can be varied to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Another month has come and gone, and despite the lack of significant changes in my life, a few notable events have transpired. Indonesia's progress on reducing neonatal and infant mortality over the past decade has been lackluster, despite making strides towards meeting some Millennium Development Goals. Specifically, the target goals for child and maternal health are far from being met by the 2015 deadline. Several factors contribute to this, suggesting that the overall health system needs bolstering rather than just programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen improvements in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% meeting this criterion. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions in complicated pregnancies, leading to a high number of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. This improvement is somewhat misleading, and there's still much work to be done. Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional, and the data on postnatal care is incomplete, indicating a concerning trend.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain below the expected level, at about 4%. Urban areas have a c-section rate of 7%, compared to just 2% in rural settings. This highlights the issue of healthcare equity, as services are primarily concentrated in urban areas. There's also a stark difference in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, with a 27% gap, pointing to difficulties for the poor in accessing healthcare services due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering how to tackle the lack of service in improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is whether Indonesia should focus on program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system. While programmatic approaches offer targeted and manageable objectives and faster results, they can lead to funding imbalances, resource allocation issues, and duplication of services. The challenge lies in determining the most effective path forward.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous detail and fixation on the aristocracy of the era. Notably, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights deviate from this norm, incorporating mystery and eccentricity to enrich the characters and their motivations.  The two novels often employ dreamlike elements to convey a sense of unease and confusion, which helps to deepen the reader's understanding of the characters' emotions and inner turmoil.\n\n\"Suddenly, a cacophony of bewildering and disorientating ideas flooded his mind. He seemed to be walking with Sikes and Crackit, who were engaged in a heated argument. Their voices echoed in his ears, as if they were happening right then. Abruptly, he realized he was speaking to them. Then, a report of gunfire echoed through the air, and a rush of lights and shouts filled his vision. He was being swiftly carried away by an unseen force. Through this flurry of images, a constant, gnawing awareness of pain lingered, tormenting him.\n\nHis experience with the shooting, revisited in Chapter 28, was revisited in a vivid dream-like state as he struggled to seek help. This passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events and the desperate state of his health, evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself numbed all his senses, and he did not even notice the 'unseen hand' that bore him away. The pain was now a constant, linked with fear rather than surprise. This experience raises questions about whose will brought about his misfortune, as it certainly wasn't his own. This shooting highlights Oliver's lack of control over his life, as he couldn't even attempt to influence the outcome, even as his life was in jeopardy, a growing sense of defeat is implied, suggesting that Old Fagin had begun to break his spirit, forcing him to accept despair and limiting his ability to react. Had Oliver not been in such a state, he might have made some effort to save himself.\n\n'The day passed – a day? It was gone before it came, and night returned, long and silent, yet fleeting in its duration. The night was a long, dreadful silence, yet short in its passing.'\"",
            "A couple of years ago, I worked at an after-school program tutoring elementary students. I did my best to assist them with their subjects, but my strengths were in English and reading. I was asked by one of the instructors to help a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. He seemed to have peculiar reading issues. He could pronounce some letters perfectly while others were way off. I realized something was wrong; he was of Latino descent, yet he spoke perfect English. We struggled until I met his mother. She spoke only Spanish. With my limited Spanish skills, we communicated, and that's when it hit me: Adrian could read but didn't know the English alphabet well. I'm not sure if this revelation helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the challenges of the language barrier in schools, especially in California. Even if a child speaks perfect English, reading it can still be difficult. This problem is evident, and so what do we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was straightforward: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There is no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—no single solution will fix this problem. The key is to combine all these approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a fantastic idea. It's beneficial not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all kids. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" Many fears surround this idea, that it's a waste of resources and that most children won't benefit. But this isn't true. If we implemented these programs more widely, all children would reap the benefits. How do we do this? Should all teachers be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic. However, there's no reason we can't have bilingual aides or tutors to support these programs.",
            "Just as we grow up, many of us are told from a young age that there is something greater than ourselves, something beyond our comprehension. Some of us are introduced to this concept through Sunday school, others through Temple, or we explore it within ourselves. Some readily accept the beliefs passed down by our parents, while others reject them entirely, denying the existence of anything beyond our personal experiences. Our journey to define part of ourselves often involves spiritual exploration, searching for a guiding light to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun. “A cardinal,” my father replied when I asked him about his favorite bird. We sat on the front porch, listening to the rain pour down, while we smoked our cigarettes. He looked out into the rain, as if looking back in time. He had become frail, his clothes loose on his body, and his hair sparse. He gazed into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him, as it would only make it more real. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall on the June twilight. My father passed away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. Chemotherapy and radiation did not ease his suffering but prolonged it a few months. I could not watch him pass away, as I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news. No one called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel,\" as described by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, is essentially a blend of \"Old-New,\" much like an oxymoron. The Gothic genre has been both criticized and celebrated, often accused of lacking depth and praised for its \"terrible sublime\" atmosphere (Burke). The original Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, merged the elements of both ancient and modern romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new form of literary expression. Walpole incorporated old theatrical elements and the mimicry of nature in modern novels to present a \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often references medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various cultures, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to modern societal and literary advancements. The fusion of traditional Gothic elements and the new format of the novel, allowing readers a more personal view of characters' psychology, is what has kept the Gothic genre relevant for so long, making it both obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from the original era.\n\nA key concept in Gothic novels is the idea of Chivalry. The medieval concept of knightly training and the chivalric ideal, both retained and transformed in The Castle of Otranto, are central to Gothic literature. Chivalry was important to Gothic writers because it represented the classic knight—brave, honorable, and competent—contrasted with their perceived lack of these qualities in contemporary society. By using chivalric themes and manners, the Gothic past is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the evolution of Gothic to Romanticism and serving as a means to improve the present. Walpole, writing during a politically tumultuous time, may have felt that the supposed morality and inherent goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in society. This is evident in his characters, like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits. Before meeting Frederic, he is described as:",
            "Supply chain management is the sequence of processes moving goods from the order point to the final delivery to the customer. The term was coined by Keith Oliver, a consultant, in 1982. He described it as the planning, implementation, and control of everything that occurs within the supply chain to satisfy customer needs quickly and efficiently. Six key elements make up a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these elements to deliver top-notch customer service.\n\nFirst among these elements is production, the backbone of the supply chain. This stage lays out when, where, how, and why products will be produced. Managers must understand what customers want, which they can determine by examining the market. Once they analyze the market and grasp customer demand, they can decide which products to produce and in what quantities. After setting production targets and choosing the best facilities, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Every detail is crucial in production, as improper planning can lead to significant time and money losses. For instance, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business had a designated process, from employee uniform design to receiving shipments. Clear, outlined processes ensure smooth operations without confusion or mismatches in expectations.\n\nThe second key element is supply, which involves strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with unique equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division best suits each part of the product process. They may also choose to outsource work to other companies to achieve velocity – the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while keeping costs low.",
            "Just today, I saw a peculiar sign in the street. It read, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, the star of Juno, stood alone on the corner, holding a piece of cardboard with this ominous message. Burma, or Myanmar as it's also known, is a Southeast Asian country that's been under the iron grip of a tyrannical military junta since 1962, when they seized power through a coup d'état. In 2007, street protests erupted, led by Burmese monks, marking the first public demonstrations in a decade. These protests, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution,\" initially saw peaceful gatherings but soon escalated into violent clashes between the monks and the military junta, with monasteries being ransacked and foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai, being imprisoned or even killed, like on September 27th, 2007. The official death toll stands at 13, but a defected colonel from the army suggests the real number could be in the thousands.\n\nThis isn't an isolated incident. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, and even our current president, George W. Bush, is said to consult with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a branch of the Republican Party. Notable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, workers, and students were killed in the hundreds to thousands. There was also the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups and the government systematically murdered Tutsis and political moderates, irrespective of ethnicity. And who can forget Hitler's Third Reich, where Jews were systematically rounded up and killed across several countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is largely due to his endurance and his ability to mold his orchestra. His piano presence is often subtle in his compositions, but as a composer, Ellington excelled at creating intricate and deep pieces that highlighted the individual skills of his band members. Ellington crafted a framework where soloists could freely improvise and wrote tightly arranged pieces and phrases that showcased the unique style of each band member, emphasizing the overall tone of the orchestra to create consistent and original sounds for each piece. His mastery of individual players' sounds and how they complemented each other in a growing ensemble allowed him to write some of jazz history's most innovative and brilliant works. The Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington’s use of voice as an instrument, with Creole Love Call being an early example of this. This piece uses voice to add texture and color without lyrics, and also showcases Ellington's ability to complement his soloists, a trait evident throughout his career. Creole Love Call features six choruses, each with distinct elements such as voice and reed call and response, muted trumpet solos, and full band echoes. Ellington's use of voice to add tone color is just one of his stylistic traits that permeate his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines tight orchestration with an ear for tone color. He uses a call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, with Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton playing a key role in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Another day had passed, and I'd been feeling that persistent itch again, that gnawing need for something, anything. This sensation had been a constant companion since I hit puberty, now three years strong. It started as a desire for things, but had morphed into a craving for someone. Yet, the right someone had eluded me. Boys had shown interest, but none had sparked anything within me. I'd spent years puzzling over this peculiar predicament, but it was a mystery that remained unsolved. So, I carried on with life, my mind a whirlwind of questions and curiosity.\n\nA typical day at home was usually a peaceful symphony, with my parents as the calm conductors. They never raised their voices, and their daughter was a rare fly in the ointment. Arguments were few and far between, except for my insistence on asserting my independence. I was a likeable, nice girl, but my spirited personality was a stark contrast to my parents' calm demeanor.\n\nToday, however, was far from that usual serenity. As I wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration for my own soul, a shriek from the kitchen pierced the air. My mother's voice echoed through the house, and I rushed to the kitchen, heart pounding. \"Mom? Mom, what's wrong?!\" I shouted, panic rising. My mother lay on the floor, groaning and clutching her side. \"Ow... sweetie... I... need you to take me to the hospital,\" she managed to say, her words rushed and pained. I quickly gathered her, cradling her in my arms, and carried her to the car. That morning's leisurely walk transformed into a mad dash to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital's sterile scent filled my nostrils, but my mind was too focused on helping my mother. I rushed her to the triage, calling for assistance. A flurry of medical personnel surrounded us, taking her away to be evaluated. I was left to wait, worry gnawing at me.\n\nMom had fallen from a stepladder while trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet in the house.",
            "Another study has revealed that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), shown by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed), is linked to a lower risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as reduced stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a tweaked version of the Med diet, with more plants like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, more monounsaturated fats compared to saturated ones, and less animal products and saturated fats. Drinking alcohol in moderation is also part of the diet.\n\nPrevious research has indicated that following the Med diet lowers the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality and is better than a low-fat diet for weight loss and lowering cholesterol levels in those who are overweight. However, previous studies didn’t focus on the risk of stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study observed over 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, with no prior history of heart disease or diabetes, from the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort of nurses in 11 US states. Six times, over 20 years from 1984 to 2004, they calculated an aMed diet score based on food intake reported by the nurses. Over 95% of the nurses participated throughout the study. To ensure reliability, the reported data and health outcomes were verified by medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Body mass index (BMI), smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were also tracked, and starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo account for variations in individual food intake, an average aMed score from the repeated food frequency questionnaires was calculated. Adjustments were made for factors that could affect the results, such as age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing the Cox proportional-hazard model, the study examined the relationship between the aMed diet score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal cases.\n\nThe research found that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, there were 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the top aMed group had a lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest group (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America was struck by a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market tanked, and some of the country’s most significant corporations were left in shambles. This recession continues to this day, so let's delve into how this happened and how we can prevent it from recurring. In essence, the financial crisis was the result of self-serving and naive political choices that compelled banks and firms to issue sub-prime loans, further stressing an already fragile and insufficient financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to back and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks found themselves short on capital reserves, passing the chaos to the repacked mortgages they had sold, and onward to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to the Clinton era in 1999. The President was in the midst of a reelection bid, aiming to bolster his popularity by relaxing lending restrictions. This move laid the groundwork for the sub-prime crisis that would unfold seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999 that, “Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest mortgage underwriter, was under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals and faced pressure from shareholders to maintain its remarkable profit growth.” Holmes accurately predicted the repercussions of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation could face trouble in a downturn, necessitating a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As mentioned in the introduction and foreseen by Holmes, ill-advised lending would indeed plunge the economy into crisis.\n\nSeveral factors combined to send the economy spiraling, one of which was the intricate structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, further intertwining different sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets becoming overly leveraged in the housing market, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had purchased mortgage-backed securities in financial misery. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt by 2007, which represented about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to become commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Exposition, that's the part of your story where you stretch out your writer's wings and take flight, or perhaps you just bore your readers to tears. Dr. Merlin's been known to shout at her screen when she finds herself stuck in \"Too Much Information,\" not in a good way.\n\nMy gentle readers know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages where nothing happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is the little devil on your shoulder saying, \"Get the history out of the way to get to the good parts,\" not to be confused with the other devil urging you to tell your audience every single detail of your characters' pasts.\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose. In film, it's when a character dumps information on another, like the Ancient Mariner. In fiction, it's you doing the telling.\n\nAn example: As you read, you're told the heroine met her beloved, they married, and he died in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this to take two pages with minimal dialogue. You'd expect the author to show the husband's character through words and actions, to feel his love for her. You'd expect to see their bond grow, to understand her thoughts and dreams through his eyes, and so mourn his death with her, growing closer to her.\n\nIn short, you'd expect more substance to the story's skeleton: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that substance. Sometimes it's tempting to rush past things. Maybe you're introducing a new character and you know he was in the Air Force, now runs a gas station, was married twice, no kids, loves fishing, secretly dreams of owning the station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and",
            "I caught two news segments from Columbus, Ohio today, August 13, 2011. The first was a live broadcast from NBC 4. The main story was about a bloke named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. Not much about her, but they showed his mug shot and he looked like he was straight out of a bad horror movie. They only gave it about two minutes, which seemed about right given it was still an unfolding story. The second story was about some kid named Travis Buyers, 18, who got shot in the Sharon Woods area and was in critical condition. They didn't have any arrests yet and the SWAT team was on the case. This story was a bit short, which might have been because it was a \"black\" man or a black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that minorities get less coverage when they're victims of a crime. If it's a white child or adult, the media goes nuts, but minorities are lucky if they even get a mention. The next story was about finding a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. They said it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the chopper. Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. The storm updates were next; they said Saturday's afternoon would have rain and thunderstorms, with temperatures in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. They kept it brief but it was a teaser to keep you watching. They also had a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. A dark-skinned black man robbed the store, they emphasized his blackness and how dark he was. Another guy named Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin, was sentenced for conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts from Texas to Ohio. They strangely used \"300 months\" instead of \"25 years\" in prison. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, but I don't think that was relevant to the story.",
            "The bond between brothers is something special; a tie that cannot be easily broken. This bond is a canvas for many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers have a unique understanding of each other, a connection that goes deeper than any other relationship. This bond is most visible in times of crisis, where the true nature of their feelings for one another becomes clear, whether it is for good or for ill. The consequences of these emotions are significant, and understanding them is key to navigating this complex relationship. When one brother looks into the eyes of another, they see not just their sibling but a reflection of themselves. Their actions and the results of their actions reveal their true character. This theme is beautifully depicted in \"The Scarlet Ibis\", where two brothers embark on an ill-fated journey through a lush, vividly described landscape. The story is told through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex feelings and his view of the world. These feelings heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, tragic journey, the protagonist feels a sense of resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother who could share his worldly skills, like holding breath underwater, running, jumping, or climbing trees. He wanted a brother who could join him in adventures like running to Horsehead Landing or perching in the tall pine tree behind the barn. However, Doodle's condition—an extremely weak heart—made these dreams unachievable. The protagonist's dreams were shattered, and he felt anger towards the child. He even considered smothering Doodle with a pillow to end his life. What kind of child would have such thoughts? However, his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him. This simple act of love gave him hope, showing that his conviction to harm Doodle was not strong. In the back of his mind, he still loved his brother, despite his resentment.",
            "The human brain is a complex, innovative information processing system. Over the ages, as technology evolved from primitive to modern, so did the metaphors used to understand the brain. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and more recently, a computer. As you explore the brain, keep in mind that these metaphors, while useful, can also lead to misconceptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs, which convert physical sensations like touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. These signals are transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when you see a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing integrates simple information like color and orientation to identify it as a box. Top-down processing then supports this recognition, helping you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole.\n\nOnce information is processed, an attention filter determines its importance and directs it to the relevant cognitive processes. For example, your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, but a healthy attention filter discards these details, allowing you to focus on your name even in a noisy room. This filtering happens at various stages.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first be stored. Memory exists in different forms: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded based on its type, such as structurally for visual stimuli or phonemically for auditory ones. Verbal input can be encoded semantically, referring to its meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Working memory, which holds data for about 20 seconds, is maintained by electrical signals looping through neurons. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained by structural changes in specific proteins.\n\nThere are various models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, influenced by human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model suggests that concepts (nodes) are connected based on their relatedness. For example, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley, in his novel Brave New World, takes aim at the encroaching threat of technology and the capitalist structure that reinforces it, painting a grim picture of a dystopian future. In this world, people prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned since birth to seek instant happiness above all else. The citizens are mere pawns in a larger game, confined to a single ideology imposed by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, Huxley's suspicions about the faults in the emerging economic system become evident. Terms like homogeny and reification highlight the societal conditioning that mirrors the faults of the capitalist system he sees around him.\n\nCapitalism is mocked through the concept of false consciousness, where the common people are kept unaware of their true economic relations, focusing solely on personal gain. This control is evident in the conditioning of Brave New World's citizens, who are driven to consume, spend, and indulge. This is manipulated by the World Controller, a form of hegemony where lower classes are unaware of their oppression, while upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, mostly accept their designated roles. The interactions between different classes are significant indicators of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nBrave New World presents a society where individual relationships are superficial and lack depth. Characters are indistinguishable from one another, suggesting that technology and capitalism strip people of their free will and expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent; interactions are kept shallow, with men focusing on women's physical attributes and women discussing their encounters without shame. This complacency with one's social status is a reflection of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are convinced of their superiority as long as they consume and conform to societal norms.",
            "So another semester has gone by, and here I am, still trudging along at University Park. It's been two and a half years since I started here, or four and a half semesters. Navigating this campus can be a real pain, especially when you're stuck in the farthest reaches, like East Halls. Back in my freshman year, I was all the way east, practically at the edge of the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. A 25-minute walk to classes in the Willard building, especially in bad weather, was a real chore. I found out from an alum that not too long ago, East Halls was separated from the rest of the campus by vast empty fields. Now that space is filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments, and campus expansion is making it even harder to get around. So, what's the solution? Bikes, of course! But they're only useful if students use them, and the campus needs to be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nI was chatting with a friend who recently picked up cycling after a few years off. He said, “Bikes are great, for a few years it wasn't cool to ride, but it's the most efficient way to get around.” Plus, they're good for your body. Just a bowl of oatmeal and a little effort can take you 30 miles or more. I live off campus now, as far from the center as some dorms. The smartest move I've made this year was buying a bike. Classes at Thomas building take 25 minutes to walk, but on a bike, it cuts that down to 5 minutes if you pedal hard. The only downside is Pollock Road, the straightest route from my house to Thomas, isn't always the easiest to ride. Still, I'd rather bike than walk, as it saves me an extra 30-40 minutes every day, which adds up to over two and a half hours a week. If I didn't have a bike, walking would be my only option, and that's just not feasible with my busy schedule."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal.

The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "So, I'm all set to dive into an education in social work. My dream is to work with the Division of Family and Children Services, helping kids who have been abused or neglected, and providing support for troubled families. I've got some core values that I think I can bring to the social work field: service, respect, ethical nature, and a commitment to improving relationships between people, as well as my own professional growth. These values aren't just for the job; they're deeply personal to me too.\n\nI've always had a heart for helping others, but I wasn't sure what career path to take. Throughout high school and college, I saw many people shying away from their problems and using coping mechanisms that weren't ideal. These experiences led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break from my studies. One summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy nervously sitting on her couch. Turns out, he was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parents’ house. I offered to help, driving over to the house to talk to the police. They asked me to talk to the parents, as there was nothing they could do legally for the teenager. The parents seemed nervous and blamed their son for involving outsiders to resolve simple disputes. After this, I started seriously considering a career in social work to help kids with family conflicts.\n\nAnother key value in social work is social justice. Our society claims to value the individual, but often we follow archaic traditions rather than truly embracing uniqueness. If we mourn lost individuals, why strive to be like everyone else? I am an individual and I don't want to limit myself based on what others are doing. Throughout my years in high school and college, I stood up against social injustice in many ways: unnatural hair colors, unique clothing choices, ear piercings, involvement with GSBA, fighting against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will continue to protest injustices I see.",
            "So here's a quick rundown of what the paper's all about. It's a deep dive into Biological and Sociocultural models and their take on insomnia. The Biological model zeros in on the genetic and health aspects, like how genes and medical conditions can mess with sleep. Meanwhile, the Sociocultural model looks at environmental factors, including race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review takes a closer look at insomnia through these lenses, breaking down each piece of research to explain how it relates to these models. It also critiques the strengths and weaknesses of these studies.\n\nSleep disorders come in all shapes and sizes. You've got primary sleep disorders like dyssomnias or parasomnias, which are standalone issues. Sleep disorders tied to another mental disorder usually fall under Axis I or Axis II disorders, which cover things like clinical and personality disorders. There's also sleep disorders linked to medical complications or substance intake. Let's break down the dyssomnias a bit: Primary Insomnia is when you can't get enough sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is when you can't stay awake. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are behavioral and physical issues that happen during sleep, like Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The review focuses on insomnia, and it dabbles a bit in primary sleep disorders in general.\n\nNow, the Biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, inherited traits, and physiological factors. Neurons in the hypothalamus, which produce orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that GABAB receptors on these neurons control sleep-wake states. When these receptors are activated, they promote sleep, and if they're not firing correctly, it can cause reduced anxiety and sleep disturbances. A GABAB agonist, baclofen, extended sleep time in the study (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests that what's happening in mice can be similar in humans, showing a genetic and environmental basis for sleep disorders. If there's a problem with these receptors, it could impact sleep without medication, affecting life aspects like school, career, and routine tasks.",
            "This paper delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD): a brief definition, diagnosis, and strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to assist students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) is essentially a breakdown in the brain's ability to process sounds we hear. In other words, people with CAPD can hear normally, but their brain struggles to translate and understand sounds, particularly in noisy environments or when distinguishing between words. This disorder is often referred to as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) and was first identified in the mid-1950s, when researchers termed it \"auditory imperception.\" The journey to understanding CAPD includes pivotal contributions from researchers like Kimura and a national conference in 1977.\n\nSymptoms of CAPD vary but can include difficulty hearing sounds in space, distinguishing between sounds, recognizing sound patterns, and detecting changes in speech. People with CAPD might also struggle with sound synthesis, where they can't interpret sounds meaningfully, and may have trouble determining the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosis involves thorough screening by professionals like audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. Tests range from simple questionnaires to advanced acoustic signal recordings. It's important to note that there's no single, foolproof test or known cause for CAPD.\n\nTo support a student with CAPD in a mainstream classroom, teachers can adopt various strategies. These might include reducing background noise, clearly enunciating instructions, and providing visual aids. Encouraging the student to face the teacher or use assistive listening devices can also help. The key is to create an environment that minimizes auditory distractions and maximizes understanding.",
            "So what do you think about Shakespeare's Twelfth Night and the whole business of disguise? Well, it seems that while dressing up as someone else might be useful for pulling off a long con, in the end, you've got to shed that disguise or risk losing yourself. But watch out, 'cause when you finally come clean, you might find yourself all alone, cut off from the people you care about. After all, some folks might just take it in stride, but others, well, they might not be too happy about being fooled. And let's talk about gender swap deception, 'cause that's got its own set of issues. So why do people feel the need to hide behind a disguise? Take Viola for example. She's new in town, so she decides to masquerade as a man to keep herself safe. Her plan works, but it also makes her feel alienated from other women, and to top it all off, Olivia ends up falling in love with her. And don't even get me started on the whole Viola-Cesario-Orsino thing. It's like Viola is trapped in this love triangle, and she's the only one who doesn't know what's going on. You'd think that Shakespeare was trying to show us how deception can help release hidden emotions, but when you dig deeper, it's like Olivia is just judging people based on what they look like. I mean, she goes from being smitten with Cesario to acting like Viola is her sister. It's like she can't make up her mind. So yeah, deception can have some weird effects on people, but at the end of the day, it's all about choices. Do you risk losing yourself, or do you risk losing the people you care about?",
            "German colonial rule has been widely noted for its harshness, particularly the genocide committed against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, it's crucial to remember that nothing as vast as a colonial empire can be explained through a single description. The German colonial empire was as diverse in its policies and ruling styles as it was in its geography. Educational provision across the colonies varied greatly. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a significant population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also commended by contemporary authors. The situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike in East Africa, where the government played a major role in educating the locals, in South West Africa, native education was largely left to missionary societies that received minimal government support. The government did, however, invest heavily in educating Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and providing significant support to missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies boasted substantial numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper seeks to delve deeper into these factors and focus on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. There is a substantial body of literature on education within the German colonial empire, with many of these sources written in German and dating from the early 20th century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. Early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems in these colonies, while later works expanded this discourse through comparative studies and more detailed analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant differences across the colonies' educational systems. Cohen’s study on education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly notable. Cohen compared the educational systems of both colonies and discussed the factors contributing to the differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounted for many of the colony’s educational system's distinctive features. Compared to other German colonial possessions, South West Africa had a climate that was generally more temperate, with large portions covered by arid desert. This moderated climate attracted a relatively substantial European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population, had only 5,336 whites.",
            "So, over the past 100 years, the classification of pop music has expanded to include countless genres, making it a challenge to list them all. To make matters more complex, most, if not all genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres. Within this vast landscape, the sub-genre of heavy metal rock has proven to be one of the most diverse and expressive, with a history of innovation dating back 40 years.\n\nToday, heavy metal has evolved into a genre with countless niches, making it difficult to define what it truly is. It has absorbed themes and influences from numerous other genres, but it all started somewhere. To comprehend the heavy metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp the essence of the metal movement and why it is more than just a genre.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is defined by its darkness. It's often dubbed a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. It's less primitive and more skilled, with metal bands often showcasing exceptional instrumental prowess. Additionally, metal is heavily associated with drug use. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s led to the creation of some of the genre's most iconic, otherworldly records. This drug influence has also been a significant factor in the movement's dark, visceral qualities, which were somewhat novel in the context of popular music at the time. Furthermore, later generations have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements of the Romantic Era, as seen in lyrics like these from Helter Skelter by The Beatles:\n\nThese lyrics demonstrate the darker side of The Beatles, exhibiting an up-and-down rhythm that some attribute to drug use. This song is often considered one of the first heavy metal tracks, serving as a response to a heavier, darker Rolling Stones song. The Beatles aimed to prove they could be as heavy as the Stones, resulting in this iconic track on The White Album.",
            "Once upon a time, long before the Surrealist artists painted their dreamlike masterpieces, there was Henri Rousseau, an artist who literally and figuratively crafted his own dreams. The Dream, a 1910 piece by the Post-Impressionist artist, isn't just about a woman in awe of her dreamt land; it's a reflection of Rousseau's personal dreams and aspirations as a painter. He dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but faced a tough internal struggle: should he conform to or mimic certain painting styles to gain acceptance, or forge his own unique path?\n\nBefore diving into The Dream, let's explore Rousseau's life story. Born in Laval, northwest France, on May 21, 1844, he was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer. He grew up without formal art training and worked as a gabelou (municipal toll employee) until he was 40. After his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their infant children passed away, Rousseau was left with his daughter Julia and immense grief. Painting became his escape and fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries who idealized peasants in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter, dreaming of the average class's hopes and dreams.\n\nRousseau's desire for art world acceptance is understandable in context. Uneducated in art, he started painting late and worked alongside other accomplished artists. Recognition came to him when Matisse was gaining traction. According to Jan Gordon in Modern French Painters, both artists were different: Matisse feared painting tritely, while Rousseau dreamed of a conventional picture that would gain him entry into the Artiste Français.",
            "Many a great thinker has suggested a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe this is because, at the core of it, there is a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats puts it in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMore to the point, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. For instance, a conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa may discuss foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not explain why it is good art. Typically, when asked about a favorite work of art or literature, we often hear, “There's just something about it” before a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals cannot be fully reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O’Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how well we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is always something intangible that is left unsaid. I believe the same is true for ethics. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\nI believe morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenal level, using a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, such as music, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Germany, as we know it today, is a robust and unified nation, a living tapestry of cultures that stretch from the majestic peaks of the Alps in München to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This unique cultural blend can be felt from the bustling streets of Köln on the Rhine, through the heart of Germany, all the way to the elegant city of Dresden, nestled along the Elbe. Given this diversity, it's no surprise that Germany's identity has been shaped by various sources and tribes.\n\nThe land of the Germans was once known as Germania. The origins of its name are hotly debated among scholars. Tacitus, a Roman historian, suggested the name came from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought against the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes who often crossed the Rhine for warfare. The exact origin is uncertain, with some proposing it could come from the German spear, known as a ger, or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating that the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nEarly Roman historian Tacitus wrote in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that he believed the Germans were aboriginal, having not mixed with other races through immigration or contact. He wondered, who would leave the fertile lands of Asia or Africa to settle in Germany, with its harsh climate, rugged landscape, and stern people? The Romans, for their part, did not initially settle in Germania. They sent expeditions to trade with the Germanic tribes and occasionally led military campaigns, but they mostly returned to their sprawling empire. As Germanic tribes began emerging in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills with the Romans, and even serving in their army.",
            "I was staring down, my mind completely blank, trying to take in the view in front of me. Unemotionally, I studied the object, but I couldn't relate it to any deeper understanding. My thoughts were flowing in and out of my mind, so rapidly that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own. I was just experiencing the view as it was.\n\nOnce, on the advice of an artist I worked with, I bought a drawing book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had always wanted to learn how to draw since I was six, and this book teaches everything from understanding the pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it teaches is to frame any picture you want to study in a square. This way, a complex picture, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, becomes simpler and more manageable.\n\nBut when I looked at the bowl of fruit in front of me, I couldn't mentally frame it. I was so overwhelmed and awestruck that I could only stare in wonderment. Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, and Renaissance masters used a rainbow of colors. If I had any artistic aspirations, then the bowl of fruit before me was the beginning of my art, the start of my story, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers touched the brush, my muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand moved through the air. I was giving shape and form to my thoughts, perhaps the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Flakes of matter broke away and disappeared. My hand hit the toilet handle again, my muscles tensing and jerking more anxiously the second time. The clogged brown package refused to budge, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.\n\nWith a mop in hand, I stood, feet apart, a green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat. I frowned, staring at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter left as a message for the cleaning crew at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more introspective moments, then my hand reached for the sheet of toilet paper, wrapping it like an oven mitt. Standing up, bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother preparing the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Another devastating reality we face is the alarming number of teenagers dying in car accidents. Multiple factors combine to create this deadly scenario for the youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health explain that the teen brain is not yet equipped to handle the dangers of driving, exacerbated by the lack of experience. This inexperience leads to more fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. Teens fare even worse when they're behind the wheel with their peers, and studies confirm that the presence of passengers increases the likelihood of accidents.\n\nTo address this problem, states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers. However, these measures are insufficient. The core issue is that, as a group, teens simply aren't ready to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes that even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. He found that teens under 19-20 often crave the thrill of risk-taking, which makes it sensible to delay driving until these tendencies stabilize. Continuing to award licenses to young teens will likely result in more deadly accidents and a steep rise in the death toll among teen drivers in the coming years, especially as the Baby-Boomer’s babies become eligible to drive by 2010.\n\nLegislation to tackle this issue could be simple yet effective. Driver's education classes could continue in schools to start the learning process, but no one under 18 should operate a motor vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued before granting a full driver's license, with a set number of practical training hours required. The number of hours could be based on current state requirements, like California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice. To protect teens across the nation, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be sensible and effective.\n\nThe proposed legislation is not a groundbreaking idea, but a practical step towards reducing the number of teen driving fatalities.",
            "So I decided to dive into the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, specifically the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen in total. I spent my time describing the poetic elements of most of these trick films and examining the unique characteristics of a few from the later years.\n\nMost trick films from the turn of the century were confined to a stage, composed within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement. They used long and medium shots, adhering to the rule of one shot equaling one film. However, some films at the beginning of the twentieth century dared to deviate from these guidelines by introducing elements like multiple shots.\n\nOne common trait among these trick films was their filming in an interior set within a frontal proscenium. The camera remained stationary, rooted in its position, not moving to follow figures or objects. This style was deeply rooted in theatre and vaudeville traditions. As a result, characters in these films mainly moved side-to-side, never walking towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally across the frame, but the camera never tracks them.\n\nThis proscenium style also leads to long and medium shots being the norm, with close-ups being almost non-existent. This aligns with theatre and vaudeville practices, where audiences would see the entire performance at once, framed by the stage's borders. Characters, therefore, generally stayed in the middle ground and did not move towards the camera, making close-ups uncommon.\n\nMost early trick films followed the pattern of one conceptual shot per film. This constraint limited the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limited their dramatic or narrative potential; most focused on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts, with little story. However, it’s important to note that in these films, a single conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes might not equate to a single physical shot. A single “shot” could actually be several joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) as an example. Upon close inspection, you can see the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, was a staunch and early proponent of Republicanism. Agriculture, his primary profession, and his short stint in politics made him a formidable advocate for personal liberty and government transparency. His commitment to agrarianism was the cornerstone of his views on governance, impacting his stances on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and even the judicial system.",
            "Well, let me take a look back at Figure 17, and there it is, a steep decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. That was certainly a bit of a letdown, and it's tough to pinpoint exactly why it happened. I mean, we're in New England, so it's natural that with the onset of winter, folks just aren't as inclined to commute by bicycle or on foot. Then there's the end of the fall semester, where everyone's heads are down, focusing on wrapping up schoolwork and grades. And let's not forget, December is filled with holiday cheer, which means many don't even need to come campus for weeks. Classes pick back up for the spring semester in late January, adding to the drop. But that doesn't explain February's low numbers. It's like any new project, we had a boost at the start, but then it's natural to see a decline. So, to give things a kick, we rolled out the Carpool Challenge Week in March, and that brought back the log submissions. But it's a challenge to keep that momentum going, especially when you've got holiday breaks and semester slowdowns. Then there's the fact that people are just so used to driving their cars. It's a big part of our culture. So, we had to find ways to incentivize alternative commuting. We gave out a bunch of gift certificates to local shops and services. It would've been interesting to see how bigger prizes like a bicycle or hybrid car would've boosted engagement. We stuck with the gift cards initially, but maybe if we'd announced a few bicycles in December and then a hybrid car in January, we'd have seen more participation.",
            "So, you know what an ETF is? It's like a security that follows an index, commodity, or a bunch of assets, but trades like a stock on an exchange. It gives you the good stuff of an index fund with the perks of owning individual stocks, like selling short, buying on margin, and buying just a single share. Sounds great, right? Well, there's the downside—you have to pay a commission for every trade, just like you would with stocks.\n\nNow, let's talk about another awesome thing about ETFs—they come in so many flavors! But here's a heads up, you gotta be smart and evaluate if these benefits really exist and how much they do. For this, we're looking at the ETF IHF and its top ten holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Let's take a peek at those top ten holdings and their percentages.\n\nTo see how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF, we'll calculate their contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, using the current percentage of assets. Here's the chart:\n\nFrom the chart, it's clear that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could give you a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, and a Beta 0.12 lower. It seems like a portfolio of just these top 10 could be a better deal.\n\nBut wait, before we get too excited, we gotta check if these two portfolios are actually different. To do this, we'll look at the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, and see how it compares to the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's most highly regarded works is \"Dream-Land.\" Within this poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" which Mabbott traces back to the Roman poet Virgil. Virgil used this term in reference to an island north of Britain, the edge of the known world in Greek times. While Virgil's use of the term is undeniable, there's a more contemporary source that's often overlooked. Poe was deeply interested in German literature.\n\nThis point is crucial because it indicates Poe's familiarity with the works of Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws comparisons between Poe's and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe had imitated Goethe's style.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe's death, 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king who, after his wife's death, becomes a heavy drinker and eventually decides to end his own life. The similarities between the King of Thule and the description in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, perhaps a dark reflection of Poe's own experiences with loss and alcohol. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just one year before Poe's use of the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references \"ultra Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but he employs the term \"Thule\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" bookending the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a dark and lonely landscape, haunted by the memory of dead friends and a world devoid of color, mirroring the state of the King of Thule after his wife's death. The poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into one of Goethe's creations.\n\nGoethe was a significant author who Poe would have been familiar with, not only because of his respect for Tennyson but also due to the many reproductions of Goethe's works that were circulating at the time.",
            "So, let me give you the lowdown on a legal scenario. Under California law, could a customer who got hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages? This hypothetical customer, let's call them Jennifer Palmer, argues that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with malice because he was informed about the spill twice but chose to ignore it, delaying cleanup until he finished his dinner. Palmer could point to previous incidents where D&D customers had slipped and fallen, even though Martin was aware of the risk. The judge is unlikely to dismiss this claim outright because the evidence shows that Martin's actions were likely to cause harm and were intentional. However, the argument that his actions were despicable might be less convincing, given that there had been several slip-and-fall incidents in 2009, but still, Martin didn’t take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of his store. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee named Rich Wayne informed Martin about the apple spill, but Martin was on his dinner break and didn't want to deal with customer complaints. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill at 5:15 pm, but again, no action was taken. By 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell, suffering a serious back injury. D&D is now being sued for damages, and we are considering filing a motion to partially dismiss the punitive damage claim. In California, punitive damages can be awarded for conduct involving oppression, fraud, or malice. The law defines malice as conduct that intends to cause harm or, if there's no intent, conduct that's despicable and committed with a willful disregard for others' safety. The court has characterized conduct as malicious if the defendant was aware of the dangerous consequences and deliberately failed to avoid them. So, could Palmer's case be successful? Well, it's complicated, but it's definitely not a slam dunk.",
            "Just about four years back, I took a course on Islam at CBC. One of the main topics that sparked heated debates in class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion. I believe that this question is perhaps even more pertinent today than it was then. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I've witnessed a shift in the American media's portrayal of Islam, from a hostile view of extremists to an extreme form of tolerance. It's hard to imagine that in 2001, we could have ever seen a presidential candidate like Barak Obama, who has a Muslim background in his family, leading the conversation.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is quite fascinating. Based on what I know of his history, there seems to be a discrepancy between his biography and the personality I've come to understand. Before this course, I was under the impression that Muhammad forced converts to Islam. He would conquer tribes and force them to adopt the religion. However, the biography portrays him as a sort of martyr, misunderstood and even humble, who attracted people to his teachings without needing to compel them.\n\nMoreover, there are uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. For instance, when Muhammad multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men, it's a style of writing that makes me believe the authors wanted Muhammad to be seen as the humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything but simply lived in truth and miracles. This approach, to me, is problematic because it downplays the life and miracles of Jesus Christ. It's as if they're trying to steal and take credit for Jesus' life and personhood through Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, there are many stories in the biography that seem to serve as proof of 'witness' or how people 'naturally' converted to Islam. However, many of these stories are told from the perspective of third parties. The author illustrates that they heard it from someone who heard it from someone else, and so on. I found this approach less convincing because, although it aimed to authenticate the stories, it made them seem more dubious.\n\nWhat bothers me the most about this work is how it tries to elevate Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, historical accounts contradict this notion of Muhammad being a gentle and humble man. I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his beliefs during his lifetime were quickly abandoned in the development of Christian thought that came after his life. If we look at this history with a broad perspective, we see a trend of Christianity moving further and further away from its origin. Today's world shows a growing awareness and unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people might resist new ideas, they may not be influential enough to change the whole. Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow in future years. There will be a desire to differentiate between the doctrines added to Christianity over time from Jesus' original intent. This reversal in Christian history will take decades or even centuries, but it is inevitable. A movement will grow that will peel away layers of doctrine, one after another, as if the clock were moving backward, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity remains. When this trend spreads through the United States and Europe, influencing masses to worship as if they were living during Jesus' time, following only his ideas, the church will remain strong to lead the way. However, as the theological clock moves backward, the extreme diversity in Christendom will reverse into more uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of all kinds, we will see increasing similarities instead of differences. History is filled with great reversions. For example, Christians were once persecuted and killed by the Roman Empire, but later, the empire became a Christian institution. Our country has moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play out in the Christian religion, undoing history to find its source and undoing diversity in the process. This process will be made possible by a method of reading Jesus' words as metaphorical, not as literal statements. What happened since Jesus' lifetime? If we look far back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning of Christianity. Monotheism, the belief in a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were at the core by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not united, dividing into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I firmly believe that The Jungle demonstrates the intrinsic greed and self-centeredness of humans. At our core, we are driven to make our lives as comfortable and successful as possible, without much thought for those beneath us. This is evident in the behavior of the factory owners and managers, who prioritize their corporate interests above all else. They will stop at nothing to expand their empires, regardless of the harm caused to people or the environment. As Upton Sinclair describes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery illustrates the stark disregard these industrialists have for the pollution and suffering around them, including the animal waste and toxic fumes that poison the air and soil.\n\nThe factory owners also displayed no concern for their workers' well-being. They exploited them harshly, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They forced workers to labor long hours and abruptly fired them en masse for any reason, leaving them jobless and without compensation. During the time The Jungle is set, there were few legal protections for workers, allowing the owners to operate with impunity. Employees were expected to endure the terrible conditions and accept the constant threat of job loss, with no recourse or aid.\n\nThe lack of unions or support organizations in Packingtown further exacerbated the plight of the workers. While some unions were formed, they often proved more exploitative than helpful, lining their own pockets from the workers' misfortune. This system of exploitation and oppression reduced workers to a state of near-slavery, with their lives and opportunities entirely at the mercy of the factory owners, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many writers employ various methods to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers regarding significant subjects. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs adjectives and nouns in unusual ways to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. Other times, he ascribes symbolic significance to colors, which he later uses to convey feelings about certain objects. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald imbues colors like white/gray and red/pink with meaning and uses these meanings to evoke feelings about important subjects.\n\nFitzgerald's association of white/gray with uniformity is particularly notable. He establishes this meaning early in the novel by frequently using these colors. Daisy and Jordan are often described as \"in white\" (8), and nearly everyone at Gatsby's party wears white, including Nick in \"white flannels\" (41), Tom in a \"white shirt\" (36), and Catherine as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exceptions are when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where he notices \"gaudy primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald also uses white/gray to describe common or unremarkable subjects, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray old man\" (27) selling dogs. After building up these associations, Fitzgerald employs white/gray to signify uniformity or insignificance. This technique begins with Daisy, whom he describes as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster,\" making her seem less like a character and more like a uniform object Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald employs this approach with Daisy repeatedly, further emphasizing her uniformity, as seen in her \"gray haze\" and later in a white dress (115) before her encounter with Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County's mild, sunny climate makes it a powerhouse in agriculture. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers flourish here. There's a thriving demand for organic, community-supported agriculture in the area, with many local organizations boasting long waiting lists for produce. Organic eggs and milk are also popular among locals. Many organic farms offer tours and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching, generating additional income and educational opportunities.\n\nOrganic farming, while offering greater biodiversity and habitat improvement, comes with higher costs. It demands more intensive labor and management to control pests and weeds without chemicals. Losses can be higher, and small farms lack the economies of scale of larger operations. Non-organic practices beneficial to wildlife, like planting cover crops, strategic grazing, and invasive species removal, also come at a labor cost. Therefore, a landowner in this situation might seek financial assistance or expertise to optimize profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe chosen property is a 160-acre parcel in Potrero, San Diego County, California, featuring chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland near the Cleveland National Forest. It's part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion under the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which lists over a hundred species, many of them endangered or declining, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, certain butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nNative Americans inhabited this land for centuries, followed by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This land was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production. I chose this property from a real estate website, researching available government programs to help a small farmer mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. An organic farm in the same area serves as a model for what this land could achieve.",
            "Culture plays a big role in any negotiation. It's not just about what culture is, but also what it isn't and what it stands for. Culture isn't uniform and isn't just national or international; it varies from place to place. Sayings like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are too broad. A better approach is to understand how a culture's attitude can affect negotiations. When meeting a foreign culture, you naturally compare it to your own, which is natural. To understand a culture, you might look at its history or its prejudices. Don't judge or try to change it; instead, work within its boundaries, especially if you're at a weaker bargaining position. If you're in a foreign environment, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome barriers. It's also important to remember that a culture isn't just national—many companies within a nation have their own corporate culture, which can affect dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. For example, some companies encourage philanthropy while others restrict it. Even in American culture, corporate attitudes vary widely. Some cultures may appear more uniform but are still worth digging deeper into. Values are crucial too, as they explain why a culture is the way it is. If saving face is important in a culture, you won't publicly shame your company or superior to win a negotiation. A hard-driven bargain might be more important in another culture, so not settling early is key. Understanding these cultural nuances before negotiations begins is important, but also learning about your opponent personally can make negotiations more effective.",
            "Okay, so here's a familiar quote, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’\" This is from Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and it's the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. This idea is also shared by another author, Thomas Aquinas. Since we're comparing their arguments, we'll assume both are right about the existence of a god, particularly the one from the Bible. Otherwise, comparing their arguments wouldn't make sense. Now, while they both have valid points, neither really provides a complete reason to believe in this God.\n\nLet's start with St. Anselm's basic argument. He suggests that you can find proof of God's existence within your own mind. It's all about understanding through faith. He says that since God is within our understanding, we can't doubt his existence. This is a bit wordy, but essentially, he's saying that God is proven by what we already know within our own minds. No outside evidence needed, that's what faith is all about.\n\nNow, Thomas Aquinas takes a different approach. He believes you can prove God's existence through reason and empirical evidence, no faith required. This would be great for bringing in new converts, as they could be convinced by logic alone. He presents five different logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument shows that God's existence is a logical necessity. It's like saying, if you know you're missing one piece of a puzzle, you can figure out what it looks like without actually seeing it.\n\nSo, in short, both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas bring up good points, but neither provides a solid, complete reason to believe in God.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince known as Siddhartha Gautama was born. He later became Buddha and his teachings gave birth to Buddhism, with the most traditional branch being Theravada. The religion has been around for nearly 2500 years, growing and changing over time. You can see this evolution in places like Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. While Buddha didn't teach about such a ceremony, monks and laypeople still participate, illustrating how the religion has evolved. This evolution isn't limited to superficial practices but also extends to its core beliefs. The Theravada community has had to adapt their doctrines, influenced by both internal and external factors, both hostile and benign.\n\nThroughout this discussion, I'll use several key terms. Internal forces refer to those from within the Buddhist community, regardless of whether they are monks or laypeople. External forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm or damage Buddhism, driven by a negative perception. Benign forces, on the other hand, don't necessarily wish to support or harm the Buddhist community but might do so incidentally.\n\nBefore diving in, let's understand Theravada Buddhism's core principles. Buddhists take refuge in the Triple Gem—the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka sets out rules for life, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts is key to escaping Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and overcoming lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides rules for laypeople and monks. Laypeople follow five precepts, while monks have many more rules to abide by. The most fundamental belief in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: life is Dukkha (suffering), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and there is a path to enlightenment.",
            "The United States and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the U.S. defeated Mexico and gained Texas and the American Southwest. There were other disputes between the two nations, which persisted until the First World War. The rivalry originated from disagreements on religion, culture, and tradition, as well as differing material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis is similar to how many other nations have enduring rivalries with their neighbors, often driven by shared borders and conflicting interests. The U.S. and Mexico are not unique in this regard, with David M. Pletcher (1977) noting that only Mexico and Cuba have had long-lasting overarching American diplomatic issues (p. 41). These nations are geographically close to the U.S. and have historically been rivals, unlike most other Latin American countries which have maintained good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences have often been a source of tension between nations, a trend seen throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) highlights that in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy (p.86), much like the Cold War rivalry between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which was partly ideological and partly a competition over vital interests. However, in this case, the ideological strife was rooted in religious preferences rather than political structures. This mistrust stemmed from the historical enmity between the English and Spanish, which made establishing friendly foreign relations difficult.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes were territorial issues, involving border raids and frontier problems. Bandit and outlaw attacks from American border towns were a significant issue until both nations employed military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nThe rivalry began to fade as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the U.S., and finally ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico later in the 19th century (Schmitt 1974, p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly struck down by an illness I had never known existed. I was a nurse, having chosen this profession out of a deep longing for the safety and security I hadn't experienced as a child. The mantra \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick\" echoed through my adolescence and beyond. Despite dreaming of a career in science or journalism, I opted for nursing. Yet, here I am: 46 years old, single, with no financial stability and unable to work. My disability persists, and after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability, I have little left to call my own. Each day is a struggle, a relentless assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, but one thing is clear: I couldn't have endured for all these years without the support of my family and a few trusted friends. And let me tell you, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nThe lesson here is that life is filled with emergencies, both big and small. No amount of preparation can guarantee that you'll overcome everything on your own. I wholeheartedly agree that we should cease relying solely on big government. I'd much rather see Americans learn to trust one another again, to help each other and to ask for help, rather than each of us retreating to our backyards to build fallout shelters.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often talk about \"rugged individualism\" as the force that built this country. But the truth is, our forefathers didn't cross the Rockies in wagon trains alone. It was compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that saw them through hard times.\n\nSo, do prepare. I have supplies: a disaster kit with first aid, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape, flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm, and the ability to can or preserve food, do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment. But while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms change over time? Are there any limitations or rules that dictate how they evolve? While in 1917 D'Arcy Thompson noted that “Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,” the same can be said today. Modern mathematical modeling has been applied to study mollusk skeletogenesis through both development and evolution, as seen in works by Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our research explores how combining mathematical modeling and experimental studies can help understand the mechanisms driving evolutionary and developmental change in Prunum. We analyzed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative traits, which were entered into the software program CerioShell. By creating hypothetical shell morphologies, we aimed to interpret the limits of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events within this group.\n\nImagine a shell as a structure that spirals through 360 degrees of space over time, forming a coiled structure called a whorl. These whorls turn around an imaginary central column, known as the columella, which runs through the shell's center. The rate at which whorls grow can vary, and the line separating each whorl is called a suture. Most shells have the largest whorl as the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire includes all whorls except the last, with the apex at the top and the base at the bottom. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles: apical (top), basal (bottom), apertural (front), and abapertural (back). The usual orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical side and identify where the first suture starts. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts and count whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. This movement can be traced using coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture along with horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, parameters can be varied to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Another month has come and gone, and despite the lack of significant changes in my life, a few notable events have transpired. Indonesia's progress on reducing neonatal and infant mortality over the past decade has been lackluster, despite making strides towards meeting some Millennium Development Goals. Specifically, the target goals for child and maternal health are far from being met by the 2015 deadline. Several factors contribute to this, suggesting that the overall health system needs bolstering rather than just programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen improvements in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% meeting this criterion. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions in complicated pregnancies, leading to a high number of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. This improvement is somewhat misleading, and there's still much work to be done. Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional, and the data on postnatal care is incomplete, indicating a concerning trend.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain below the expected level, at about 4%. Urban areas have a c-section rate of 7%, compared to just 2% in rural settings. This highlights the issue of healthcare equity, as services are primarily concentrated in urban areas. There's also a stark difference in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, with a 27% gap, pointing to difficulties for the poor in accessing healthcare services due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering how to tackle the lack of service in improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is whether Indonesia should focus on program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system. While programmatic approaches offer targeted and manageable objectives and faster results, they can lead to funding imbalances, resource allocation issues, and duplication of services. The challenge lies in determining the most effective path forward.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous detail and fixation on the aristocracy of the era. Notably, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights deviate from this norm, incorporating mystery and eccentricity to enrich the characters and their motivations.  The two novels often employ dreamlike elements to convey a sense of unease and confusion, which helps to deepen the reader's understanding of the characters' emotions and inner turmoil.\n\n\"Suddenly, a cacophony of bewildering and disorientating ideas flooded his mind. He seemed to be walking with Sikes and Crackit, who were engaged in a heated argument. Their voices echoed in his ears, as if they were happening right then. Abruptly, he realized he was speaking to them. Then, a report of gunfire echoed through the air, and a rush of lights and shouts filled his vision. He was being swiftly carried away by an unseen force. Through this flurry of images, a constant, gnawing awareness of pain lingered, tormenting him.\n\nHis experience with the shooting, revisited in Chapter 28, was revisited in a vivid dream-like state as he struggled to seek help. This passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events and the desperate state of his health, evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself numbed all his senses, and he did not even notice the 'unseen hand' that bore him away. The pain was now a constant, linked with fear rather than surprise. This experience raises questions about whose will brought about his misfortune, as it certainly wasn't his own. This shooting highlights Oliver's lack of control over his life, as he couldn't even attempt to influence the outcome, even as his life was in jeopardy, a growing sense of defeat is implied, suggesting that Old Fagin had begun to break his spirit, forcing him to accept despair and limiting his ability to react. Had Oliver not been in such a state, he might have made some effort to save himself.\n\n'The day passed – a day? It was gone before it came, and night returned, long and silent, yet fleeting in its duration. The night was a long, dreadful silence, yet short in its passing.'\"",
            "A couple of years ago, I worked at an after-school program tutoring elementary students. I did my best to assist them with their subjects, but my strengths were in English and reading. I was asked by one of the instructors to help a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. He seemed to have peculiar reading issues. He could pronounce some letters perfectly while others were way off. I realized something was wrong; he was of Latino descent, yet he spoke perfect English. We struggled until I met his mother. She spoke only Spanish. With my limited Spanish skills, we communicated, and that's when it hit me: Adrian could read but didn't know the English alphabet well. I'm not sure if this revelation helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the challenges of the language barrier in schools, especially in California. Even if a child speaks perfect English, reading it can still be difficult. This problem is evident, and so what do we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was straightforward: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There is no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—no single solution will fix this problem. The key is to combine all these approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a fantastic idea. It's beneficial not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all kids. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" Many fears surround this idea, that it's a waste of resources and that most children won't benefit. But this isn't true. If we implemented these programs more widely, all children would reap the benefits. How do we do this? Should all teachers be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic. However, there's no reason we can't have bilingual aides or tutors to support these programs.",
            "Just as we grow up, many of us are told from a young age that there is something greater than ourselves, something beyond our comprehension. Some of us are introduced to this concept through Sunday school, others through Temple, or we explore it within ourselves. Some readily accept the beliefs passed down by our parents, while others reject them entirely, denying the existence of anything beyond our personal experiences. Our journey to define part of ourselves often involves spiritual exploration, searching for a guiding light to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun. “A cardinal,” my father replied when I asked him about his favorite bird. We sat on the front porch, listening to the rain pour down, while we smoked our cigarettes. He looked out into the rain, as if looking back in time. He had become frail, his clothes loose on his body, and his hair sparse. He gazed into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him, as it would only make it more real. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall on the June twilight. My father passed away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. Chemotherapy and radiation did not ease his suffering but prolonged it a few months. I could not watch him pass away, as I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news. No one called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel,\" as described by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, is essentially a blend of \"Old-New,\" much like an oxymoron. The Gothic genre has been both criticized and celebrated, often accused of lacking depth and praised for its \"terrible sublime\" atmosphere (Burke). The original Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, merged the elements of both ancient and modern romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new form of literary expression. Walpole incorporated old theatrical elements and the mimicry of nature in modern novels to present a \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often references medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various cultures, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to modern societal and literary advancements. The fusion of traditional Gothic elements and the new format of the novel, allowing readers a more personal view of characters' psychology, is what has kept the Gothic genre relevant for so long, making it both obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from the original era.\n\nA key concept in Gothic novels is the idea of Chivalry. The medieval concept of knightly training and the chivalric ideal, both retained and transformed in The Castle of Otranto, are central to Gothic literature. Chivalry was important to Gothic writers because it represented the classic knight—brave, honorable, and competent—contrasted with their perceived lack of these qualities in contemporary society. By using chivalric themes and manners, the Gothic past is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the evolution of Gothic to Romanticism and serving as a means to improve the present. Walpole, writing during a politically tumultuous time, may have felt that the supposed morality and inherent goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in society. This is evident in his characters, like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits. Before meeting Frederic, he is described as:",
            "Supply chain management is the sequence of processes moving goods from the order point to the final delivery to the customer. The term was coined by Keith Oliver, a consultant, in 1982. He described it as the planning, implementation, and control of everything that occurs within the supply chain to satisfy customer needs quickly and efficiently. Six key elements make up a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these elements to deliver top-notch customer service.\n\nFirst among these elements is production, the backbone of the supply chain. This stage lays out when, where, how, and why products will be produced. Managers must understand what customers want, which they can determine by examining the market. Once they analyze the market and grasp customer demand, they can decide which products to produce and in what quantities. After setting production targets and choosing the best facilities, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Every detail is crucial in production, as improper planning can lead to significant time and money losses. For instance, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business had a designated process, from employee uniform design to receiving shipments. Clear, outlined processes ensure smooth operations without confusion or mismatches in expectations.\n\nThe second key element is supply, which involves strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with unique equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division best suits each part of the product process. They may also choose to outsource work to other companies to achieve velocity – the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while keeping costs low.",
            "Just today, I saw a peculiar sign in the street. It read, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, the star of Juno, stood alone on the corner, holding a piece of cardboard with this ominous message. Burma, or Myanmar as it's also known, is a Southeast Asian country that's been under the iron grip of a tyrannical military junta since 1962, when they seized power through a coup d'état. In 2007, street protests erupted, led by Burmese monks, marking the first public demonstrations in a decade. These protests, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution,\" initially saw peaceful gatherings but soon escalated into violent clashes between the monks and the military junta, with monasteries being ransacked and foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai, being imprisoned or even killed, like on September 27th, 2007. The official death toll stands at 13, but a defected colonel from the army suggests the real number could be in the thousands.\n\nThis isn't an isolated incident. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, and even our current president, George W. Bush, is said to consult with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a branch of the Republican Party. Notable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, workers, and students were killed in the hundreds to thousands. There was also the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups and the government systematically murdered Tutsis and political moderates, irrespective of ethnicity. And who can forget Hitler's Third Reich, where Jews were systematically rounded up and killed across several countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is largely due to his endurance and his ability to mold his orchestra. His piano presence is often subtle in his compositions, but as a composer, Ellington excelled at creating intricate and deep pieces that highlighted the individual skills of his band members. Ellington crafted a framework where soloists could freely improvise and wrote tightly arranged pieces and phrases that showcased the unique style of each band member, emphasizing the overall tone of the orchestra to create consistent and original sounds for each piece. His mastery of individual players' sounds and how they complemented each other in a growing ensemble allowed him to write some of jazz history's most innovative and brilliant works. The Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington’s use of voice as an instrument, with Creole Love Call being an early example of this. This piece uses voice to add texture and color without lyrics, and also showcases Ellington's ability to complement his soloists, a trait evident throughout his career. Creole Love Call features six choruses, each with distinct elements such as voice and reed call and response, muted trumpet solos, and full band echoes. Ellington's use of voice to add tone color is just one of his stylistic traits that permeate his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines tight orchestration with an ear for tone color. He uses a call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, with Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton playing a key role in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Another day had passed, and I'd been feeling that persistent itch again, that gnawing need for something, anything. This sensation had been a constant companion since I hit puberty, now three years strong. It started as a desire for things, but had morphed into a craving for someone. Yet, the right someone had eluded me. Boys had shown interest, but none had sparked anything within me. I'd spent years puzzling over this peculiar predicament, but it was a mystery that remained unsolved. So, I carried on with life, my mind a whirlwind of questions and curiosity.\n\nA typical day at home was usually a peaceful symphony, with my parents as the calm conductors. They never raised their voices, and their daughter was a rare fly in the ointment. Arguments were few and far between, except for my insistence on asserting my independence. I was a likeable, nice girl, but my spirited personality was a stark contrast to my parents' calm demeanor.\n\nToday, however, was far from that usual serenity. As I wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration for my own soul, a shriek from the kitchen pierced the air. My mother's voice echoed through the house, and I rushed to the kitchen, heart pounding. \"Mom? Mom, what's wrong?!\" I shouted, panic rising. My mother lay on the floor, groaning and clutching her side. \"Ow... sweetie... I... need you to take me to the hospital,\" she managed to say, her words rushed and pained. I quickly gathered her, cradling her in my arms, and carried her to the car. That morning's leisurely walk transformed into a mad dash to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital's sterile scent filled my nostrils, but my mind was too focused on helping my mother. I rushed her to the triage, calling for assistance. A flurry of medical personnel surrounded us, taking her away to be evaluated. I was left to wait, worry gnawing at me.\n\nMom had fallen from a stepladder while trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet in the house.",
            "Another study has revealed that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), shown by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed), is linked to a lower risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as reduced stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a tweaked version of the Med diet, with more plants like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, more monounsaturated fats compared to saturated ones, and less animal products and saturated fats. Drinking alcohol in moderation is also part of the diet.\n\nPrevious research has indicated that following the Med diet lowers the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality and is better than a low-fat diet for weight loss and lowering cholesterol levels in those who are overweight. However, previous studies didn’t focus on the risk of stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study observed over 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, with no prior history of heart disease or diabetes, from the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort of nurses in 11 US states. Six times, over 20 years from 1984 to 2004, they calculated an aMed diet score based on food intake reported by the nurses. Over 95% of the nurses participated throughout the study. To ensure reliability, the reported data and health outcomes were verified by medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Body mass index (BMI), smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were also tracked, and starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo account for variations in individual food intake, an average aMed score from the repeated food frequency questionnaires was calculated. Adjustments were made for factors that could affect the results, such as age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing the Cox proportional-hazard model, the study examined the relationship between the aMed diet score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal cases.\n\nThe research found that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, there were 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the top aMed group had a lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest group (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America was struck by a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market tanked, and some of the country’s most significant corporations were left in shambles. This recession continues to this day, so let's delve into how this happened and how we can prevent it from recurring. In essence, the financial crisis was the result of self-serving and naive political choices that compelled banks and firms to issue sub-prime loans, further stressing an already fragile and insufficient financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to back and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks found themselves short on capital reserves, passing the chaos to the repacked mortgages they had sold, and onward to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to the Clinton era in 1999. The President was in the midst of a reelection bid, aiming to bolster his popularity by relaxing lending restrictions. This move laid the groundwork for the sub-prime crisis that would unfold seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999 that, “Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest mortgage underwriter, was under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals and faced pressure from shareholders to maintain its remarkable profit growth.” Holmes accurately predicted the repercussions of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation could face trouble in a downturn, necessitating a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As mentioned in the introduction and foreseen by Holmes, ill-advised lending would indeed plunge the economy into crisis.\n\nSeveral factors combined to send the economy spiraling, one of which was the intricate structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, further intertwining different sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets becoming overly leveraged in the housing market, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had purchased mortgage-backed securities in financial misery. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt by 2007, which represented about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to become commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",

Dr. Merlin's been known to shout at her screen when she finds herself stuck in \"Too Much Information,\" not in a good way.\n\nMy gentle readers know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages where nothing happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is the little devil on your shoulder saying, \"Get the history out of the way to get to the good parts,\" not to be confused with the other devil urging you to tell your audience every single detail of your characters' pasts.\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.

In fiction, it's you doing the telling.\n\nAn example: As you read, you're told the heroine met her beloved, they married, and he died in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this to take two pages with minimal dialogue. You'd expect the author to show the husband's character through words and actions, to feel his love for her. You'd expect to see their bond grow, to understand her thoughts and dreams through his eyes, and so mourn his death with her, growing closer to her.\n\nIn short, you'd expect more substance to the story's skeleton: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that substance.

            "I caught two news segments from Columbus, Ohio today, August 13, 2011. The first was a live broadcast from NBC 4. The main story was about a bloke named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. Not much about her, but they showed his mug shot and he looked like he was straight out of a bad horror movie. They only gave it about two minutes, which seemed about right given it was still an unfolding story. The second story was about some kid named Travis Buyers, 18, who got shot in the Sharon Woods area and was in critical condition. They didn't have any arrests yet and the SWAT team was on the case. This story was a bit short, which might have been because it was a \"black\" man or a black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that minorities get less coverage when they're victims of a crime. If it's a white child or adult, the media goes nuts, but minorities are lucky if they even get a mention. The next story was about finding a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. They said it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the chopper. Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. The storm updates were next; they said Saturday's afternoon would have rain and thunderstorms, with temperatures in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. They kept it brief but it was a teaser to keep you watching. They also had a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. A dark-skinned black man robbed the store, they emphasized his blackness and how dark he was. Another guy named Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin, was sentenced for conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts from Texas to Ohio. They strangely used \"300 months\" instead of \"25 years\" in prison. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, but I don't think that was relevant to the story.",
            "The bond between brothers is something special; a tie that cannot be easily broken. This bond is a canvas for many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers have a unique understanding of each other, a connection that goes deeper than any other relationship. This bond is most visible in times of crisis, where the true nature of their feelings for one another becomes clear, whether it is for good or for ill. The consequences of these emotions are significant, and understanding them is key to navigating this complex relationship. When one brother looks into the eyes of another, they see not just their sibling but a reflection of themselves. Their actions and the results of their actions reveal their true character. This theme is beautifully depicted in \"The Scarlet Ibis\", where two brothers embark on an ill-fated journey through a lush, vividly described landscape. The story is told through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex feelings and his view of the world. These feelings heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, tragic journey, the protagonist feels a sense of resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother who could share his worldly skills, like holding breath underwater, running, jumping, or climbing trees. He wanted a brother who could join him in adventures like running to Horsehead Landing or perching in the tall pine tree behind the barn. However, Doodle's condition—an extremely weak heart—made these dreams unachievable. The protagonist's dreams were shattered, and he felt anger towards the child. He even considered smothering Doodle with a pillow to end his life. What kind of child would have such thoughts? However, his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him. This simple act of love gave him hope, showing that his conviction to harm Doodle was not strong. In the back of his mind, he still loved his brother, despite his resentment.",
            "The human brain is a complex, innovative information processing system. Over the ages, as technology evolved from primitive to modern, so did the metaphors used to understand the brain. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and more recently, a computer. As you explore the brain, keep in mind that these metaphors, while useful, can also lead to misconceptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs, which convert physical sensations like touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. These signals are transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when you see a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing integrates simple information like color and orientation to identify it as a box. Top-down processing then supports this recognition, helping you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole.\n\nOnce information is processed, an attention filter determines its importance and directs it to the relevant cognitive processes. For example, your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, but a healthy attention filter discards these details, allowing you to focus on your name even in a noisy room. This filtering happens at various stages.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first be stored. Memory exists in different forms: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded based on its type, such as structurally for visual stimuli or phonemically for auditory ones. Verbal input can be encoded semantically, referring to its meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Working memory, which holds data for about 20 seconds, is maintained by electrical signals looping through neurons. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained by structural changes in specific proteins.\n\nThere are various models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, influenced by human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model suggests that concepts (nodes) are connected based on their relatedness. For example, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley, in his novel Brave New World, takes aim at the encroaching threat of technology and the capitalist structure that reinforces it, painting a grim picture of a dystopian future. In this world, people prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned since birth to seek instant happiness above all else. The citizens are mere pawns in a larger game, confined to a single ideology imposed by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, Huxley's suspicions about the faults in the emerging economic system become evident. Terms like homogeny and reification highlight the societal conditioning that mirrors the faults of the capitalist system he sees around him.\n\nCapitalism is mocked through the concept of false consciousness, where the common people are kept unaware of their true economic relations, focusing solely on personal gain. This control is evident in the conditioning of Brave New World's citizens, who are driven to consume, spend, and indulge. This is manipulated by the World Controller, a form of hegemony where lower classes are unaware of their oppression, while upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, mostly accept their designated roles. The interactions between different classes are significant indicators of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nBrave New World presents a society where individual relationships are superficial and lack depth. Characters are indistinguishable from one another, suggesting that technology and capitalism strip people of their free will and expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent; interactions are kept shallow, with men focusing on women's physical attributes and women discussing their encounters without shame. This complacency with one's social status is a reflection of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are convinced of their superiority as long as they consume and conform to societal norms.",
            "So another semester has gone by, and here I am, still trudging along at University Park. It's been two and a half years since I started here, or four and a half semesters. Navigating this campus can be a real pain, especially when you're stuck in the farthest reaches, like East Halls. Back in my freshman year, I was all the way east, practically at the edge of the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. A 25-minute walk to classes in the Willard building, especially in bad weather, was a real chore. I found out from an alum that not too long ago, East Halls was separated from the rest of the campus by vast empty fields. Now that space is filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments, and campus expansion is making it even harder to get around. So, what's the solution? Bikes, of course! But they're only useful if students use them, and the campus needs to be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nI was chatting with a friend who recently picked up cycling after a few years off. He said, “Bikes are great, for a few years it wasn't cool to ride, but it's the most efficient way to get around.” Plus, they're good for your body. Just a bowl of oatmeal and a little effort can take you 30 miles or more. I live off campus now, as far from the center as some dorms. The smartest move I've made this year was buying a bike. Classes at Thomas building take 25 minutes to walk, but on a bike, it cuts that down to 5 minutes if you pedal hard. The only downside is Pollock Road, the straightest route from my house to Thomas, isn't always the easiest to ride. Still, I'd rather bike than walk, as it saves me an extra 30-40 minutes every day, which adds up to over two and a half hours a week. If I didn't have a bike, walking would be my only option, and that's just not feasible with my busy schedule."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "So, I'm all set to dive into an education in social work. My dream is to work with the Division of Family and Children Services, helping kids who have been abused or neglected, and providing support for troubled families. I've got some core values that I think I can bring to the social work field: service, respect, ethical nature, and a commitment to improving relationships between people, as well as my own professional growth. These values aren't just for the job; they're deeply personal to me too.\n\nI've always had a heart for helping others, but I wasn't sure what career path to take. Throughout high school and college, I saw many people shying away from their problems and using coping mechanisms that weren't ideal. These experiences led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break from my studies. One summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy nervously sitting on her couch. Turns out, he was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parents’ house. I offered to help, driving over to the house to talk to the police. They asked me to talk to the parents, as there was nothing they could do legally for the teenager. The parents seemed nervous and blamed their son for involving outsiders to resolve simple disputes. After this, I started seriously considering a career in social work to help kids with family conflicts.\n\nAnother key value in social work is social justice. Our society claims to value the individual, but often we follow archaic traditions rather than truly embracing uniqueness. If we mourn lost individuals, why strive to be like everyone else? I am an individual and I don't want to limit myself based on what others are doing. Throughout my years in high school and college, I stood up against social injustice in many ways: unnatural hair colors, unique clothing choices, ear piercings, involvement with GSBA, fighting against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will continue to protest injustices I see.",
            "So here's a quick rundown of what the paper's all about. It's a deep dive into Biological and Sociocultural models and their take on insomnia. The Biological model zeros in on the genetic and health aspects, like how genes and medical conditions can mess with sleep. Meanwhile, the Sociocultural model looks at environmental factors, including race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review takes a closer look at insomnia through these lenses, breaking down each piece of research to explain how it relates to these models. It also critiques the strengths and weaknesses of these studies.\n\nSleep disorders come in all shapes and sizes. You've got primary sleep disorders like dyssomnias or parasomnias, which are standalone issues. Sleep disorders tied to another mental disorder usually fall under Axis I or Axis II disorders, which cover things like clinical and personality disorders. There's also sleep disorders linked to medical complications or substance intake. Let's break down the dyssomnias a bit: Primary Insomnia is when you can't get enough sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is when you can't stay awake. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are behavioral and physical issues that happen during sleep, like Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The review focuses on insomnia, and it dabbles a bit in primary sleep disorders in general.\n\nNow, the Biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, inherited traits, and physiological factors. Neurons in the hypothalamus, which produce orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that GABAB receptors on these neurons control sleep-wake states. When these receptors are activated, they promote sleep, and if they're not firing correctly, it can cause reduced anxiety and sleep disturbances. A GABAB agonist, baclofen, extended sleep time in the study (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests that what's happening in mice can be similar in humans, showing a genetic and environmental basis for sleep disorders. If there's a problem with these receptors, it could impact sleep without medication, affecting life aspects like school, career, and routine tasks.",
            "This paper delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD): a brief definition, diagnosis, and strategies for teachers in mainstream classrooms to assist students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) is essentially a breakdown in the brain's ability to process sounds we hear. In other words, people with CAPD can hear normally, but their brain struggles to translate and understand sounds, particularly in noisy environments or when distinguishing between words. This disorder is often referred to as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) and was first identified in the mid-1950s, when researchers termed it \"auditory imperception.\" The journey to understanding CAPD includes pivotal contributions from researchers like Kimura and a national conference in 1977.\n\nSymptoms of CAPD vary but can include difficulty hearing sounds in space, distinguishing between sounds, recognizing sound patterns, and detecting changes in speech. People with CAPD might also struggle with sound synthesis, where they can't interpret sounds meaningfully, and may have trouble determining the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosis involves thorough screening by professionals like audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. Tests range from simple questionnaires to advanced acoustic signal recordings. It's important to note that there's no single, foolproof test or known cause for CAPD.\n\nTo support a student with CAPD in a mainstream classroom, teachers can adopt various strategies. These might include reducing background noise, clearly enunciating instructions, and providing visual aids. Encouraging the student to face the teacher or use assistive listening devices can also help. The key is to create an environment that minimizes auditory distractions and maximizes understanding.",
            "So what do you think about Shakespeare's Twelfth Night and the whole business of disguise? Well, it seems that while dressing up as someone else might be useful for pulling off a long con, in the end, you've got to shed that disguise or risk losing yourself. But watch out, 'cause when you finally come clean, you might find yourself all alone, cut off from the people you care about. After all, some folks might just take it in stride, but others, well, they might not be too happy about being fooled. And let's talk about gender swap deception, 'cause that's got its own set of issues. So why do people feel the need to hide behind a disguise? Take Viola for example. She's new in town, so she decides to masquerade as a man to keep herself safe. Her plan works, but it also makes her feel alienated from other women, and to top it all off, Olivia ends up falling in love with her. And don't even get me started on the whole Viola-Cesario-Orsino thing. It's like Viola is trapped in this love triangle, and she's the only one who doesn't know what's going on. You'd think that Shakespeare was trying to show us how deception can help release hidden emotions, but when you dig deeper, it's like Olivia is just judging people based on what they look like. I mean, she goes from being smitten with Cesario to acting like Viola is her sister. It's like she can't make up her mind. So yeah, deception can have some weird effects on people, but at the end of the day, it's all about choices. Do you risk losing yourself, or do you risk losing the people you care about?",
            "German colonial rule has been widely noted for its harshness, particularly the genocide committed against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, it's crucial to remember that nothing as vast as a colonial empire can be explained through a single description. The German colonial empire was as diverse in its policies and ruling styles as it was in its geography. Educational provision across the colonies varied greatly. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a significant population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also commended by contemporary authors. The situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike in East Africa, where the government played a major role in educating the locals, in South West Africa, native education was largely left to missionary societies that received minimal government support. The government did, however, invest heavily in educating Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and providing significant support to missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after German rule ended. While other German colonies boasted substantial numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper seeks to delve deeper into these factors and focus on new research regarding the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. There is a substantial body of literature on education within the German colonial empire, with many of these sources written in German and dating from the early 20th century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. Early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems in these colonies, while later works expanded this discourse through comparative studies and more detailed analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant differences across the colonies' educational systems. Cohen’s study on education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly notable. Cohen compared the educational systems of both colonies and discussed the factors contributing to the differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa accounted for many of the colony’s educational system's distinctive features. Compared to other German colonial possessions, South West Africa had a climate that was generally more temperate, with large portions covered by arid desert. This moderated climate attracted a relatively substantial European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population, had only 5,336 whites.",
            "So, over the past 100 years, the classification of pop music has expanded to include countless genres, making it a challenge to list them all. To make matters more complex, most, if not all genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres. Within this vast landscape, the sub-genre of heavy metal rock has proven to be one of the most diverse and expressive, with a history of innovation dating back 40 years.\n\nToday, heavy metal has evolved into a genre with countless niches, making it difficult to define what it truly is. It has absorbed themes and influences from numerous other genres, but it all started somewhere. To comprehend the heavy metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp the essence of the metal movement and why it is more than just a genre.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is defined by its darkness. It's often dubbed a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. It's less primitive and more skilled, with metal bands often showcasing exceptional instrumental prowess. Additionally, metal is heavily associated with drug use. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s led to the creation of some of the genre's most iconic, otherworldly records. This drug influence has also been a significant factor in the movement's dark, visceral qualities, which were somewhat novel in the context of popular music at the time. Furthermore, later generations have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements of the Romantic Era, as seen in lyrics like these from Helter Skelter by The Beatles:\n\nThese lyrics demonstrate the darker side of The Beatles, exhibiting an up-and-down rhythm that some attribute to drug use. This song is often considered one of the first heavy metal tracks, serving as a response to a heavier, darker Rolling Stones song. The Beatles aimed to prove they could be as heavy as the Stones, resulting in this iconic track on The White Album.",
            "Once upon a time, long before the Surrealist artists painted their dreamlike masterpieces, there was Henri Rousseau, an artist who literally and figuratively crafted his own dreams. The Dream, a 1910 piece by the Post-Impressionist artist, isn't just about a woman in awe of her dreamt land; it's a reflection of Rousseau's personal dreams and aspirations as a painter. He dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but faced a tough internal struggle: should he conform to or mimic certain painting styles to gain acceptance, or forge his own unique path?\n\nBefore diving into The Dream, let's explore Rousseau's life story. Born in Laval, northwest France, on May 21, 1844, he was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer. He grew up without formal art training and worked as a gabelou (municipal toll employee) until he was 40. After his first wife, Clémence, and eight of their infant children passed away, Rousseau was left with his daughter Julia and immense grief. Painting became his escape and fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries who idealized peasants in their art, Rousseau was a folk painter, dreaming of the average class's hopes and dreams.\n\nRousseau's desire for art world acceptance is understandable in context. Uneducated in art, he started painting late and worked alongside other accomplished artists. Recognition came to him when Matisse was gaining traction. According to Jan Gordon in Modern French Painters, both artists were different: Matisse feared painting tritely, while Rousseau dreamed of a conventional picture that would gain him entry into the Artiste Français.",
            "Many a great thinker has suggested a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe this is because, at the core of it, there is a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats puts it in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nMore to the point, criticism of art or morals can never fully capture the essence of what is good or beautiful. For instance, a conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa may discuss foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not explain why it is good art. Typically, when asked about a favorite work of art or literature, we often hear, “There's just something about it” before a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals cannot be fully reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O’Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how well we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is always something intangible that is left unsaid. I believe the same is true for ethics. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\nI believe morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenal level, using a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, such as music, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.”",
            "Germany, as we know it today, is a robust and unified nation, a living tapestry of cultures that stretch from the majestic peaks of the Alps in München to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This unique cultural blend can be felt from the bustling streets of Köln on the Rhine, through the heart of Germany, all the way to the elegant city of Dresden, nestled along the Elbe. Given this diversity, it's no surprise that Germany's identity has been shaped by various sources and tribes.\n\nThe land of the Germans was once known as Germania. The origins of its name are hotly debated among scholars. Tacitus, a Roman historian, suggested the name came from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and fought against the Gauls. Julius Caesar, in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes who often crossed the Rhine for warfare. The exact origin is uncertain, with some proposing it could come from the German spear, known as a ger, or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating that the Germans were loud or noisy.\n\nEarly Roman historian Tacitus wrote in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" that he believed the Germans were aboriginal, having not mixed with other races through immigration or contact. He wondered, who would leave the fertile lands of Asia or Africa to settle in Germany, with its harsh climate, rugged landscape, and stern people? The Romans, for their part, did not initially settle in Germania. They sent expeditions to trade with the Germanic tribes and occasionally led military campaigns, but they mostly returned to their sprawling empire. As Germanic tribes began emerging in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills with the Romans, and even serving in their army.",
            "I was staring down, my mind completely blank, trying to take in the view in front of me. Unemotionally, I studied the object, but I couldn't relate it to any deeper understanding. My thoughts were flowing in and out of my mind, so rapidly that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own. I was just experiencing the view as it was.\n\nOnce, on the advice of an artist I worked with, I bought a drawing book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had always wanted to learn how to draw since I was six, and this book teaches everything from understanding the pencil to how the brain interprets lines. One technique it teaches is to frame any picture you want to study in a square. This way, a complex picture, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, becomes simpler and more manageable.\n\nBut when I looked at the bowl of fruit in front of me, I couldn't mentally frame it. I was so overwhelmed and awestruck that I could only stare in wonderment. Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, and Renaissance masters used a rainbow of colors. If I had any artistic aspirations, then the bowl of fruit before me was the beginning of my art, the start of my story, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers touched the brush, my muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand moved through the air. I was giving shape and form to my thoughts, perhaps the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Flakes of matter broke away and disappeared. My hand hit the toilet handle again, my muscles tensing and jerking more anxiously the second time. The clogged brown package refused to budge, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.\n\nWith a mop in hand, I stood, feet apart, a green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat. I frowned, staring at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter left as a message for the cleaning crew at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more introspective moments, then my hand reached for the sheet of toilet paper, wrapping it like an oven mitt. Standing up, bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother preparing the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Another devastating reality we face is the alarming number of teenagers dying in car accidents. Multiple factors combine to create this deadly scenario for the youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health explain that the teen brain is not yet equipped to handle the dangers of driving, exacerbated by the lack of experience. This inexperience leads to more fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. Teens fare even worse when they're behind the wheel with their peers, and studies confirm that the presence of passengers increases the likelihood of accidents.\n\nTo address this problem, states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers. However, these measures are insufficient. The core issue is that, as a group, teens simply aren't ready to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes that even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license. He found that teens under 19-20 often crave the thrill of risk-taking, which makes it sensible to delay driving until these tendencies stabilize. Continuing to award licenses to young teens will likely result in more deadly accidents and a steep rise in the death toll among teen drivers in the coming years, especially as the Baby-Boomer’s babies become eligible to drive by 2010.\n\nLegislation to tackle this issue could be simple yet effective. Driver's education classes could continue in schools to start the learning process, but no one under 18 should operate a motor vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued before granting a full driver's license, with a set number of practical training hours required. The number of hours could be based on current state requirements, like California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice. To protect teens across the nation, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be sensible and effective.\n\nThe proposed legislation is not a groundbreaking idea, but a practical step towards reducing the number of teen driving fatalities.",
            "So I decided to dive into the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, specifically the trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen in total. I spent my time describing the poetic elements of most of these trick films and examining the unique characteristics of a few from the later years.\n\nMost trick films from the turn of the century were confined to a stage, composed within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement. They used long and medium shots, adhering to the rule of one shot equaling one film. However, some films at the beginning of the twentieth century dared to deviate from these guidelines by introducing elements like multiple shots.\n\nOne common trait among these trick films was their filming in an interior set within a frontal proscenium. The camera remained stationary, rooted in its position, not moving to follow figures or objects. This style was deeply rooted in theatre and vaudeville traditions. As a result, characters in these films mainly moved side-to-side, never walking towards or away from the camera. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move horizontally across the frame, but the camera never tracks them.\n\nThis proscenium style also leads to long and medium shots being the norm, with close-ups being almost non-existent. This aligns with theatre and vaudeville practices, where audiences would see the entire performance at once, framed by the stage's borders. Characters, therefore, generally stayed in the middle ground and did not move towards the camera, making close-ups uncommon.\n\nMost early trick films followed the pattern of one conceptual shot per film. This constraint limited the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limited their dramatic or narrative potential; most focused on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts, with little story. However, it’s important to note that in these films, a single conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes might not equate to a single physical shot. A single “shot” could actually be several joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) as an example. Upon close inspection, you can see the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, was a staunch and early proponent of Republicanism. Agriculture, his primary profession, and his short stint in politics made him a formidable advocate for personal liberty and government transparency. His commitment to agrarianism was the cornerstone of his views on governance, impacting his stances on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and even the judicial system.",
            "Well, let me take a look back at Figure 17, and there it is, a steep decline in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. That was certainly a bit of a letdown, and it's tough to pinpoint exactly why it happened. I mean, we're in New England, so it's natural that with the onset of winter, folks just aren't as inclined to commute by bicycle or on foot. Then there's the end of the fall semester, where everyone's heads are down, focusing on wrapping up schoolwork and grades. And let's not forget, December is filled with holiday cheer, which means many don't even need to come campus for weeks. Classes pick back up for the spring semester in late January, adding to the drop. But that doesn't explain February's low numbers. It's like any new project, we had a boost at the start, but then it's natural to see a decline. So, to give things a kick, we rolled out the Carpool Challenge Week in March, and that brought back the log submissions. But it's a challenge to keep that momentum going, especially when you've got holiday breaks and semester slowdowns. Then there's the fact that people are just so used to driving their cars. It's a big part of our culture. So, we had to find ways to incentivize alternative commuting. We gave out a bunch of gift certificates to local shops and services. It would've been interesting to see how bigger prizes like a bicycle or hybrid car would've boosted engagement. We stuck with the gift cards initially, but maybe if we'd announced a few bicycles in December and then a hybrid car in January, we'd have seen more participation.",
            "So, you know what an ETF is? It's like a security that follows an index, commodity, or a bunch of assets, but trades like a stock on an exchange. It gives you the good stuff of an index fund with the perks of owning individual stocks, like selling short, buying on margin, and buying just a single share. Sounds great, right? Well, there's the downside—you have to pay a commission for every trade, just like you would with stocks.\n\nNow, let's talk about another awesome thing about ETFs—they come in so many flavors! But here's a heads up, you gotta be smart and evaluate if these benefits really exist and how much they do. For this, we're looking at the ETF IHF and its top ten holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Let's take a peek at those top ten holdings and their percentages.\n\nTo see how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF, we'll calculate their contribution to a portfolio's Beta and Return, using the current percentage of assets. Here's the chart:\n\nFrom the chart, it's clear that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could give you a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, and a Beta 0.12 lower. It seems like a portfolio of just these top 10 could be a better deal.\n\nBut wait, before we get too excited, we gotta check if these two portfolios are actually different. To do this, we'll look at the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, and see how it compares to the ETF IHF's standard deviation.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's most highly regarded works is \"Dream-Land.\" Within this poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" which Mabbott traces back to the Roman poet Virgil. Virgil used this term in reference to an island north of Britain, the edge of the known world in Greek times. While Virgil's use of the term is undeniable, there's a more contemporary source that's often overlooked. Poe was deeply interested in German literature.\n\nThis point is crucial because it indicates Poe's familiarity with the works of Goethe. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws comparisons between Poe's and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe had imitated Goethe's style.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe's death, 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there's a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king who, after his wife's death, becomes a heavy drinker and eventually decides to end his own life. The similarities between the King of Thule and the description in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, perhaps a dark reflection of Poe's own experiences with loss and alcohol. \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just one year before Poe's use of the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references \"ultra Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but he employs the term \"Thule\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" bookending the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a dark and lonely landscape, haunted by the memory of dead friends and a world devoid of color, mirroring the state of the King of Thule after his wife's death. The poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into one of Goethe's creations.\n\nGoethe was a significant author who Poe would have been familiar with, not only because of his respect for Tennyson but also due to the many reproductions of Goethe's works that were circulating at the time.",
            "So, let me give you the lowdown on a legal scenario. Under California law, could a customer who got hurt after slipping on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages? This hypothetical customer, let's call them Jennifer Palmer, argues that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with malice because he was informed about the spill twice but chose to ignore it, delaying cleanup until he finished his dinner. Palmer could point to previous incidents where D&D customers had slipped and fallen, even though Martin was aware of the risk. The judge is unlikely to dismiss this claim outright because the evidence shows that Martin's actions were likely to cause harm and were intentional. However, the argument that his actions were despicable might be less convincing, given that there had been several slip-and-fall incidents in 2009, but still, Martin didn’t take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of his store. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee named Rich Wayne informed Martin about the apple spill, but Martin was on his dinner break and didn't want to deal with customer complaints. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill at 5:15 pm, but again, no action was taken. By 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell, suffering a serious back injury. D&D is now being sued for damages, and we are considering filing a motion to partially dismiss the punitive damage claim. In California, punitive damages can be awarded for conduct involving oppression, fraud, or malice. The law defines malice as conduct that intends to cause harm or, if there's no intent, conduct that's despicable and committed with a willful disregard for others' safety. The court has characterized conduct as malicious if the defendant was aware of the dangerous consequences and deliberately failed to avoid them. So, could Palmer's case be successful? Well, it's complicated, but it's definitely not a slam dunk.",
            "Just about four years back, I took a course on Islam at CBC. One of the main topics that sparked heated debates in class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion. I believe that this question is perhaps even more pertinent today than it was then. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I've witnessed a shift in the American media's portrayal of Islam, from a hostile view of extremists to an extreme form of tolerance. It's hard to imagine that in 2001, we could have ever seen a presidential candidate like Barak Obama, who has a Muslim background in his family, leading the conversation.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is quite fascinating. Based on what I know of his history, there seems to be a discrepancy between his biography and the personality I've come to understand. Before this course, I was under the impression that Muhammad forced converts to Islam. He would conquer tribes and force them to adopt the religion. However, the biography portrays him as a sort of martyr, misunderstood and even humble, who attracted people to his teachings without needing to compel them.\n\nMoreover, there are uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad. For instance, when Muhammad multiplied mutton and milk to feed forty men, it's a style of writing that makes me believe the authors wanted Muhammad to be seen as the humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything but simply lived in truth and miracles. This approach, to me, is problematic because it downplays the life and miracles of Jesus Christ. It's as if they're trying to steal and take credit for Jesus' life and personhood through Muhammad.\n\nAdditionally, there are many stories in the biography that seem to serve as proof of 'witness' or how people 'naturally' converted to Islam. However, many of these stories are told from the perspective of third parties. The author illustrates that they heard it from someone who heard it from someone else, and so on. I found this approach less convincing because, although it aimed to authenticate the stories, it made them seem more dubious.\n\nWhat bothers me the most about this work is how it tries to elevate Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. However, historical accounts contradict this notion of Muhammad being a gentle and humble man. I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus and his beliefs during his lifetime were quickly abandoned in the development of Christian thought that came after his life. If we look at this history with a broad perspective, we see a trend of Christianity moving further and further away from its origin. Today's world shows a growing awareness and unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditional people might resist new ideas, they may not be influential enough to change the whole. Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow in future years. There will be a desire to differentiate between the doctrines added to Christianity over time from Jesus' original intent. This reversal in Christian history will take decades or even centuries, but it is inevitable. A movement will grow that will peel away layers of doctrine, one after another, as if the clock were moving backward, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity remains. When this trend spreads through the United States and Europe, influencing masses to worship as if they were living during Jesus' time, following only his ideas, the church will remain strong to lead the way. However, as the theological clock moves backward, the extreme diversity in Christendom will reverse into more uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of all kinds, we will see increasing similarities instead of differences. History is filled with great reversions. For example, Christians were once persecuted and killed by the Roman Empire, but later, the empire became a Christian institution. Our country has moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play out in the Christian religion, undoing history to find its source and undoing diversity in the process. This process will be made possible by a method of reading Jesus' words as metaphorical, not as literal statements. What happened since Jesus' lifetime? If we look far back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning of Christianity. Monotheism, the belief in a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were at the core by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not united, dividing into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "I firmly believe that The Jungle demonstrates the intrinsic greed and self-centeredness of humans. At our core, we are driven to make our lives as comfortable and successful as possible, without much thought for those beneath us. This is evident in the behavior of the factory owners and managers, who prioritize their corporate interests above all else. They will stop at nothing to expand their empires, regardless of the harm caused to people or the environment. As Upton Sinclair describes, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery illustrates the stark disregard these industrialists have for the pollution and suffering around them, including the animal waste and toxic fumes that poison the air and soil.\n\nThe factory owners also displayed no concern for their workers' well-being. They exploited them harshly, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They forced workers to labor long hours and abruptly fired them en masse for any reason, leaving them jobless and without compensation. During the time The Jungle is set, there were few legal protections for workers, allowing the owners to operate with impunity. Employees were expected to endure the terrible conditions and accept the constant threat of job loss, with no recourse or aid.\n\nThe lack of unions or support organizations in Packingtown further exacerbated the plight of the workers. While some unions were formed, they often proved more exploitative than helpful, lining their own pockets from the workers' misfortune. This system of exploitation and oppression reduced workers to a state of near-slavery, with their lives and opportunities entirely at the mercy of the factory owners, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many writers employ various methods to evoke specific emotions or attitudes in their readers regarding significant subjects. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several of these techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he pairs adjectives and nouns in unusual ways to create a particular atmosphere around a subject. Other times, he ascribes symbolic significance to colors, which he later uses to convey feelings about certain objects. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald imbues colors like white/gray and red/pink with meaning and uses these meanings to evoke feelings about important subjects.\n\nFitzgerald's association of white/gray with uniformity is particularly notable. He establishes this meaning early in the novel by frequently using these colors. Daisy and Jordan are often described as \"in white\" (8), and nearly everyone at Gatsby's party wears white, including Nick in \"white flannels\" (41), Tom in a \"white shirt\" (36), and Catherine as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exceptions are when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where he notices \"gaudy primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald also uses white/gray to describe common or unremarkable subjects, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray old man\" (27) selling dogs. After building up these associations, Fitzgerald employs white/gray to signify uniformity or insignificance. This technique begins with Daisy, whom he describes as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster,\" making her seem less like a character and more like a uniform object Gatsby desires (74). Fitzgerald employs this approach with Daisy repeatedly, further emphasizing her uniformity, as seen in her \"gray haze\" and later in a white dress (115) before her encounter with Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County's mild, sunny climate makes it a powerhouse in agriculture. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers flourish here. There's a thriving demand for organic, community-supported agriculture in the area, with many local organizations boasting long waiting lists for produce. Organic eggs and milk are also popular among locals. Many organic farms offer tours and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching, generating additional income and educational opportunities.\n\nOrganic farming, while offering greater biodiversity and habitat improvement, comes with higher costs. It demands more intensive labor and management to control pests and weeds without chemicals. Losses can be higher, and small farms lack the economies of scale of larger operations. Non-organic practices beneficial to wildlife, like planting cover crops, strategic grazing, and invasive species removal, also come at a labor cost. Therefore, a landowner in this situation might seek financial assistance or expertise to optimize profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe chosen property is a 160-acre parcel in Potrero, San Diego County, California, featuring chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland near the Cleveland National Forest. It's part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion under the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which lists over a hundred species, many of them endangered or declining, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, certain butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nNative Americans inhabited this land for centuries, followed by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This land was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production. I chose this property from a real estate website, researching available government programs to help a small farmer mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. An organic farm in the same area serves as a model for what this land could achieve.",
            "Culture plays a big role in any negotiation. It's not just about what culture is, but also what it isn't and what it stands for. Culture isn't uniform and isn't just national or international; it varies from place to place. Sayings like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are too broad. A better approach is to understand how a culture's attitude can affect negotiations. When meeting a foreign culture, you naturally compare it to your own, which is natural. To understand a culture, you might look at its history or its prejudices. Don't judge or try to change it; instead, work within its boundaries, especially if you're at a weaker bargaining position. If you're in a foreign environment, respecting traditions and beliefs can help overcome barriers. It's also important to remember that a culture isn't just national—many companies within a nation have their own corporate culture, which can affect dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. For example, some companies encourage philanthropy while others restrict it. Even in American culture, corporate attitudes vary widely. Some cultures may appear more uniform but are still worth digging deeper into. Values are crucial too, as they explain why a culture is the way it is. If saving face is important in a culture, you won't publicly shame your company or superior to win a negotiation. A hard-driven bargain might be more important in another culture, so not settling early is key. Understanding these cultural nuances before negotiations begins is important, but also learning about your opponent personally can make negotiations more effective.",
            "Okay, so here's a familiar quote, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’\" This is from Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and it's the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about God's existence. This idea is also shared by another author, Thomas Aquinas. Since we're comparing their arguments, we'll assume both are right about the existence of a god, particularly the one from the Bible. Otherwise, comparing their arguments wouldn't make sense. Now, while they both have valid points, neither really provides a complete reason to believe in this God.\n\nLet's start with St. Anselm's basic argument. He suggests that you can find proof of God's existence within your own mind. It's all about understanding through faith. He says that since God is within our understanding, we can't doubt his existence. This is a bit wordy, but essentially, he's saying that God is proven by what we already know within our own minds. No outside evidence needed, that's what faith is all about.\n\nNow, Thomas Aquinas takes a different approach. He believes you can prove God's existence through reason and empirical evidence, no faith required. This would be great for bringing in new converts, as they could be convinced by logic alone. He presents five different logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument shows that God's existence is a logical necessity. It's like saying, if you know you're missing one piece of a puzzle, you can figure out what it looks like without actually seeing it.\n\nSo, in short, both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas bring up good points, but neither provides a solid, complete reason to believe in God.",
            "Around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince known as Siddhartha Gautama was born. He later became Buddha and his teachings gave birth to Buddhism, with the most traditional branch being Theravada. The religion has been around for nearly 2500 years, growing and changing over time. You can see this evolution in places like Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. While Buddha didn't teach about such a ceremony, monks and laypeople still participate, illustrating how the religion has evolved. This evolution isn't limited to superficial practices but also extends to its core beliefs. The Theravada community has had to adapt their doctrines, influenced by both internal and external factors, both hostile and benign.\n\nThroughout this discussion, I'll use several key terms. Internal forces refer to those from within the Buddhist community, regardless of whether they are monks or laypeople. External forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that seek to harm or damage Buddhism, driven by a negative perception. Benign forces, on the other hand, don't necessarily wish to support or harm the Buddhist community but might do so incidentally.\n\nBefore diving in, let's understand Theravada Buddhism's core principles. Buddhists take refuge in the Triple Gem—the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka sets out rules for life, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts is key to escaping Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and overcoming lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides rules for laypeople and monks. Laypeople follow five precepts, while monks have many more rules to abide by. The most fundamental belief in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: life is Dukkha (suffering), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome, and there is a path to enlightenment.",
            "The United States and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the U.S. defeated Mexico and gained Texas and the American Southwest. There were other disputes between the two nations, which persisted until the First World War. The rivalry originated from disagreements on religion, culture, and tradition, as well as differing material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis is similar to how many other nations have enduring rivalries with their neighbors, often driven by shared borders and conflicting interests. The U.S. and Mexico are not unique in this regard, with David M. Pletcher (1977) noting that only Mexico and Cuba have had long-lasting overarching American diplomatic issues (p. 41). These nations are geographically close to the U.S. and have historically been rivals, unlike most other Latin American countries which have maintained good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences have often been a source of tension between nations, a trend seen throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) highlights that in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy (p.86), much like the Cold War rivalry between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which was partly ideological and partly a competition over vital interests. However, in this case, the ideological strife was rooted in religious preferences rather than political structures. This mistrust stemmed from the historical enmity between the English and Spanish, which made establishing friendly foreign relations difficult.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes were territorial issues, involving border raids and frontier problems. Bandit and outlaw attacks from American border towns were a significant issue until both nations employed military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nThe rivalry began to fade as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the U.S., and finally ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico later in the 19th century (Schmitt 1974, p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly struck down by an illness I had never known existed. I was a nurse, having chosen this profession out of a deep longing for the safety and security I hadn't experienced as a child. The mantra \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick\" echoed through my adolescence and beyond. Despite dreaming of a career in science or journalism, I opted for nursing. Yet, here I am: 46 years old, single, with no financial stability and unable to work. My disability persists, and after 15 years of relying on Social Security Disability, I have little left to call my own. Each day is a struggle, a relentless assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, but one thing is clear: I couldn't have endured for all these years without the support of my family and a few trusted friends. And let me tell you, when real disaster strikes, you don't feel strong at all.\n\nThe lesson here is that life is filled with emergencies, both big and small. No amount of preparation can guarantee that you'll overcome everything on your own. I wholeheartedly agree that we should cease relying solely on big government. I'd much rather see Americans learn to trust one another again, to help each other and to ask for help, rather than each of us retreating to our backyards to build fallout shelters.\n\nConservatives in the U.S. often talk about \"rugged individualism\" as the force that built this country. But the truth is, our forefathers didn't cross the Rockies in wagon trains alone. It was compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that saw them through hard times.\n\nSo, do prepare. I have supplies: a disaster kit with first aid, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape, flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources for a small farm, and the ability to can or preserve food, do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment. But while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms change over time? Are there any limitations or rules that dictate how they evolve? While in 1917 D'Arcy Thompson noted that “Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,” the same can be said today. Modern mathematical modeling has been applied to study mollusk skeletogenesis through both development and evolution, as seen in works by Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our research explores how combining mathematical modeling and experimental studies can help understand the mechanisms driving evolutionary and developmental change in Prunum. We analyzed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative traits, which were entered into the software program CerioShell. By creating hypothetical shell morphologies, we aimed to interpret the limits of possible morphological changes in Prunum. These results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better comprehend macroevolutionary events within this group.\n\nImagine a shell as a structure that spirals through 360 degrees of space over time, forming a coiled structure called a whorl. These whorls turn around an imaginary central column, known as the columella, which runs through the shell's center. The rate at which whorls grow can vary, and the line separating each whorl is called a suture. Most shells have the largest whorl as the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire includes all whorls except the last, with the apex at the top and the base at the bottom. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles: apical (top), basal (bottom), apertural (front), and abapertural (back). The usual orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical side and identify where the first suture starts. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts and count whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. This movement can be traced using coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture along with horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, parameters can be varied to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Another month has come and gone, and despite the lack of significant changes in my life, a few notable events have transpired. Indonesia's progress on reducing neonatal and infant mortality over the past decade has been lackluster, despite making strides towards meeting some Millennium Development Goals. Specifically, the target goals for child and maternal health are far from being met by the 2015 deadline. Several factors contribute to this, suggesting that the overall health system needs bolstering rather than just programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen improvements in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% meeting this criterion. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions in complicated pregnancies, leading to a high number of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. This improvement is somewhat misleading, and there's still much work to be done. Additionally, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional, and the data on postnatal care is incomplete, indicating a concerning trend.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain below the expected level, at about 4%. Urban areas have a c-section rate of 7%, compared to just 2% in rural settings. This highlights the issue of healthcare equity, as services are primarily concentrated in urban areas. There's also a stark difference in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, with a 27% gap, pointing to difficulties for the poor in accessing healthcare services due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering how to tackle the lack of service in improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is whether Indonesia should focus on program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system. While programmatic approaches offer targeted and manageable objectives and faster results, they can lead to funding imbalances, resource allocation issues, and duplication of services. The challenge lies in determining the most effective path forward.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous detail and fixation on the aristocracy of the era. Notably, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights deviate from this norm, incorporating mystery and eccentricity to enrich the characters and their motivations.  The two novels often employ dreamlike elements to convey a sense of unease and confusion, which helps to deepen the reader's understanding of the characters' emotions and inner turmoil.\n\n\"Suddenly, a cacophony of bewildering and disorientating ideas flooded his mind. He seemed to be walking with Sikes and Crackit, who were engaged in a heated argument. Their voices echoed in his ears, as if they were happening right then. Abruptly, he realized he was speaking to them. Then, a report of gunfire echoed through the air, and a rush of lights and shouts filled his vision. He was being swiftly carried away by an unseen force. Through this flurry of images, a constant, gnawing awareness of pain lingered, tormenting him.\n\nHis experience with the shooting, revisited in Chapter 28, was revisited in a vivid dream-like state as he struggled to seek help. This passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events and the desperate state of his health, evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself numbed all his senses, and he did not even notice the 'unseen hand' that bore him away. The pain was now a constant, linked with fear rather than surprise. This experience raises questions about whose will brought about his misfortune, as it certainly wasn't his own. This shooting highlights Oliver's lack of control over his life, as he couldn't even attempt to influence the outcome, even as his life was in jeopardy, a growing sense of defeat is implied, suggesting that Old Fagin had begun to break his spirit, forcing him to accept despair and limiting his ability to react. Had Oliver not been in such a state, he might have made some effort to save himself.\n\n'The day passed – a day? It was gone before it came, and night returned, long and silent, yet fleeting in its duration. The night was a long, dreadful silence, yet short in its passing.'\"",
            "A couple of years ago, I worked at an after-school program tutoring elementary students. I did my best to assist them with their subjects, but my strengths were in English and reading. I was asked by one of the instructors to help a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. He seemed to have peculiar reading issues. He could pronounce some letters perfectly while others were way off. I realized something was wrong; he was of Latino descent, yet he spoke perfect English. We struggled until I met his mother. She spoke only Spanish. With my limited Spanish skills, we communicated, and that's when it hit me: Adrian could read but didn't know the English alphabet well. I'm not sure if this revelation helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the challenges of the language barrier in schools, especially in California. Even if a child speaks perfect English, reading it can still be difficult. This problem is evident, and so what do we do? In Adrian's case, the solution was straightforward: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There is no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—no single solution will fix this problem. The key is to combine all these approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a fantastic idea. It's beneficial not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all kids. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" Many fears surround this idea, that it's a waste of resources and that most children won't benefit. But this isn't true. If we implemented these programs more widely, all children would reap the benefits. How do we do this? Should all teachers be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic. However, there's no reason we can't have bilingual aides or tutors to support these programs.",
            "Just as we grow up, many of us are told from a young age that there is something greater than ourselves, something beyond our comprehension. Some of us are introduced to this concept through Sunday school, others through Temple, or we explore it within ourselves. Some readily accept the beliefs passed down by our parents, while others reject them entirely, denying the existence of anything beyond our personal experiences. Our journey to define part of ourselves often involves spiritual exploration, searching for a guiding light to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun. “A cardinal,” my father replied when I asked him about his favorite bird. We sat on the front porch, listening to the rain pour down, while we smoked our cigarettes. He looked out into the rain, as if looking back in time. He had become frail, his clothes loose on his body, and his hair sparse. He gazed into the rain, avoiding eye contact. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him, as it would only make it more real. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer, and joined him in watching the rain fall on the June twilight. My father passed away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. Chemotherapy and radiation did not ease his suffering but prolonged it a few months. I could not watch him pass away, as I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news. No one called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel,\" as described by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, is essentially a blend of \"Old-New,\" much like an oxymoron. The Gothic genre has been both criticized and celebrated, often accused of lacking depth and praised for its \"terrible sublime\" atmosphere (Burke). The original Gothic novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, merged the elements of both ancient and modern romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new form of literary expression. Walpole incorporated old theatrical elements and the mimicry of nature in modern novels to present a \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often references medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various cultures, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to modern societal and literary advancements. The fusion of traditional Gothic elements and the new format of the novel, allowing readers a more personal view of characters' psychology, is what has kept the Gothic genre relevant for so long, making it both obsolete and fresh to readers far removed from the original era.\n\nA key concept in Gothic novels is the idea of Chivalry. The medieval concept of knightly training and the chivalric ideal, both retained and transformed in The Castle of Otranto, are central to Gothic literature. Chivalry was important to Gothic writers because it represented the classic knight—brave, honorable, and competent—contrasted with their perceived lack of these qualities in contemporary society. By using chivalric themes and manners, the Gothic past is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the evolution of Gothic to Romanticism and serving as a means to improve the present. Walpole, writing during a politically tumultuous time, may have felt that the supposed morality and inherent goodness of the Gothic era had been lost in society. This is evident in his characters, like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits. Before meeting Frederic, he is described as:",
            "Supply chain management is the sequence of processes moving goods from the order point to the final delivery to the customer. The term was coined by Keith Oliver, a consultant, in 1982. He described it as the planning, implementation, and control of everything that occurs within the supply chain to satisfy customer needs quickly and efficiently. Six key elements make up a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these elements to deliver top-notch customer service.\n\nFirst among these elements is production, the backbone of the supply chain. This stage lays out when, where, how, and why products will be produced. Managers must understand what customers want, which they can determine by examining the market. Once they analyze the market and grasp customer demand, they can decide which products to produce and in what quantities. After setting production targets and choosing the best facilities, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Every detail is crucial in production, as improper planning can lead to significant time and money losses. For instance, I worked at Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business had a designated process, from employee uniform design to receiving shipments. Clear, outlined processes ensure smooth operations without confusion or mismatches in expectations.\n\nThe second key element is supply, which involves strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with unique equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division best suits each part of the product process. They may also choose to outsource work to other companies to achieve velocity – the ability to deliver quality and flexibility while keeping costs low.",
            "Just today, I saw a peculiar sign in the street. It read, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, the star of Juno, stood alone on the corner, holding a piece of cardboard with this ominous message. Burma, or Myanmar as it's also known, is a Southeast Asian country that's been under the iron grip of a tyrannical military junta since 1962, when they seized power through a coup d'état. In 2007, street protests erupted, led by Burmese monks, marking the first public demonstrations in a decade. These protests, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution,\" initially saw peaceful gatherings but soon escalated into violent clashes between the monks and the military junta, with monasteries being ransacked and foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai, being imprisoned or even killed, like on September 27th, 2007. The official death toll stands at 13, but a defected colonel from the army suggests the real number could be in the thousands.\n\nThis isn't an isolated incident. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, and even our current president, George W. Bush, is said to consult with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a branch of the Republican Party. Notable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, workers, and students were killed in the hundreds to thousands. There was also the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups and the government systematically murdered Tutsis and political moderates, irrespective of ethnicity. And who can forget Hitler's Third Reich, where Jews were systematically rounded up and killed across several countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact on jazz is largely due to his endurance and his ability to mold his orchestra. His piano presence is often subtle in his compositions, but as a composer, Ellington excelled at creating intricate and deep pieces that highlighted the individual skills of his band members. Ellington crafted a framework where soloists could freely improvise and wrote tightly arranged pieces and phrases that showcased the unique style of each band member, emphasizing the overall tone of the orchestra to create consistent and original sounds for each piece. His mastery of individual players' sounds and how they complemented each other in a growing ensemble allowed him to write some of jazz history's most innovative and brilliant works. The Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington’s use of voice as an instrument, with Creole Love Call being an early example of this. This piece uses voice to add texture and color without lyrics, and also showcases Ellington's ability to complement his soloists, a trait evident throughout his career. Creole Love Call features six choruses, each with distinct elements such as voice and reed call and response, muted trumpet solos, and full band echoes. Ellington's use of voice to add tone color is just one of his stylistic traits that permeate his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines tight orchestration with an ear for tone color. He uses a call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, with Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton playing a key role in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Another day had passed, and I'd been feeling that persistent itch again, that gnawing need for something, anything. This sensation had been a constant companion since I hit puberty, now three years strong. It started as a desire for things, but had morphed into a craving for someone. Yet, the right someone had eluded me. Boys had shown interest, but none had sparked anything within me. I'd spent years puzzling over this peculiar predicament, but it was a mystery that remained unsolved. So, I carried on with life, my mind a whirlwind of questions and curiosity.\n\nA typical day at home was usually a peaceful symphony, with my parents as the calm conductors. They never raised their voices, and their daughter was a rare fly in the ointment. Arguments were few and far between, except for my insistence on asserting my independence. I was a likeable, nice girl, but my spirited personality was a stark contrast to my parents' calm demeanor.\n\nToday, however, was far from that usual serenity. As I wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration for my own soul, a shriek from the kitchen pierced the air. My mother's voice echoed through the house, and I rushed to the kitchen, heart pounding. \"Mom? Mom, what's wrong?!\" I shouted, panic rising. My mother lay on the floor, groaning and clutching her side. \"Ow... sweetie... I... need you to take me to the hospital,\" she managed to say, her words rushed and pained. I quickly gathered her, cradling her in my arms, and carried her to the car. That morning's leisurely walk transformed into a mad dash to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital's sterile scent filled my nostrils, but my mind was too focused on helping my mother. I rushed her to the triage, calling for assistance. A flurry of medical personnel surrounded us, taking her away to be evaluated. I was left to wait, worry gnawing at me.\n\nMom had fallen from a stepladder while trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet in the house.",
            "Another study has revealed that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), shown by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed), is linked to a lower risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as reduced stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a tweaked version of the Med diet, with more plants like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, more monounsaturated fats compared to saturated ones, and less animal products and saturated fats. Drinking alcohol in moderation is also part of the diet.\n\nPrevious research has indicated that following the Med diet lowers the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality and is better than a low-fat diet for weight loss and lowering cholesterol levels in those who are overweight. However, previous studies didn’t focus on the risk of stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study observed over 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, with no prior history of heart disease or diabetes, from the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort of nurses in 11 US states. Six times, over 20 years from 1984 to 2004, they calculated an aMed diet score based on food intake reported by the nurses. Over 95% of the nurses participated throughout the study. To ensure reliability, the reported data and health outcomes were verified by medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Body mass index (BMI), smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were also tracked, and starting in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo account for variations in individual food intake, an average aMed score from the repeated food frequency questionnaires was calculated. Adjustments were made for factors that could affect the results, such as age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing the Cox proportional-hazard model, the study examined the relationship between the aMed diet score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal cases.\n\nThe research found that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of heart disease and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, there were 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths. Women in the top aMed group had a lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest group (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, the United States of America was struck by a devastating financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market tanked, and some of the country’s most significant corporations were left in shambles. This recession continues to this day, so let's delve into how this happened and how we can prevent it from recurring. In essence, the financial crisis was the result of self-serving and naive political choices that compelled banks and firms to issue sub-prime loans, further stressing an already fragile and insufficient financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to back and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks found themselves short on capital reserves, passing the chaos to the repacked mortgages they had sold, and onward to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe roots of this crisis can be traced back to the Clinton era in 1999. The President was in the midst of a reelection bid, aiming to bolster his popularity by relaxing lending restrictions. This move laid the groundwork for the sub-prime crisis that would unfold seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999 that, “Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest mortgage underwriter, was under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals and faced pressure from shareholders to maintain its remarkable profit growth.” Holmes accurately predicted the repercussions of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation could face trouble in a downturn, necessitating a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As mentioned in the introduction and foreseen by Holmes, ill-advised lending would indeed plunge the economy into crisis.\n\nSeveral factors combined to send the economy spiraling, one of which was the intricate structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, further intertwining different sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets becoming overly leveraged in the housing market, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had purchased mortgage-backed securities in financial misery. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt by 2007, which represented about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to become commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",

            "I caught two news segments from Columbus, Ohio today, August 13, 2011. The first was a live broadcast from NBC 4. The main story was about a bloke named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. Not much about her, but they showed his mug shot and he looked like he was straight out of a bad horror movie. They only gave it about two minutes, which seemed about right given it was still an unfolding story. The second story was about some kid named Travis Buyers, 18, who got shot in the Sharon Woods area and was in critical condition. They didn't have any arrests yet and the SWAT team was on the case. This story was a bit short, which might have been because it was a \"black\" man or a black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that minorities get less coverage when they're victims of a crime. If it's a white child or adult, the media goes nuts, but minorities are lucky if they even get a mention. The next story was about finding a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. They said it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the chopper. Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. The storm updates were next; they said Saturday's afternoon would have rain and thunderstorms, with temperatures in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. They kept it brief but it was a teaser to keep you watching. They also had a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. A dark-skinned black man robbed the store, they emphasized his blackness and how dark he was. Another guy named Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin, was sentenced for conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts from Texas to Ohio. They strangely used \"300 months\" instead of \"25 years\" in prison. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, but I don't think that was relevant to the story.",
            "The bond between brothers is something special; a tie that cannot be easily broken. This bond is a canvas for many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers have a unique understanding of each other, a connection that goes deeper than any other relationship. This bond is most visible in times of crisis, where the true nature of their feelings for one another becomes clear, whether it is for good or for ill. The consequences of these emotions are significant, and understanding them is key to navigating this complex relationship. When one brother looks into the eyes of another, they see not just their sibling but a reflection of themselves. Their actions and the results of their actions reveal their true character. This theme is beautifully depicted in \"The Scarlet Ibis\", where two brothers embark on an ill-fated journey through a lush, vividly described landscape. The story is told through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex feelings and his view of the world. These feelings heavily influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, tragic journey, the protagonist feels a sense of resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother who could share his worldly skills, like holding breath underwater, running, jumping, or climbing trees. He wanted a brother who could join him in adventures like running to Horsehead Landing or perching in the tall pine tree behind the barn. However, Doodle's condition—an extremely weak heart—made these dreams unachievable. The protagonist's dreams were shattered, and he felt anger towards the child. He even considered smothering Doodle with a pillow to end his life. What kind of child would have such thoughts? However, his heart softened when Doodle smiled at him. This simple act of love gave him hope, showing that his conviction to harm Doodle was not strong. In the back of his mind, he still loved his brother, despite his resentment.",
            "The human brain is a complex, innovative information processing system. Over the ages, as technology evolved from primitive to modern, so did the metaphors used to understand the brain. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and more recently, a computer. As you explore the brain, keep in mind that these metaphors, while useful, can also lead to misconceptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs, which convert physical sensations like touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. These signals are transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when you see a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing integrates simple information like color and orientation to identify it as a box. Top-down processing then supports this recognition, helping you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole.\n\nOnce information is processed, an attention filter determines its importance and directs it to the relevant cognitive processes. For example, your brain processes every blade of grass when you look at your shoes, but a healthy attention filter discards these details, allowing you to focus on your name even in a noisy room. This filtering happens at various stages.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first be stored. Memory exists in different forms: sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded based on its type, such as structurally for visual stimuli or phonemically for auditory ones. Verbal input can be encoded semantically, referring to its meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Working memory, which holds data for about 20 seconds, is maintained by electrical signals looping through neurons. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained by structural changes in specific proteins.\n\nThere are various models of how knowledge is organized in the brain, influenced by human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model suggests that concepts (nodes) are connected based on their relatedness. For example, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley, in his novel Brave New World, takes aim at the encroaching threat of technology and the capitalist structure that reinforces it, painting a grim picture of a dystopian future. In this world, people prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned since birth to seek instant happiness above all else. The citizens are mere pawns in a larger game, confined to a single ideology imposed by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, Huxley's suspicions about the faults in the emerging economic system become evident. Terms like homogeny and reification highlight the societal conditioning that mirrors the faults of the capitalist system he sees around him.\n\nCapitalism is mocked through the concept of false consciousness, where the common people are kept unaware of their true economic relations, focusing solely on personal gain. This control is evident in the conditioning of Brave New World's citizens, who are driven to consume, spend, and indulge. This is manipulated by the World Controller, a form of hegemony where lower classes are unaware of their oppression, while upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, mostly accept their designated roles. The interactions between different classes are significant indicators of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nBrave New World presents a society where individual relationships are superficial and lack depth. Characters are indistinguishable from one another, suggesting that technology and capitalism strip people of their free will and expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent; interactions are kept shallow, with men focusing on women's physical attributes and women discussing their encounters without shame. This complacency with one's social status is a reflection of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are convinced of their superiority as long as they consume and conform to societal norms.",
            "So another semester has gone by, and here I am, still trudging along at University Park. It's been two and a half years since I started here, or four and a half semesters. Navigating this campus can be a real pain, especially when you're stuck in the farthest reaches, like East Halls. Back in my freshman year, I was all the way east, practically at the edge of the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. A 25-minute walk to classes in the Willard building, especially in bad weather, was a real chore. I found out from an alum that not too long ago, East Halls was separated from the rest of the campus by vast empty fields. Now that space is filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments, and campus expansion is making it even harder to get around. So, what's the solution? Bikes, of course! But they're only useful if students use them, and the campus needs to be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nI was chatting with a friend who recently picked up cycling after a few years off. He said, “Bikes are great, for a few years it wasn't cool to ride, but it's the most efficient way to get around.” Plus, they're good for your body. Just a bowl of oatmeal and a little effort can take you 30 miles or more. I live off campus now, as far from the center as some dorms. The smartest move I've made this year was buying a bike. Classes at Thomas building take 25 minutes to walk, but on a bike, it cuts that down to 5 minutes if you pedal hard. The only downside is Pollock Road, the straightest route from my house to Thomas, isn't always the easiest to ride. Still, I'd rather bike than walk, as it saves me an extra 30-40 minutes every day, which adds up to over two and a half hours a week. If I didn't have a bike, walking would be my only option, and that's just not feasible with my busy schedule."
