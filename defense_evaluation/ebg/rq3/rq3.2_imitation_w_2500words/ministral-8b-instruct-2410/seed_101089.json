            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

These core values are significant not only to social workers but also to me personally.\n\nI've always yearned to lend a helping hand, though I was uncertain about the right career path. Throughout my high school and college years, I observed many individuals shun their problems in denial, employing coping strategies that were less than optimal. Witnessing such situations, I decided to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Post-graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break. One summer, visiting a friend, I met a sixteen-year-old boy nervously sitting on her couch. Learning he had fled his abusive parents, I drove to his home to offer help. The police, unable to intervene further, asked me to speak with his parents. They seemed defensive and blamed his \"manipulative\" behavior for involving outsiders. This encounter convinced me to consider social work to aid children in family disputes.\n\nAnother vital aspect for social work is social justice. Our society claims to value individuality but often mourns lost souls while pushing everyone to conform to archaic norms.

            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to insomnia. The Biological model delves into genetic factors and medical aspects of sleep health, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental relationships and their influence on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models and chooses specific studies to illustrate and enhance our understanding of them. Each study's findings and explanations are then critically evaluated to highlight their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, those linked to other mental disorders, and those related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders like Dyssomnias and Parasomnias are standalone issues, while those related to mental disorders can be associated with Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). Other sleep disorders may result from medical complications or substance use. Key Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia (difficulty in adequate or maintained sleep), Primary Hypersomnia (difficulty staying awake for at least a month), Narcolepsy (cataplexy and/or automatic REM episodes), Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Parasomnias involve behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. This review primarily focuses on insomnia and touches on primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders centers around genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects. Orexin neurons in the hypothalamus regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice found that Phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons control sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. A GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in the study, suggesting the findings can be generalized to humans. This implies that genetic and environmental factors influence the functioning of the GABAB receptor in humans, affecting sleep without medication. If the receptor is altered, it can disrupt sleep, impacting aspects of life like school, career, and daily tasks requiring focus.",
            "So, this paper delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it provides a simple definition of the disorder. Following that, it explains how CAPD is diagnosed, highlighting common symptoms, or so-called \"red flags\". Lastly, it offers tips for how a teacher in a mainstream classroom can assist a student with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is essentially how efficiently the central nervous system (CNS) processes and uses auditory information. In other words, it's a condition where the brain fails to properly interpret sounds. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally but may struggle with separating words or differentiating conversations from background noise, making them appear as if they have hearing difficulties, although they don't.\n\nThe earliest known mention of this disorder was in the mid-1950s, when it was called \"auditory imperception\". Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began testing children with communication issues in 1954, and Canadian researcher Kimura later introduced dichotic testing in 1961. These developments sparked further research in the field.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: a person might struggle to pinpoint where sound is coming from, differentiate between multiple sounds, recognize sound patterns, detect changes in speech (like sarcasm), be distracted by subsequent sounds, or interpret the sequence of sounds correctly. Diagnosing CAPD involves observing the patient's listening behavior and performance on specific auditory function tests, conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, or others. There isn't a single, foolproof test for CAPD, nor is there a known cause for the disorder. Tests often present patients with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask them to identify specific items, like words or numbers. Advanced tests might involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "In \"Twelfth Night,\" it seems that while disguises can be handy for lengthy deceptions, ultimately, one must discard their masquerade to avoid losing their true self. The challenge with revealing a deception, though, is the potential for alienation from those around you. Some might remain unaffected, but others may take offense at being tricked.\n\nThe theme of gender disguise is complicated. It raises questions about why someone would adopt an opposite-gender identity. For Viola, it's a form of self-preservation: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249) Arriving in a new land, she feels the need to impersonate a man to protect herself. Her plan succeeds, but it isolates her from women, cutting her off from important support. She also faces issues with her romantic feelings for Sebastian/Orsino and Olivia's infatuation with Cesario/Viola: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\n\nHowever, this could be seen as a progressive outlook, showing how deception can expose hidden emotions. In Olivia and Orsino's case, it appears their subconscious desires are stirred by Cesario's presence. Is Olivia attracted to Cesario because he's a man, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? It's likely the former, as Olivia seems to change her affections quickly, switching from Cesario to Sebastian and considering Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",

The empire's policies and governance style varied greatly across its extensive territory. Educational initiatives were just as varied. For instance, when the British took over German East Africa (now Tanzania), they discovered a considerable number of educated and literate Africans. Similarly, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporary authors. However, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) was quite different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government played a significant role in educating the natives, in South West Africa, the education of locals was largely left to missionary societies who received minimal government support. The government did, however, invest substantially in the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies had numerous literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the overwhelming majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper aims to explore these factors and delve into new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\nThere's a plethora of literature on education in the German colonial empire, much of it written in German in the early 20th century, during or shortly after German rule. These early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems of the colonies. Later English-language works expanded on this by conducting comparative studies across the German colonies and offering more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in educational systems among the colonies. Cohen’s study on education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly notable. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and discusses the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa explains many of the distinctive features of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately pleasant climate, with much of the territory covered by arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913, there were nearly 15,000 whites in South West Africa, compared to just 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "Another decade has passed, with the evolution of popular music's classification reaching an unprecedented extent. The once broad spectrum of genres has now expanded to encompass so many sub-genres that it's practically impossible to enumerate them all. This is further complicated by the fact that even the most prominent genres, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres within their respective domains. Within this vast landscape, the sub-genre of heavy metal rock stands out as one of the most versatile and expressive genres of popular music over the past 40 years. It is expressive because it delves deeply into a wide array of emotions, often favoring the darker aspects of human experience. Its diversity lies in the early recognition of its flexibility, which allowed musicians to create their own sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, continuing this trend to the present day.\n\nToday, the heavy metal scene is so fragmented that identifying what constitutes heavy metal can be challenging. It has absorbed elements from various genres, yet it has its roots in something authentic. To truly grasp the metal music we encounter today, one must first understand the essence of the metal movement and why it transcends mere genre classification.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement rooted in darkness. It is a music of extremes—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. There is less simplicity, more skill. Musicians in metal bands are highly proficient, and this expertise is evident in their music. Metal is also intrinsically linked to the drug culture of the mid-70s, where psychedelic drugs fueled the creation of otherworldly records. It embodies dark, visceral qualities that were relatively uncharted territory in the music scene, where the darker emotional spectrum was often overlooked. Furthermore, later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prominent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following exemplify the darkness that permeates the movement:",
            "Way before the Surrealists were splashing dreamy colors onto canvas, Henri Rousseau was busy crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is a masterclass in his personal aspirations and internal tug-of-war. On one hand, he yearned for acceptance, recognition, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts. On the other hand, he struggled with whether to conform to established painting styles or forge his own path. The Dream encapsulates this lifelong conflict.\n\nTo truly grasp the significance of The Dream, let's first delve a bit into Rousseau's life. Born in Laval, northwest France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau didn't have much formal art training. Instead, he worked as a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, until the age of forty. Despite his plain circumstances, he dreamt of a new life through painting, offering solace after the tragedies of his first wife's and eight infant children's deaths. Unlike his peers, who romanticized peasants in their art, Rousseau remained a folk painter, reflecting the hopes and dreams of the average citizen.\n\nRousseau’s desire for acceptance was understandable given his situation. He started his artistic journey late and in the shadow of many renowned artists. He only began to gain recognition around the time Matisse was building his reputation. Jan Gordon in Modern French Painters notes that while both artists competed in the art world, their motivations were different. Matisse sought to paint unconventionally to avoid clichés, while Rousseau aimed to paint conventionally to be accepted by the Artiste Français (92).",
            "Many a great philosopher has pondered the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics. I believe this is because the essence of both lies in something ineffable. As John Keats put it in his famous \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty — That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While we often learn about ethics and aesthetics through education and experience, our appreciation of them seems to come naturally. Ethics and aesthetics, you see, are not about prescribing rules, but rather trying to understand why something is moral or beautiful. We grapple with the intricacies of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, talking about elements like contrast and cultural context, but in the end, the true reason behind its beauty eludes us. It's often that intangible \"something\" that makes us appreciate a piece of art or literature. This je ne sais quoi is what makes art and morality so powerful, and it's this transcendental nature that binds them together.\n\nWe experience both ethics and aesthetics at a deep, almost mystical level, a place where we can feel them but not entirely explain them. This is especially true of literature's moral quality, as McKean suggests. He notes that, unlike other arts like music, literature is uniquely tied to our moral lives because it reflects the values we hold dear. This moral quality is why literature is so important to us, and why ethics and aesthetics are so closely intertwined.",
            "Germany today stands as a mighty nation, its unique culture stretching from the alpine peaks of München to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This blend can be felt along the Rhine in Köln, through the heart of Germany, and into the Elbe Valley in Dresden. Given this diverse culture, it's not surprising that Germany, as we know it, is a fusion of various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a name with uncertain origins. Some scholars believe it came from the Germanic Tribe known as the Tungrians, who were later called Germans. Others think it might be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" suggesting loud or noisy people. Tacitus, in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98, describes the Germans as aboriginal and not intermingled with other races. He notes that no one would choose to leave the comforts of Rome for the harsh lands of Germania, unless it was their home. The Romans, while sending out expeditions to trade and conquer, mostly returned to their empire. This led to the Germanic tribes residing on the empire's borders, trading goods and skills, and sometimes serving in the Roman army.",
            "I stood there, staring down at the view in front of me, my mind blank like a canvas awaiting inspiration. Unemotionally, silently, I observed the picture before me, my practiced awareness taking it all in but refusing to connect it to any abstract idea. Thoughts flowed in and out of my mind so quickly, it was as if I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and fluid experience of what I was seeing. Once, an artist I'd worked with suggested I buy a book called 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain'. I'd been wanting to learn to draw since I was six, and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to how the brain interprets lines. One of the techniques it teaches is to place a square frame around any picture you want to study, turning a complex scene into a simple one. At the time, I couldn't quite mentally project that artist's frame. I was too overwhelmed, too awestruck to do anything but stand and gaze in wonderment. Picasso's blue phase, Monet's love for greenery, the Italian Renaissance masters' vibrant colors - if I had any artistic pretensions, here was where my picture began, my story started, 'Work in Brown'.\n\nMy hand touched the handle of my chosen tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as I guided it through space, my mind's will taking shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Pieces of matter broke away and were carried away to nothingness. But the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet with more urgency. The offensive brown package just wouldn't budge, stuck like a slug on the toilet's bottom. I stood there, a mop in hand, feet set a foot apart, a green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat. I frowned, staring at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more quiet moments to myself, and then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the end of the toilet paper, and began to wrap itself around and around like an oven mitt. Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "So another month has gone by, and of course, my life is pretty much the same old thing. Not much happened, except for the usual stuff. I've been thinking about teen drivers and the alarming rates of fatal accidents among them. The National Institutes of Health say that a part of the problem is that their brains just aren't ready for the risks of driving. Plus, they're just inexperienced, which leads to more crashes, rollovers, speeding, and driving off-road. And if you think it's bad when they're alone, it's even worse when they drive with their peers. A study from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center shows that the more passengers there are, the more accidents happen.\n\nStates have tried to make teens safer by putting restrictions on their licenses, like only letting them drive during certain hours and not with other minors. But these are just temporary fixes. The real problem is that teens, as a group, aren't ready to handle the responsibilities of driving. Even psychologist Marvin Zuckerman says 18 is too young. He's done research showing that teens under 19-20 love to take risks just for the thrill of it. So, we should delay driving until this urge starts to fade. If we don't, we'll see more accidents and the death toll could get way worse. By 2010, the younger Baby Boomers will be driving, and millions of new teen drivers will hit the road.\n\nLegislation could be simple. Schools could teach driving basics, but no one under 18 could drive. A permit could still be issued, but a certain number of practical training hours would be required, like the 6 hours behind the wheel and 50 hours with an adult that California requires. Since the problem affects teens across the nation, uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective solution. This idea isn't new, but it could really make a difference.",
            "So I decided to dive into the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, specifically looking at the fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films were known for their creative editing, which often created illusions. My focus in studying these films was to describe the poetic elements they used, particularly in the majority of trick films, and to explore the unique characteristics of a few later films. Most of these early trick films were bound to a set within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, relying on long and medium shots, and adhering to the one shot = one film approach. However, there were a few films at the start of the twentieth century that dared to break these rules by introducing multiple shots.\n\nOne thing these trick films share is that they were often filmed in an interior set, with the camera fixed in a frontal proscenium position. This was common in early films, taking inspiration from the theatre and vaudeville performances. The limitation of this approach was that figures in the films only moved side-to-side and didn't walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), actors entered from the right side and moved back and forth along the horizontal axis, without the camera following them.\n\nAnother commonality was the use of long and medium shots, with close-ups never being used. This style was taken from theatre and vaudeville traditions, where the audience saw the entire performance within the stage's borders. Actors didn't move towards the camera, so close-ups weren't used.\n\nMost of these early trick films followed the pattern of one conceptual shot equaling one film, which kept their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also limited their use in storytelling, focusing more on short vaudeville-style tricks. However, in trick films, one conceptual shot didn't equate to one physical shot. A single “shot” could actually be several joined together to create illusions of apparition or disappearance. For instance, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), a closer look reveals that the physical shot with Mary’s severed \"head\" begins, even though the film is conceptually one shot in the viewer's eyes.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republicanism. Although primarily an agriculturalist, his career in politics instilled in him a strong commitment to personal freedom and government, making him vocal on these matters. His dedication to an agrarian system shaped his views on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique chance to establish an ideal system, as there was no native tradition to obstruct the government's creation. He held strong convictions about the natural rights of man, which he thought were interdependent, meaning if one was denied, all would fail, and the value of what remained would be diminished. These rights, in his view, should be beyond the government's reach.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor thought a government must account for the inherent good and evil within people. He was firm in his dualistic morality, claiming, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He defined good principles as those that protected private property, improved agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. A government founded on these principles would function equitably, he believed, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by avarice and self-interest. He saw self-interest as a natural trait that only became evil when it led to the creation of sub-societies at the expense of others. A good government would retain man's natural evil but must be carefully watched to prevent the addition of bad principles.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, calling for an extremely limited Federal government with only the rights and powers explicitly stated in the Constitution. He understood that an extensive Federal government could be expensive and despotic, but he also believed a simple, literal interpretation was dangerous. Without considering the intent of the writers, it could easily become corrupt. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "So, referring back to Figure 17, we saw a noticeable drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of our project. It was somewhat disheartening, and it's tricky to pinpoint the exact cause. The onset of winter in New England means fewer people commute by bike or on foot, which could account for some of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester, when everyone is busy wrapping up schoolwork and grades. The commuter log might have just slipped off their radar. Additionally, the holiday season can take a toll, with a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, which might also contribute to the low log submissions for that month. However, none of this really explains the low February numbers. It's also possible that any project like this experiences an initial burst of excitement that naturally tapers off. To combat this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which did increase log submissions for that month. So one of the challenges we faced was maintaining project momentum despite these natural decreases and the holidays/semester breaks inherent in higher education.\n\nAnother challenge is the deeply ingrained culture of driving cars. People value the freedom, independence, and flexibility it provides. Thus, it's crucial to provide compelling incentives for alternative commuting. We handed out gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, an independent bookstore, and even some national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see if larger prizes like a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car could boost participation. The nature of the prizes didn't change throughout the project, but perhaps varying the value over time could have helped. The gift cards seemed sufficient at the start, but if we had announced additional bigger prizes in December and January, like bicycles and hybrid/electric cars, participation might have increased instead of decreasing.",
            "So, ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, are like securities that aim to mirror an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, but trade on exchanges like stocks. They offer the benefits of diversification, like index funds, plus the perks of single stock ownership, such as short selling, margin buying, and purchasing shares in any quantity. While these advantages are appealing, ETFs have costs just like mutual funds, with the added expense of trade commissions. One of the best things about ETFs is the wide variety of choices. However, it's always wise for investors to assess whether these claimed benefits, like diversification, truly exist and how significantly they impact performance. Let's dive into the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings to see if owning one ETF is as beneficial as owning a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks.\n\nFor simplicity, we'll only consider the top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF. Here they are:\n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF, we'll use their current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate their contributions to portfolio Beta and Return. The results are as follows:\n\nFrom the chart, it's clear that a portfolio of just the top ten holdings offers a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, a 16% boost, with a lower Beta of 0.12. It seems that a portfolio of these top ten stocks could provide better returns with less risk. However, we need to check if the means of these two portfolios are statistically different.\n\nTo determine this, we'll examine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, and compare their total standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "So, Edgar Allan Poe had this poem called \"Dream-Land,\" which he considered one of his better works. In this piece, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced back to Virgil. Virgil mentioned Thulé in his writings, describing it as an island north of Britain, marking the edge of the known world for the Greeks. While Virgil did use the term, there's a more recent source that Poe might have been influenced by: Goethe.\n\nThis connection is important because it shows Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" pointed out the similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, suggesting that Poe was likely emulating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a renowned writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe's death, 1832. Within the second part of Faust, there's a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. After her passing, he becomes consumed by grief and drinking, eventually deciding to end his life. He gives his possessions to his children, keeps the goblet, walks to a cliff, throws it into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies.\n\nThe king in \"The King of Thule\" and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, mirroring a dark doppelganger of Poe's loss and his drinking habit. The romantic drama based on Faust, created by H. P. Grattan in 1842, was published just a year before Poe's use of the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his collected works. He uses \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and in \"Dream-Land,\" using the term as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and haunted by dead friends, seeing a shaded world without color. These scenes echo the themes from \"The King of Thule,\" where the king is overcome with grief, loneliness, and a loss of will to live.\n\nGoethe was a notable author whom Poe would have known, not just for his connection to Tennyson but also because of the many reproductions of his work following the original publications.",
            "So under California law, let's break it down. Could a customer injured from slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store get punitive damages by proving the store manager acted with malice? Maybe. To make this case stick, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, would need to show that the manager, Paul Martin, was aware of the risk of harm and still chose to ignore it. She can point out that multiple previous incidents occurred due to unaddressed spills and that Martin knew this. His actions, such as not cleaning the spill while he was eating, could be seen as despicable, but less so than the fact that he ignored repeated requests to clean up. The judge is unlikely to dismiss her case outright, but it might face challenges in proving that Martin's actions were truly malicious and not just negligent.\n\nOn that fateful day, October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee alerted Martin about the applesauce spill, but he was on a dinner break and didn't want to deal with it. Another employee tried again at 5:15 pm, but Martin gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, resulting in a serious back injury. Palmer is now suing for damages, and we are considering whether to file a motion to dismiss part of her claim. To recover punitive damages in California, one must show the defendant acted with oppression, fraud, or malice. For malice, conduct must have been intended to cause harm or, if not intended, it must be despicable and committed with a willful disregard for others' rights. The judge might find that Martin's actions were maliciously indifferent to the safety of others, but this claim might be tough to prove.",
            "Well, almost four years back, I took a course on Islam over at CBC. One of the major points of contention in that class was the question of whether or not Islam is inherently hostile. Funny thing is, I think that debate's even more pertinent today than it was then. Looking back on the world since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the mass media's stance on Islam and extremists—from outright hostility to a near-worshipping tolerance. I mean, can you imagine, in 2001, having a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his clear Muslim roots?\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has always intrigued me. The more I've learned about his history, the more I'm struck by how his life doesn't quite match the image portrayed in the biography. From what I've known and studied before, I always thought Muhammad was the type to use force to convert people to Islam—conquering tribes and imposing his religion on them. But according to the biography, he's written as a sort of martyr, misunderstood and humbled. It's like, one by one, people started seeking him out. Huh, that's quite different from my previous understanding.\n\nThere are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad. The most notable one is the multiplication of mutton and milk to feed forty men. This style of storytelling makes me believe they were trying to elevate Muhammad to this humble, truth-living prophet who didn't need to prove his points through miracles. It's like they're stealing Jesus's thunder, making Muhammad seem like a basically perfect, Christ-like figure. That rubs me the wrong way.\n\nThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that seem to serve as some sort of proof of 'witnesses' converting to Islam on their own. Trouble is, these stories often come from third-party sources—like, \"So-and-so heard from this person who heard from that person.\" I don't like this because, while their intention might be to validate the stories through hearsay, it just makes the stories seem even more dubious.\n\nThe thing that bugs me the most is how they try to portray Muhammad as this godly, humble, endearing, and wise figure. History, however, tells a different story. It's like they're trying to whitewash Muhammad's rise to power. I can't help but think if Muslims today are aware of the real history behind their prophet.",
            "Well, the teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly forgotten when Christianity began to develop beyond his life. If we look at the big picture, Christianity seems to have been drifting farther and farther from its roots. Today's world shows a growing trend of progressive thinking, but tradition-holding individuals may not be enough to steer the whole. Among Christians, a deeper historical understanding will grow in the coming years. There will be a longing to distinguish the doctrines added to Christianity over time from the original intentions of its founder. This process may take decades or even centuries, but it's inevitable: Christianity will revert to its original form. A movement will emerge, peeling away layers of doctrine, like rewinding time, until only Jesus' original message remains. When this trend reaches the United States and Europe, it will influence many to worship as if they're living during Jesus' time, following only his ideas. The church will remain strong, leading the way, but the diversity of beliefs and practices will lessen, with similarities replacing differences among regions, denominations, and divisions. History is full of reversals. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire but later, the empire itself became Christian. Our country has seen African-American slavery turn into African-American leadership. The future of Christianity will follow this pattern, undoing history to find its source and reducing diversity. A vital part of this process will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. So, what has changed since Jesus' time?",
            "I hold that \"The Jungle\" reveals how at our core, humans are inherently greedy and selfish. Our chief concern is to make our own lives as comfortable and prosperous as possible, but we pay no heed to those beneath us. The novel illustrates this through the factory owners and managers who are solely focused on expanding their empires. They are unmoved by the harm caused by their operations, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" a vivid description of the environmental devastation. They show no concern for the workers or the animals who suffer due to the factories' emissions and waste. The owners' sole goal is profit, exemplified by their exploitation of employees: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They push workers to their limits, laying off mass numbers without notice or compensation. In that period, few laws or protections existed for workers, allowing managers to run rampant. The book suggests that those who perished in Packingtown were expected to endure the miserable conditions without aid or escape. Organizations to assist workers were scarce, and unions often exacerbated the plight of the workers by lining their pockets at the workers' expense. The workers were trapped in a system that treated them like slaves, as \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "Many authors employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or perspectives in their readers regarding important subjects. Some techniques work better than others. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald uses several of these methods. Often, he couples adjectives and nouns in unusual ways to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. Alternatively, he assigns meaning to symbols and then utilizes them for this purpose. Fitzgerald employs this latter technique with numerous colors, such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald constructs a particular significance for white/gray and red/pink colors, which he later employs to engender specific associations with significant subjects.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald assigns to white/gray is uniformity, with white symbolizing a higher social status and gray denoting older, faded elements. This is evident early in the novel, as characters are frequently depicted in white. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as “in white” (8), and even Nick wears “white flannels” (41) at Gatsby’s party. Only when Nick describes Gatsby’s party does he mention other colors, such as “gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald reinforces this association by coloring everyday subjects in white/gray. For instance, Nick’s work commute is described as “down the white chasms of lower New York” (56), and people’s names at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61) on his schedule. Furthermore, common or unimportant characters and places are often associated with white or gray. For example, Jordan and Daisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, and there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes. Similarly, the “Italian child” on the train is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is a “gray old man” (27).\n\nLater, Fitzgerald uses these colors to convey a sense of uniformity or unimportance around significant subjects, particularly through his portrayal of Daisy. After a prolonged period without notable mentions of either color, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in a “little white roadster,” making her seem less like a character and more like a mere addition to Gatsby’s pursuits (74). He further uses this technique to depict Daisy as a uniform addition, for example, with a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",
            "San Diego County, with its mild and sunny climate, is a hotspot for agriculture. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers are common crops. The demand for organic, community-supported agriculture is substantial, with many local organizations boasting long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also quite popular. Some organic farms offer tours of their operations and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This setup allows landowners to benefit from government programs while also enhancing habitat, offering recreational use, and generating income through tours and educational programs.",
            "Culture, it's a thing that's crucial in any negotiation. It's not just a single, uniform thing, but it's made up of what it isn't and what it stands for too. It's not all the same everywhere, and it's not a static thing either. So saying things like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is too broad. It's better to understand how the culture of the people you're dealing with affects the negotiation, especially if you're from a different culture. When you're dealing with a foreign culture, you'll naturally compare it to your own, but that's okay. Understanding a culture involves more than just learning its history, it's about understanding its prejudices too. Instead of judging or trying to change them, you just need to accept them and work within their boundaries, especially if you're at a disadvantage in the negotiation. If you're on \"home turf,\" respecting their traditions and beliefs can help you get past any cultural barriers and move things forward.\n\nCulture isn't just about national or international differences. Even within the same country, companies can have their own unique cultures. For example, some companies might emphasize long hours, while others might have a more relaxed schedule. You can see these differences in things like employee dress codes, how they communicate, and how they hire people. Some companies encourage philanthropy at all levels, while others only do it through \"company approved\" charities. Just look at American corporate culture to see how diverse it is. Even within a single company, there can be different cultures based on location or environment. Some cultures may seem more uniform, but that's just the surface. You need to look deeper to understand them.\n\nValues are key because they tell you why a culture is the way it is. If saving face or communal harmony is important, a negotiator won't publicly humiliate their company or their boss to win. Likewise, if a negotiator comes from a culture that favors tough bargaining, they won't rush to settle early. Understanding these generalities before the negotiation is important, but it's also good to know something about your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "So the fool in his heart once proclaimed, \"There is no God.\" This notion is first seen in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and also stands at the center of St. Anselm’s argument for God's existence. This view is also echoed by another author we'll discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Since both arguments are aimed at proving the same divine entity, specifically the God of the Bible, let's start by assuming they are both correct in their belief. To compare their arguments effectively, we must assume they are discussing the same God. So, while each of them offers valid points, neither presents a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nSt. Anselm’s approach begins with faith, emphasizing that understanding God requires looking within oneself. He argues that since God exists within our minds, we cannot imagine his nonexistence. This idea, while somewhat complicated, posits that proof of God's existence lies within our own consciousness. St. Anselm suggests we don't need external evidence to find truth about God; it's inherently within our minds. This is often referred to as faith in Christian teachings.\n\nThomas Aquinas, however, takes a different stance. He believes God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without needing faith. This argument is advantageous for evangelism, as it can persuade converts without relying on their willingness to accept unprovable faith. St. Thomas presents five logical arguments to support his claim: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument demonstrates that the need for God is logically necessary, even without direct observation.\n\nIn essence, Aquinas argues that logical deductions can prove God's existence, much like knowing a missing puzzle piece's features without seeing it.",
            "Long ago, around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned the world and achieved enlightenment, giving birth to the teachings that would become Buddhism, with its most traditional branch being known as Theravada Buddhism. This religion has been around for about 2500 years, and it has evolved significantly since Buddha's time. You can see these changes in various places, such as in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where an annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Monks and laypeople alike participate in this event, which has some religious significance, even though Buddha never taught about such a festivity.\n\nThe changes in Buddhism over time can be seen in both its superficial traditions and its core beliefs. The Theravada Buddhist community, whether from a monastic or lay perspective, has had to adjust its doctrinal principles over the years due to both internal and external factors, as well as hostile and benign influences. To better understand this discussion, let's define some key terms. Internal forces refer to influences coming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of one's status, while external forces refer to influences from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are any that aim to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often stemming from negative perceptions of Buddhism. Benign forces, on the other hand, do not intend to harm or help the community but may do so indirectly.\n\nTo delve into the basics of Theravada Buddhism, we must first explore its core doctrinal principles. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the metaphysical components of Buddhism, such as Anatta (no self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). By recognizing these concepts, one can escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and along with it, lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), ultimately achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets rules for life, with laypeople following five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances), while monks follow many more disciplinary rules. The fundamental doctrine in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: first, that life is suffering (Dukkha); second, that attachment is the cause of suffering; third, that suffering can be overcome; and fourth, the path to the end of suffering.",
            "So, let me tell you a story about two nations, the United States of America and Mexico. They had a long-standing rivalry that lasted for a whopping 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the U.S. attacked and conquered Mexico, gaining Texas and the American Southwest as new territory. There were many other skirmishes between them, which finally softened just before the First World War.\n\nTheir rivalry started over key issues like religion, culture, and tradition, with a significant clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31). It's not unlike many other nations that have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor; nations sharing a border often have conflicting interests, leading to rivalries. The U.S. and Mexico are no different. David M. Pletcher (1977) put it this way, “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).\n\nReligious differences were a huge rift between them, similar to many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) stated, “if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy” (p.86). This ideological struggle was not about political structure but religious preferences. The distrust between the United States and Mexico stemmed from the distrust between the English and Spanish, which was passed down from their colonial rulers. This lingering mistrust made it difficult to establish friendly foreign relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) listed 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes were about territorial issues, like border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a significant issue that persisted until both nations used military force to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) noted that the rivalry began to ease as Mexico became highly dependent on the United States, and it finally ended when American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico (p. 109-110) in the latter part of the 19th Century.",
            "Well, it's been a long time since I was struck with a sudden and unforeseen disability, around 15 years ago. I was working as a nurse, a job I chose for a sense of security and safety that I lacked during my childhood. I kept hearing that people would always get sick, so I figured nursing was a safe bet. Even though my heart yearned for a career in science or journalism, the security of a consistent job was too appealing to pass up.\n\nBut life had other plans. At 46, I found myself unable to work, my body broken by an illness I never saw coming. My savings were dwindling, and after 15 long years of relying on Social Security Disability, I have little left to call my own. Every day is a struggle, a constant assault on my security and self-esteem. I am reminded daily that nothing in life is certain, yet I know I've made it this far only because of the support of my family and a few good friends. Alone, I'd be lost.\n\nMy message is clear: life is unpredictable. There will always be challenges, and no amount of preparation can shield you from everything. Sure, we should be wise and self-reliant, but the American spirit was not built on rugged individualism alone. It was built on compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. People didn't conquer the Rockies by going it alone; they did it together.\n\nSo, while I have a disaster kit and supplies, I also encourage you to build relationships with your neighbors. Trust, compassion, and mutual aid are the foundations of any strong community. Let's learn to help each other and ask for help when we need it, rather than isolating ourselves. After all, no one can go it alone forever.",
            "Why do organisms evolve the way they do? Are there limitations or factors that influence the trajectory of evolutionary change? While D’Arcy Thompson in 1917 said, “Even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,” the same can be said today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny, as seen in studies like Raup and Stanley's work in 1981. Our research explores how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, in conjunction with experimental studies, can help understand the mechanisms behind the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. Using X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies with software like CerioShell. These models help interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum, and the results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better grasp macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that extends over time through 360 degrees of space. These turns in the shell's spiral are called whorls, which revolve around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which whorls enlarge can vary, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl, called the body whorl, is the last one. The spire is the part of the shell without the body whorl, with the apex at the top and the base at the bottom. The animal's exit from the shell is through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles—apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, first, view the shell from the apical side to locate the first suture, then draw a line dividing the shell. Count whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and the horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formula is established, parameters can be varied and modified to alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "For the past decade, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have remained quite stable. Although the country has made progress towards many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the progress on child and maternal health indicators is lagging considerably, making it challenging to achieve the 2015 targets. The reasons for these shortcomings are multifaceted and suggest that strengthening the overall health system is a more pressing need than focusing on specific programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% of births now meeting this standard. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions during complicated pregnancies, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate due to hemorrhage. This indicates that while progress has been made, there is still significant work to be done in this area. Additionally, there has been a decrease in the percentage of diarrhea cases in children under five years treated by a healthcare professional, and postnatal care remains a concern with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain relatively low at around 4%, with only 2% in rural areas compared to 7% in urban areas. This highlights a severe issue of healthcare access disparity across the country, with services concentrated in urban areas. Furthermore, there is a significant gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, with a 27% difference, indicating that the poor have greater difficulty accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal health indicators, the primary question is how best to address the lack of service. Should Indonesia focus on developing program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without concentrating on pre- and post-pregnancy care? While programmatic approaches offer targeted and manageable objectives with faster results, they also come with significant drawbacks. Investing heavily in one area can lead to insufficient funding for other sectors and may result in human resources being drawn to better-resourced programs. Running multiple parallel programs without coordination can also lead to duplication of services and increased administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their intricate detail and focus on the aristocracy of the era. Two notable Victorian works that break from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels incorporate an element of mystery and an unconventional twist, which enriches their characters and deepens our understanding of their motivations and emotions. In Oliver Twist, for instance, such elements are often revealed through dream sequences or dreamlike states. These strange occurrences often shed light on Oliver’s inner turmoil, his awareness of his surroundings, and the true nature of events around him. When Oliver revisits the shooting of himself in chapter 28, he experiences it as if in a dream, grappling to find help. The passage emphasizes Oliver’s lack of control over the unfolding events and the dire state of his health, evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself numbs all his senses, and he doesn’t notice the “unseen hand” that carries him away. He relives his despair removed from the initial shock of pain, now constant and linked with fear. This shooting underscores Oliver’s inability to take control of his circumstances, even when his life is at stake. It suggests a growing sense of defeat, as if Fagin has broken him, forcing him to accept his despair and influencing his ability to react. It is implied that Oliver would have made some effort to save his life had he not been overwhelmed by his circumstances.",
            "A couple of years back, I was part of an after-school program where I tutored elementary age students. I did my best to assist them in any subjects they were struggling with, but my strengths lay in English and reading. One particular student, Adrian, needed help with reading and it quickly became apparent that something wasn't right. He could read perfectly, but he had peculiar difficulties with certain letters. It didn't make sense; he spoke perfect English, but the problem was that he didn't know the English alphabet well. One day, his mother arrived. She spoke only Spanish, and even with my limited Spanish, we managed to communicate. That's when I realized Adrian's issue; he could read, but he didn't know the English alphabet. I'm not sure if that revelation helped him, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the challenge of language barriers in schools, especially in California. It shows that even when a child speaks perfect English, reading can still be a hurdle. I believe we all agree this is an issue, so what can we do about it? For Adrian, the solution was straightforward: he needed tutoring in English reading, especially the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none of these alone can solve the problem. The key is to combine all these methods!\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a great idea, not just for Spanish-speaking children, but for all kids. Studies show that children in these programs outperform their peers academically. However, there's a lot of fear surrounding this idea, that it's a waste of resources. That's not true. If we implemented these programs in all classrooms, all children would benefit. How do we do it? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic. But we can certainly have bilingual aids or tutors to assist.",
            "From the time we are kids, we're often told there's something larger than ourselves, something we can't comprehend. Some of us are taught about it in Sunday school, others in temples, or we look within ourselves for answers. Many of us just accept what our parents believed, while some reject it and believe in nothing beyond our own egocentric universe. We may adopt one value system, then change our minds later. Whatever path we choose, we define a part of ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives. We seek a light to guide us out of the darkness and into the sun.\n\n\"Cardinals,\" my dad said when I asked him about his favorite bird. We were sitting on the porch, listening to the rain, smoking our cigarettes. The gutters overflowed, drowning the plants at the edge. He seemed distant, thinner, and his hair was sparse. He stared at the rain, not meeting my eyes. I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk about how much I'd miss him. I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and watched the rain with him.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation didn't ease his suffering, but kept him alive a few months longer. I couldn't watch him leave this life. I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. I curled up and waited for the news.\n\nNo one called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in essence, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt puts it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both criticized and celebrated, accused of lacking depth and praised for its 'terrible sublime' effect (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined ideas from \"ancient and modern\" romances to establish the Gothic genre and a new mode of literary expression. Walpole used \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to create what he termed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre incorporates numerous throwbacks to medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. When The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated. The blend of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing for a more personal view of characters' psychology) has kept Gothic relevant for centuries, making it both obsolete and fresh for readers far removed from its original period.\n\nOne prominent Gothic theme found in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is crucial to Gothic writers because it represents the classic knight—brave, honorable, and competent—while also highlighting their perceived lack of these qualities in contemporary society. By employing chivalric concepts and mannerisms, the \"Gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the genre's future evolution into Romanticism. Walpole, writing during a politically tumultuous period and grappling with unfair accusations, may have begun to question the morality and innate \"goodness\" of people, as compared to the supposed ideals of the Gothic era. This notion is evident in several characters, including Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, the reader learns that he embodies many chivalric traits. He is described as:\n\nThe description includes numerous traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently thought to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course, exaggerated, bringing into play the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",

            "Duke Ellington's impact in jazz music is largely due to his longevity and the creative prowess he brought to his orchestra. His presence on the piano, while subtle in many compositions, showcases his ability to craft rich and intricate pieces that highlight the unique talents of his band members. Ellington designed a framework that allowed for soloists to freely improvise, while also writing tightly orchestrated sections that emphasized the individual styles of his musicians, creating harmonious and original sounds for each piece. His mastery of each player's sound, along with how they blended together in a growing ensemble, allowed him to compose some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's sound and innovation, mentioning his use of voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This is evident in his early piece, Creole Love Call, where Ellington uses voice to add texture and color without lyrics. Here, the voice complements the styles of his soloists, a trait that persists throughout his career. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses, each with a unique call and response between voice and reeds, showcasing Ellington's ability to create a rich tapestry of sound.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a complementary sound. This piece, like many of Ellington’s works, showcases his ability to blend different musical styles and instruments seamlessly. In It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing), Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's unique sound on muted trombone to great effect in introducing the melody.\n\nEllington’s use of voice to add a layer of tone color to his pieces is just one example of his stylistic brilliance that runs throughout his career.",

            "Well, 2007 was a year when the United States of America was hit by a severe financial crisis. Unemployment soared, the housing market collapsed, and many of the nation's major corporations were left in shambles. This economic downturn is still ongoing today, so we must ask: how did this crisis come about, and how can we prevent it from happening again? In essence, the financial crisis was caused by self-centered and naive political decisions that pushed banks and firms to offer sub-prime loans, which were sold to an immature and underdeveloped financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to back and package these mortgages into CDOs and CDS'. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks found themselves short on capital reserves and transferred this turmoil to the repacked mortgages they had sold, and eventually to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe origins of this financial crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration. The President was aiming for a second term and sought to boost his popularity, which led to the relaxation of lending restrictions. This paved the way for the sub-prime crisis just seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999 reported, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest mortgage underwriter, faced increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income people, while also feeling pressure from shareholders to maintain its remarkable growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: \"However, the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, necessitating a government rescue similar to that of the Savings and Loan industry in the 1980s.\" As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foretold, imprudent lending would indeed lead to the economy’s collapse.\n\nSeveral factors combined to push the economy into a tailspin, with one being the complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs were widely used in the years before the crisis, further intertwining various economic sectors with the housing market. This overleveraged the U.S. households and financial markets in the housing sector, leaving them highly susceptible to even minor price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which represented about 30% of the USA's GDP. Eventually, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to stringent regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your tale where you flex your writer's muscles and soar, dazzling your readers with your enchanting prose.

Dr. Merlin herself has caught herself shouting at her screen when she's wading through Too Much Information, and not in the interesting way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still finds herself tripping over long passages where nothing substantial occurs, or worse, too much detail. Exposition is that little imp on your shoulder telling you to rush through the history to get to the good stuff (not to be confused with the imp on the other shoulder pushing to tell your audience every last detail of your characters' backstories).\n\nExposition means laying out what happened, typically in straightforward language. In film, the exposition happens when one character shares a laundry list of information with another, like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the sharing.\n\nConsider this: while reading a story, you're told something like, \"The heroine met her beloved at such a time and place, they were wed in a grand event, and he was murdered in front of her eyes.\" You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to consume two pages, during which both characters exchange only a couple of lines. You'd expect the author to spend time on the husband's character, revealing through his dialogue and actions how deeply he loved his wife, and you'd likewise expect the heroine to show through both big and small ways how his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story later says her love was profound). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to feel his loss as she does and would give you insight into the heroine's life: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so on. You'd mourn his death with her, and so grow more invested in the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you need to provide the substance that brings the story to life.

            "Yesterday, I caught two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, aired live on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011), discussed a disturbing incident in Ashley, Ohio. The story involved a man named Shad Hostettler who had stabbed his wife; they didn't mention her name, but the mug shot they showed looked chilling. They dedicated only about two minutes to the developing story, which, I believe, was appropriate. The second story, featuring an early morning shooting in Sharon Woods, involved Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old who had been critically injured. There were no arrests at the time, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story was brief, and I suspect that might have been due to the fact that it involved a person of color. I've noticed over the years that crimes against minorities often don't receive as much attention as they deserve. The next story was about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, which was believed to have been caused by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. Following that, they reported on the predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. This segment was brief, but it served as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in. They also covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, where a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt had been involved. They devoted an unusual amount of time to emphasize his race and the fact that he was tall and weighed around 150 pounds. Lastly, they mentioned a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin named Rene Rodriguez, who had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. They also noted his Hispanic background, which, in my opinion, was not relevant to the story.",
            "The bond between brothers is a unique and unyielding connection, filled with a myriad of emotions—love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty among others. Brothers understand each other in a way no one else can, and they often see their own reflection in their sibling. This bond is most apparent in dire situations, where its true nature emerges, be it for better or worse. The emotions that form from this fraternal link come with a significant price. Understanding these emotions means also accepting the consequences they bring. When you look into your brother's eyes, you see yourself as you truly are, not as others perceive you. It is in their actions and the aftermath of those actions that their genuine character is revealed. This theme is vividly explored in “The Scarlet Ibis,” where two brothers embark on a doomed journey, navigating through a lush landscape. The story is rich with Doodle's direct characterization and his interactions with his older brother, as well as with the narrator's perspective, which provides insight into the complex emotions and actions of both characters.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single emotion: pride. From the time he first goes out with Doodle to their final, tragic excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his younger brother. He yearned for a companion he could teach all his skills, such as holding his breath, running, and climbing trees, as well as someone to race with and perch with in the tallest pine. However, Doodle's frail heart made it unlikely he would ever participate in such activities. This placed a heavy burden on the protagonist, whose dreams were dashed in an instant. This realization even led him to contemplate harming Doodle, illustrating the depth of his resentment. Yet, his heart softened when Doodle simply smiled at him, showing that his initial intentions were not truly evil. The smile gave the protagonist hope, highlighting his underlying love for his brother, despite his initial resentment.",
            "The human brain, an intricate and imaginative information processor, has seen its metaphors evolve with technological progress. From a wax tablet to a computer, these metaphors help us understand the brain but can also lead to misconceptions. Information begins as sensory inputs, transforming physical stimuli like touch, warmth, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. These signals are processed through algorithms, both bottom-up and top-down. For instance, when you see a black box on white paper, bottom-up processing combines simple details like color and edge borders to recognize it as a box. Top-down processing then speeds up your recognition by using prior decisions. The brain's attention filter sorts information's importance, deciding which cognitive processes to prioritize. For example, while walking, you might notice your name in a noisy room, ignoring individual blades of grass. This processing involves multiple stages, modulated by attention.\n\nInformation storage is crucial for the brain. There are various types of memory, such as sensory, working, and long-term. Encoding involves converting sensory inputs into different types of information, like structural, phonetic, or semantic. Working memory, with a brief storage period, is maintained by electrical signals looping through specific neurons. Long-term memory is believed to rely on specific protein structures. Multiple models organize knowledge in the brain, ranging from human memory retrieval to computer science and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes nodes representing concepts linked by their relatedness, such as \"chair\" linked to \"table\" and \"wooden\"",
            "Aldous Huxley voices concern over the looming threat of technology and capitalistic systems, creating a dystopian society in Brave New World. The citizenry prioritizes community over individualism and is conditioned from birth to chase happiness at all costs. They are pawns in a larger scheme controlled by the World Controller, who dictates their ideology. Examining the novel through a Marxist lens reveals Huxley's skepticism about these emerging systems, using terms like homogenization and reification to highlight its flaws.\n\nCapitalism is critiqued through the concept of false consciousness. The common folks are kept unaware of their true economic relations, focusing instead on self-interest. This is achieved through the proletariat's ideological control, evident in Brave New World's conditioning. The common classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, lack free will and are driven to consume and indulge. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where social classes are dominated by a separate group, is clear. The lower classes are unaware of manipulation, being \"sold on an ideology that upholds the structure\" (capitalism and consumerism). Even the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, accept their status, with few exceptions like Bernard. The societal interactions reveal the oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships are shallow. Characters lack depth, even among major figures. Huxley might suggest that technology and capitalism rob individuals of free will and expression. Love doesn't exist, nor intense emotions; interactions are superficial. Males comment on females' physical appearance, and females discuss their encounters casually. Each societal class' complacency with their role indicates capitalism's socioeconomic effects. Their unquestioning obedience signifies Marxist thought, where the proletariat are made to believe they are superior as long as they consume and adhere to their peers.",
            "Well, I've been hanging out at University Park for nearly two and a half years now, which adds up to four semesters. Navigating the campus can be a real pain, especially for freshmen. My first year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, pretty much at the farthest point east on campus. Just getting to classes in places like Willard building could take up to 25 minutes on foot, and that's not counting the bad weather we usually get in State College. Turns out, not too long ago, East Halls were isolated from the rest of the campus by vast empty spaces. Now, those have been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services center, and apartments. As campus keeps growing, it's getting harder to get around. So, what's the best solution to the campus commute conundrum? Bikes are the way to go.\n\nMy buddy just started riding again after a long break, and he's loving it. “Bikes are awesome,” he says, “they're the only way to get around.” Besides being good for your body, they're the most efficient mode of transport. A bowl of oats and a little workout can cover 30 miles no problem. I, too, live off campus, about as far from the center as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was getting a bike. Thomas building, where I have class every day, is a 25-minute walk from my place. On my bike, that time cuts to 5 minutes. The only downside is Pollock Road, the fastest route to Thomas, isn't always a smooth ride. Still, walking takes too much time, especially when you're as busy as I am. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option. Walking to Thomas would add 30-40 minutes each day, and that's over two and a half hours a week. Let's not forget the extra time for other classes, appointments, and so on. That's a lot of time I can't spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In my pursuit of a career in social work, I aspire to join the Division of Family and Children Services to assist youngsters who have endured abuse or neglect; and to offer support to distressed families. The values I bring to the social work field are: service, respect, ethical integrity, a commitment to fostering healthier relationships, and a dedication to personal growth to remain proficient in my career. These core values are significant not only to social workers but also to me personally.\n\nI've always yearned to lend a helping hand, though I was uncertain about the right career path. Throughout my high school and college years, I observed many individuals shun their problems in denial, employing coping strategies that were less than optimal. Witnessing such situations, I decided to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Post-graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break. One summer, visiting a friend, I met a sixteen-year-old boy nervously sitting on her couch. Learning he had fled his abusive parents, I drove to his home to offer help. The police, unable to intervene further, asked me to speak with his parents. They seemed defensive and blamed his \"manipulative\" behavior for involving outsiders. This encounter convinced me to consider social work to aid children in family disputes.\n\nAnother vital aspect for social work is social justice. Our society claims to value individuality but often mourns lost souls while pushing everyone to conform to archaic norms. I don't adhere to such limitations and have consistently protested against social injustices. In high school and college, I expressed my individuality through unconventional hairstyles, attire, and piercings, joined GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and stood against racism and discrimination. I uphold social justice and will continue to fight against it.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to insomnia. The Biological model delves into genetic factors and medical aspects of sleep health, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental relationships and their influence on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models and chooses specific studies to illustrate and enhance our understanding of them. Each study's findings and explanations are then critically evaluated to highlight their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, those linked to other mental disorders, and those related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders like Dyssomnias and Parasomnias are standalone issues, while those related to mental disorders can be associated with Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). Other sleep disorders may result from medical complications or substance use. Key Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia (difficulty in adequate or maintained sleep), Primary Hypersomnia (difficulty staying awake for at least a month), Narcolepsy (cataplexy and/or automatic REM episodes), Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Parasomnias involve behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. This review primarily focuses on insomnia and touches on primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders centers around genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects. Orexin neurons in the hypothalamus regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice found that Phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons control sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. A GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in the study, suggesting the findings can be generalized to humans. This implies that genetic and environmental factors influence the functioning of the GABAB receptor in humans, affecting sleep without medication. If the receptor is altered, it can disrupt sleep, impacting aspects of life like school, career, and daily tasks requiring focus.",
            "So, this paper delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it provides a simple definition of the disorder. Following that, it explains how CAPD is diagnosed, highlighting common symptoms, or so-called \"red flags\". Lastly, it offers tips for how a teacher in a mainstream classroom can assist a student with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is essentially how efficiently the central nervous system (CNS) processes and uses auditory information. In other words, it's a condition where the brain fails to properly interpret sounds. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally but may struggle with separating words or differentiating conversations from background noise, making them appear as if they have hearing difficulties, although they don't.\n\nThe earliest known mention of this disorder was in the mid-1950s, when it was called \"auditory imperception\". Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began testing children with communication issues in 1954, and Canadian researcher Kimura later introduced dichotic testing in 1961. These developments sparked further research in the field.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: a person might struggle to pinpoint where sound is coming from, differentiate between multiple sounds, recognize sound patterns, detect changes in speech (like sarcasm), be distracted by subsequent sounds, or interpret the sequence of sounds correctly. Diagnosing CAPD involves observing the patient's listening behavior and performance on specific auditory function tests, conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, or others. There isn't a single, foolproof test for CAPD, nor is there a known cause for the disorder. Tests often present patients with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask them to identify specific items, like words or numbers. Advanced tests might involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "In \"Twelfth Night,\" it seems that while disguises can be handy for lengthy deceptions, ultimately, one must discard their masquerade to avoid losing their true self. The challenge with revealing a deception, though, is the potential for alienation from those around you. Some might remain unaffected, but others may take offense at being tricked.\n\nThe theme of gender disguise is complicated. It raises questions about why someone would adopt an opposite-gender identity. For Viola, it's a form of self-preservation: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249) Arriving in a new land, she feels the need to impersonate a man to protect herself. Her plan succeeds, but it isolates her from women, cutting her off from important support. She also faces issues with her romantic feelings for Sebastian/Orsino and Olivia's infatuation with Cesario/Viola: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\n\nHowever, this could be seen as a progressive outlook, showing how deception can expose hidden emotions. In Olivia and Orsino's case, it appears their subconscious desires are stirred by Cesario's presence. Is Olivia attracted to Cesario because he's a man, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? It's likely the former, as Olivia seems to change her affections quickly, switching from Cesario to Sebastian and considering Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "German colonial rule has been widely recognized for its harshness, particularly in the case of the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa. It's important to note that describing the entire German colonial empire through such a simple lens is impossible. The empire's policies and governance style varied greatly across its extensive territory. Educational initiatives were just as varied. For instance, when the British took over German East Africa (now Tanzania), they discovered a considerable number of educated and literate Africans. Similarly, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporary authors. However, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) was quite different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government played a significant role in educating the natives, in South West Africa, the education of locals was largely left to missionary societies who received minimal government support. The government did, however, invest substantially in the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies had numerous literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the overwhelming majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper aims to explore these factors and delve into new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\nThere's a plethora of literature on education in the German colonial empire, much of it written in German in the early 20th century, during or shortly after German rule. These early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems of the colonies. Later English-language works expanded on this by conducting comparative studies across the German colonies and offering more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in educational systems among the colonies. Cohen’s study on education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly notable. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and discusses the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa explains many of the distinctive features of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately pleasant climate, with much of the territory covered by arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913, there were nearly 15,000 whites in South West Africa, compared to just 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "Another decade has passed, with the evolution of popular music's classification reaching an unprecedented extent. The once broad spectrum of genres has now expanded to encompass so many sub-genres that it's practically impossible to enumerate them all. This is further complicated by the fact that even the most prominent genres, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres within their respective domains. Within this vast landscape, the sub-genre of heavy metal rock stands out as one of the most versatile and expressive genres of popular music over the past 40 years. It is expressive because it delves deeply into a wide array of emotions, often favoring the darker aspects of human experience. Its diversity lies in the early recognition of its flexibility, which allowed musicians to create their own sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, continuing this trend to the present day.\n\nToday, the heavy metal scene is so fragmented that identifying what constitutes heavy metal can be challenging. It has absorbed elements from various genres, yet it has its roots in something authentic. To truly grasp the metal music we encounter today, one must first understand the essence of the metal movement and why it transcends mere genre classification.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement rooted in darkness. It is a music of extremes—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. There is less simplicity, more skill. Musicians in metal bands are highly proficient, and this expertise is evident in their music. Metal is also intrinsically linked to the drug culture of the mid-70s, where psychedelic drugs fueled the creation of otherworldly records. It embodies dark, visceral qualities that were relatively uncharted territory in the music scene, where the darker emotional spectrum was often overlooked. Furthermore, later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prominent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following exemplify the darkness that permeates the movement:",
            "Way before the Surrealists were splashing dreamy colors onto canvas, Henri Rousseau was busy crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is a masterclass in his personal aspirations and internal tug-of-war. On one hand, he yearned for acceptance, recognition, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts. On the other hand, he struggled with whether to conform to established painting styles or forge his own path. The Dream encapsulates this lifelong conflict.\n\nTo truly grasp the significance of The Dream, let's first delve a bit into Rousseau's life. Born in Laval, northwest France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau didn't have much formal art training. Instead, he worked as a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, until the age of forty. Despite his plain circumstances, he dreamt of a new life through painting, offering solace after the tragedies of his first wife's and eight infant children's deaths. Unlike his peers, who romanticized peasants in their art, Rousseau remained a folk painter, reflecting the hopes and dreams of the average citizen.\n\nRousseau’s desire for acceptance was understandable given his situation. He started his artistic journey late and in the shadow of many renowned artists. He only began to gain recognition around the time Matisse was building his reputation. Jan Gordon in Modern French Painters notes that while both artists competed in the art world, their motivations were different. Matisse sought to paint unconventionally to avoid clichés, while Rousseau aimed to paint conventionally to be accepted by the Artiste Français (92).",
            "Many a great philosopher has pondered the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics. I believe this is because the essence of both lies in something ineffable. As John Keats put it in his famous \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty — That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While we often learn about ethics and aesthetics through education and experience, our appreciation of them seems to come naturally. Ethics and aesthetics, you see, are not about prescribing rules, but rather trying to understand why something is moral or beautiful. We grapple with the intricacies of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, talking about elements like contrast and cultural context, but in the end, the true reason behind its beauty eludes us. It's often that intangible \"something\" that makes us appreciate a piece of art or literature. This je ne sais quoi is what makes art and morality so powerful, and it's this transcendental nature that binds them together.\n\nWe experience both ethics and aesthetics at a deep, almost mystical level, a place where we can feel them but not entirely explain them. This is especially true of literature's moral quality, as McKean suggests. He notes that, unlike other arts like music, literature is uniquely tied to our moral lives because it reflects the values we hold dear. This moral quality is why literature is so important to us, and why ethics and aesthetics are so closely intertwined.",
            "Germany today stands as a mighty nation, its unique culture stretching from the alpine peaks of München to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This blend can be felt along the Rhine in Köln, through the heart of Germany, and into the Elbe Valley in Dresden. Given this diverse culture, it's not surprising that Germany, as we know it, is a fusion of various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a name with uncertain origins. Some scholars believe it came from the Germanic Tribe known as the Tungrians, who were later called Germans. Others think it might be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" suggesting loud or noisy people. Tacitus, in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98, describes the Germans as aboriginal and not intermingled with other races. He notes that no one would choose to leave the comforts of Rome for the harsh lands of Germania, unless it was their home. The Romans, while sending out expeditions to trade and conquer, mostly returned to their empire. This led to the Germanic tribes residing on the empire's borders, trading goods and skills, and sometimes serving in the Roman army.",
            "I stood there, staring down at the view in front of me, my mind blank like a canvas awaiting inspiration. Unemotionally, silently, I observed the picture before me, my practiced awareness taking it all in but refusing to connect it to any abstract idea. Thoughts flowed in and out of my mind so quickly, it was as if I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and fluid experience of what I was seeing. Once, an artist I'd worked with suggested I buy a book called 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain'. I'd been wanting to learn to draw since I was six, and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to how the brain interprets lines. One of the techniques it teaches is to place a square frame around any picture you want to study, turning a complex scene into a simple one. At the time, I couldn't quite mentally project that artist's frame. I was too overwhelmed, too awestruck to do anything but stand and gaze in wonderment. Picasso's blue phase, Monet's love for greenery, the Italian Renaissance masters' vibrant colors - if I had any artistic pretensions, here was where my picture began, my story started, 'Work in Brown'.\n\nMy hand touched the handle of my chosen tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as I guided it through space, my mind's will taking shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Pieces of matter broke away and were carried away to nothingness. But the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet with more urgency. The offensive brown package just wouldn't budge, stuck like a slug on the toilet's bottom. I stood there, a mop in hand, feet set a foot apart, a green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat. I frowned, staring at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more quiet moments to myself, and then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the end of the toilet paper, and began to wrap itself around and around like an oven mitt. Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "So another month has gone by, and of course, my life is pretty much the same old thing. Not much happened, except for the usual stuff. I've been thinking about teen drivers and the alarming rates of fatal accidents among them. The National Institutes of Health say that a part of the problem is that their brains just aren't ready for the risks of driving. Plus, they're just inexperienced, which leads to more crashes, rollovers, speeding, and driving off-road. And if you think it's bad when they're alone, it's even worse when they drive with their peers. A study from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center shows that the more passengers there are, the more accidents happen.\n\nStates have tried to make teens safer by putting restrictions on their licenses, like only letting them drive during certain hours and not with other minors. But these are just temporary fixes. The real problem is that teens, as a group, aren't ready to handle the responsibilities of driving. Even psychologist Marvin Zuckerman says 18 is too young. He's done research showing that teens under 19-20 love to take risks just for the thrill of it. So, we should delay driving until this urge starts to fade. If we don't, we'll see more accidents and the death toll could get way worse. By 2010, the younger Baby Boomers will be driving, and millions of new teen drivers will hit the road.\n\nLegislation could be simple. Schools could teach driving basics, but no one under 18 could drive. A permit could still be issued, but a certain number of practical training hours would be required, like the 6 hours behind the wheel and 50 hours with an adult that California requires. Since the problem affects teens across the nation, uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective solution. This idea isn't new, but it could really make a difference.",
            "So I decided to dive into the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, specifically looking at the fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films were known for their creative editing, which often created illusions. My focus in studying these films was to describe the poetic elements they used, particularly in the majority of trick films, and to explore the unique characteristics of a few later films. Most of these early trick films were bound to a set within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, relying on long and medium shots, and adhering to the one shot = one film approach. However, there were a few films at the start of the twentieth century that dared to break these rules by introducing multiple shots.\n\nOne thing these trick films share is that they were often filmed in an interior set, with the camera fixed in a frontal proscenium position. This was common in early films, taking inspiration from the theatre and vaudeville performances. The limitation of this approach was that figures in the films only moved side-to-side and didn't walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), actors entered from the right side and moved back and forth along the horizontal axis, without the camera following them.\n\nAnother commonality was the use of long and medium shots, with close-ups never being used. This style was taken from theatre and vaudeville traditions, where the audience saw the entire performance within the stage's borders. Actors didn't move towards the camera, so close-ups weren't used.\n\nMost of these early trick films followed the pattern of one conceptual shot equaling one film, which kept their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also limited their use in storytelling, focusing more on short vaudeville-style tricks. However, in trick films, one conceptual shot didn't equate to one physical shot. A single “shot” could actually be several joined together to create illusions of apparition or disappearance. For instance, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), a closer look reveals that the physical shot with Mary’s severed \"head\" begins, even though the film is conceptually one shot in the viewer's eyes.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republicanism. Although primarily an agriculturalist, his career in politics instilled in him a strong commitment to personal freedom and government, making him vocal on these matters. His dedication to an agrarian system shaped his views on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique chance to establish an ideal system, as there was no native tradition to obstruct the government's creation. He held strong convictions about the natural rights of man, which he thought were interdependent, meaning if one was denied, all would fail, and the value of what remained would be diminished. These rights, in his view, should be beyond the government's reach.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor thought a government must account for the inherent good and evil within people. He was firm in his dualistic morality, claiming, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He defined good principles as those that protected private property, improved agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. A government founded on these principles would function equitably, he believed, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by avarice and self-interest. He saw self-interest as a natural trait that only became evil when it led to the creation of sub-societies at the expense of others. A good government would retain man's natural evil but must be carefully watched to prevent the addition of bad principles.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, calling for an extremely limited Federal government with only the rights and powers explicitly stated in the Constitution. He understood that an extensive Federal government could be expensive and despotic, but he also believed a simple, literal interpretation was dangerous. Without considering the intent of the writers, it could easily become corrupt. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "So, referring back to Figure 17, we saw a noticeable drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of our project. It was somewhat disheartening, and it's tricky to pinpoint the exact cause. The onset of winter in New England means fewer people commute by bike or on foot, which could account for some of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester, when everyone is busy wrapping up schoolwork and grades. The commuter log might have just slipped off their radar. Additionally, the holiday season can take a toll, with a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, which might also contribute to the low log submissions for that month. However, none of this really explains the low February numbers. It's also possible that any project like this experiences an initial burst of excitement that naturally tapers off. To combat this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which did increase log submissions for that month. So one of the challenges we faced was maintaining project momentum despite these natural decreases and the holidays/semester breaks inherent in higher education.\n\nAnother challenge is the deeply ingrained culture of driving cars. People value the freedom, independence, and flexibility it provides. Thus, it's crucial to provide compelling incentives for alternative commuting. We handed out gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, an independent bookstore, and even some national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see if larger prizes like a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car could boost participation. The nature of the prizes didn't change throughout the project, but perhaps varying the value over time could have helped. The gift cards seemed sufficient at the start, but if we had announced additional bigger prizes in December and January, like bicycles and hybrid/electric cars, participation might have increased instead of decreasing.",
            "So, ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, are like securities that aim to mirror an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, but trade on exchanges like stocks. They offer the benefits of diversification, like index funds, plus the perks of single stock ownership, such as short selling, margin buying, and purchasing shares in any quantity. While these advantages are appealing, ETFs have costs just like mutual funds, with the added expense of trade commissions. One of the best things about ETFs is the wide variety of choices. However, it's always wise for investors to assess whether these claimed benefits, like diversification, truly exist and how significantly they impact performance. Let's dive into the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings to see if owning one ETF is as beneficial as owning a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks.\n\nFor simplicity, we'll only consider the top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF. Here they are:\n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF, we'll use their current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate their contributions to portfolio Beta and Return. The results are as follows:\n\nFrom the chart, it's clear that a portfolio of just the top ten holdings offers a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, a 16% boost, with a lower Beta of 0.12. It seems that a portfolio of these top ten stocks could provide better returns with less risk. However, we need to check if the means of these two portfolios are statistically different.\n\nTo determine this, we'll examine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, and compare their total standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "So, Edgar Allan Poe had this poem called \"Dream-Land,\" which he considered one of his better works. In this piece, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced back to Virgil. Virgil mentioned Thulé in his writings, describing it as an island north of Britain, marking the edge of the known world for the Greeks. While Virgil did use the term, there's a more recent source that Poe might have been influenced by: Goethe.\n\nThis connection is important because it shows Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" pointed out the similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, suggesting that Poe was likely emulating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a renowned writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe's death, 1832. Within the second part of Faust, there's a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. After her passing, he becomes consumed by grief and drinking, eventually deciding to end his life. He gives his possessions to his children, keeps the goblet, walks to a cliff, throws it into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies.\n\nThe king in \"The King of Thule\" and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, mirroring a dark doppelganger of Poe's loss and his drinking habit. The romantic drama based on Faust, created by H. P. Grattan in 1842, was published just a year before Poe's use of the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his collected works. He uses \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and in \"Dream-Land,\" using the term as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and haunted by dead friends, seeing a shaded world without color. These scenes echo the themes from \"The King of Thule,\" where the king is overcome with grief, loneliness, and a loss of will to live.\n\nGoethe was a notable author whom Poe would have known, not just for his connection to Tennyson but also because of the many reproductions of his work following the original publications.",
            "So under California law, let's break it down. Could a customer injured from slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store get punitive damages by proving the store manager acted with malice? Maybe. To make this case stick, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, would need to show that the manager, Paul Martin, was aware of the risk of harm and still chose to ignore it. She can point out that multiple previous incidents occurred due to unaddressed spills and that Martin knew this. His actions, such as not cleaning the spill while he was eating, could be seen as despicable, but less so than the fact that he ignored repeated requests to clean up. The judge is unlikely to dismiss her case outright, but it might face challenges in proving that Martin's actions were truly malicious and not just negligent.\n\nOn that fateful day, October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee alerted Martin about the applesauce spill, but he was on a dinner break and didn't want to deal with it. Another employee tried again at 5:15 pm, but Martin gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, resulting in a serious back injury. Palmer is now suing for damages, and we are considering whether to file a motion to dismiss part of her claim. To recover punitive damages in California, one must show the defendant acted with oppression, fraud, or malice. For malice, conduct must have been intended to cause harm or, if not intended, it must be despicable and committed with a willful disregard for others' rights. The judge might find that Martin's actions were maliciously indifferent to the safety of others, but this claim might be tough to prove.",
            "Well, almost four years back, I took a course on Islam over at CBC. One of the major points of contention in that class was the question of whether or not Islam is inherently hostile. Funny thing is, I think that debate's even more pertinent today than it was then. Looking back on the world since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the mass media's stance on Islam and extremists—from outright hostility to a near-worshipping tolerance. I mean, can you imagine, in 2001, having a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his clear Muslim roots?\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has always intrigued me. The more I've learned about his history, the more I'm struck by how his life doesn't quite match the image portrayed in the biography. From what I've known and studied before, I always thought Muhammad was the type to use force to convert people to Islam—conquering tribes and imposing his religion on them. But according to the biography, he's written as a sort of martyr, misunderstood and humbled. It's like, one by one, people started seeking him out. Huh, that's quite different from my previous understanding.\n\nThere are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad. The most notable one is the multiplication of mutton and milk to feed forty men. This style of storytelling makes me believe they were trying to elevate Muhammad to this humble, truth-living prophet who didn't need to prove his points through miracles. It's like they're stealing Jesus's thunder, making Muhammad seem like a basically perfect, Christ-like figure. That rubs me the wrong way.\n\nThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that seem to serve as some sort of proof of 'witnesses' converting to Islam on their own. Trouble is, these stories often come from third-party sources—like, \"So-and-so heard from this person who heard from that person.\" I don't like this because, while their intention might be to validate the stories through hearsay, it just makes the stories seem even more dubious.\n\nThe thing that bugs me the most is how they try to portray Muhammad as this godly, humble, endearing, and wise figure. History, however, tells a different story. It's like they're trying to whitewash Muhammad's rise to power. I can't help but think if Muslims today are aware of the real history behind their prophet.",
            "Well, the teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly forgotten when Christianity began to develop beyond his life. If we look at the big picture, Christianity seems to have been drifting farther and farther from its roots. Today's world shows a growing trend of progressive thinking, but tradition-holding individuals may not be enough to steer the whole. Among Christians, a deeper historical understanding will grow in the coming years. There will be a longing to distinguish the doctrines added to Christianity over time from the original intentions of its founder. This process may take decades or even centuries, but it's inevitable: Christianity will revert to its original form. A movement will emerge, peeling away layers of doctrine, like rewinding time, until only Jesus' original message remains. When this trend reaches the United States and Europe, it will influence many to worship as if they're living during Jesus' time, following only his ideas. The church will remain strong, leading the way, but the diversity of beliefs and practices will lessen, with similarities replacing differences among regions, denominations, and divisions. History is full of reversals. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire but later, the empire itself became Christian. Our country has seen African-American slavery turn into African-American leadership. The future of Christianity will follow this pattern, undoing history to find its source and reducing diversity. A vital part of this process will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. So, what has changed since Jesus' time?",
            "I hold that \"The Jungle\" reveals how at our core, humans are inherently greedy and selfish. Our chief concern is to make our own lives as comfortable and prosperous as possible, but we pay no heed to those beneath us. The novel illustrates this through the factory owners and managers who are solely focused on expanding their empires. They are unmoved by the harm caused by their operations, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" a vivid description of the environmental devastation. They show no concern for the workers or the animals who suffer due to the factories' emissions and waste. The owners' sole goal is profit, exemplified by their exploitation of employees: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They push workers to their limits, laying off mass numbers without notice or compensation. In that period, few laws or protections existed for workers, allowing managers to run rampant. The book suggests that those who perished in Packingtown were expected to endure the miserable conditions without aid or escape. Organizations to assist workers were scarce, and unions often exacerbated the plight of the workers by lining their pockets at the workers' expense. The workers were trapped in a system that treated them like slaves, as \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "Many authors employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or perspectives in their readers regarding important subjects. Some techniques work better than others. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald uses several of these methods. Often, he couples adjectives and nouns in unusual ways to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. Alternatively, he assigns meaning to symbols and then utilizes them for this purpose. Fitzgerald employs this latter technique with numerous colors, such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald constructs a particular significance for white/gray and red/pink colors, which he later employs to engender specific associations with significant subjects.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald assigns to white/gray is uniformity, with white symbolizing a higher social status and gray denoting older, faded elements. This is evident early in the novel, as characters are frequently depicted in white. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as “in white” (8), and even Nick wears “white flannels” (41) at Gatsby’s party. Only when Nick describes Gatsby’s party does he mention other colors, such as “gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald reinforces this association by coloring everyday subjects in white/gray. For instance, Nick’s work commute is described as “down the white chasms of lower New York” (56), and people’s names at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61) on his schedule. Furthermore, common or unimportant characters and places are often associated with white or gray. For example, Jordan and Daisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, and there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes. Similarly, the “Italian child” on the train is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is a “gray old man” (27).\n\nLater, Fitzgerald uses these colors to convey a sense of uniformity or unimportance around significant subjects, particularly through his portrayal of Daisy. After a prolonged period without notable mentions of either color, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in a “little white roadster,” making her seem less like a character and more like a mere addition to Gatsby’s pursuits (74). He further uses this technique to depict Daisy as a uniform addition, for example, with a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",
            "San Diego County, with its mild and sunny climate, is a hotspot for agriculture. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers are common crops. The demand for organic, community-supported agriculture is substantial, with many local organizations boasting long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also quite popular. Some organic farms offer tours of their operations and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This setup allows landowners to benefit from government programs while also enhancing habitat, offering recreational use, and generating income through tours and educational programs.",
            "Culture, it's a thing that's crucial in any negotiation. It's not just a single, uniform thing, but it's made up of what it isn't and what it stands for too. It's not all the same everywhere, and it's not a static thing either. So saying things like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is too broad. It's better to understand how the culture of the people you're dealing with affects the negotiation, especially if you're from a different culture. When you're dealing with a foreign culture, you'll naturally compare it to your own, but that's okay. Understanding a culture involves more than just learning its history, it's about understanding its prejudices too. Instead of judging or trying to change them, you just need to accept them and work within their boundaries, especially if you're at a disadvantage in the negotiation. If you're on \"home turf,\" respecting their traditions and beliefs can help you get past any cultural barriers and move things forward.\n\nCulture isn't just about national or international differences. Even within the same country, companies can have their own unique cultures. For example, some companies might emphasize long hours, while others might have a more relaxed schedule. You can see these differences in things like employee dress codes, how they communicate, and how they hire people. Some companies encourage philanthropy at all levels, while others only do it through \"company approved\" charities. Just look at American corporate culture to see how diverse it is. Even within a single company, there can be different cultures based on location or environment. Some cultures may seem more uniform, but that's just the surface. You need to look deeper to understand them.\n\nValues are key because they tell you why a culture is the way it is. If saving face or communal harmony is important, a negotiator won't publicly humiliate their company or their boss to win. Likewise, if a negotiator comes from a culture that favors tough bargaining, they won't rush to settle early. Understanding these generalities before the negotiation is important, but it's also good to know something about your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "So the fool in his heart once proclaimed, \"There is no God.\" This notion is first seen in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and also stands at the center of St. Anselm’s argument for God's existence. This view is also echoed by another author we'll discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Since both arguments are aimed at proving the same divine entity, specifically the God of the Bible, let's start by assuming they are both correct in their belief. To compare their arguments effectively, we must assume they are discussing the same God. So, while each of them offers valid points, neither presents a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nSt. Anselm’s approach begins with faith, emphasizing that understanding God requires looking within oneself. He argues that since God exists within our minds, we cannot imagine his nonexistence. This idea, while somewhat complicated, posits that proof of God's existence lies within our own consciousness. St. Anselm suggests we don't need external evidence to find truth about God; it's inherently within our minds. This is often referred to as faith in Christian teachings.\n\nThomas Aquinas, however, takes a different stance. He believes God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without needing faith. This argument is advantageous for evangelism, as it can persuade converts without relying on their willingness to accept unprovable faith. St. Thomas presents five logical arguments to support his claim: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument demonstrates that the need for God is logically necessary, even without direct observation.\n\nIn essence, Aquinas argues that logical deductions can prove God's existence, much like knowing a missing puzzle piece's features without seeing it.",
            "Long ago, around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned the world and achieved enlightenment, giving birth to the teachings that would become Buddhism, with its most traditional branch being known as Theravada Buddhism. This religion has been around for about 2500 years, and it has evolved significantly since Buddha's time. You can see these changes in various places, such as in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where an annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Monks and laypeople alike participate in this event, which has some religious significance, even though Buddha never taught about such a festivity.\n\nThe changes in Buddhism over time can be seen in both its superficial traditions and its core beliefs. The Theravada Buddhist community, whether from a monastic or lay perspective, has had to adjust its doctrinal principles over the years due to both internal and external factors, as well as hostile and benign influences. To better understand this discussion, let's define some key terms. Internal forces refer to influences coming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of one's status, while external forces refer to influences from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are any that aim to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often stemming from negative perceptions of Buddhism. Benign forces, on the other hand, do not intend to harm or help the community but may do so indirectly.\n\nTo delve into the basics of Theravada Buddhism, we must first explore its core doctrinal principles. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the metaphysical components of Buddhism, such as Anatta (no self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). By recognizing these concepts, one can escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and along with it, lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), ultimately achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets rules for life, with laypeople following five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances), while monks follow many more disciplinary rules. The fundamental doctrine in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: first, that life is suffering (Dukkha); second, that attachment is the cause of suffering; third, that suffering can be overcome; and fourth, the path to the end of suffering.",
            "So, let me tell you a story about two nations, the United States of America and Mexico. They had a long-standing rivalry that lasted for a whopping 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the U.S. attacked and conquered Mexico, gaining Texas and the American Southwest as new territory. There were many other skirmishes between them, which finally softened just before the First World War.\n\nTheir rivalry started over key issues like religion, culture, and tradition, with a significant clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31). It's not unlike many other nations that have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor; nations sharing a border often have conflicting interests, leading to rivalries. The U.S. and Mexico are no different. David M. Pletcher (1977) put it this way, “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).\n\nReligious differences were a huge rift between them, similar to many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) stated, “if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy” (p.86). This ideological struggle was not about political structure but religious preferences. The distrust between the United States and Mexico stemmed from the distrust between the English and Spanish, which was passed down from their colonial rulers. This lingering mistrust made it difficult to establish friendly foreign relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) listed 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes were about territorial issues, like border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a significant issue that persisted until both nations used military force to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) noted that the rivalry began to ease as Mexico became highly dependent on the United States, and it finally ended when American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico (p. 109-110) in the latter part of the 19th Century.",
            "Well, it's been a long time since I was struck with a sudden and unforeseen disability, around 15 years ago. I was working as a nurse, a job I chose for a sense of security and safety that I lacked during my childhood. I kept hearing that people would always get sick, so I figured nursing was a safe bet. Even though my heart yearned for a career in science or journalism, the security of a consistent job was too appealing to pass up.\n\nBut life had other plans. At 46, I found myself unable to work, my body broken by an illness I never saw coming. My savings were dwindling, and after 15 long years of relying on Social Security Disability, I have little left to call my own. Every day is a struggle, a constant assault on my security and self-esteem. I am reminded daily that nothing in life is certain, yet I know I've made it this far only because of the support of my family and a few good friends. Alone, I'd be lost.\n\nMy message is clear: life is unpredictable. There will always be challenges, and no amount of preparation can shield you from everything. Sure, we should be wise and self-reliant, but the American spirit was not built on rugged individualism alone. It was built on compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. People didn't conquer the Rockies by going it alone; they did it together.\n\nSo, while I have a disaster kit and supplies, I also encourage you to build relationships with your neighbors. Trust, compassion, and mutual aid are the foundations of any strong community. Let's learn to help each other and ask for help when we need it, rather than isolating ourselves. After all, no one can go it alone forever.",
            "Why do organisms evolve the way they do? Are there limitations or factors that influence the trajectory of evolutionary change? While D’Arcy Thompson in 1917 said, “Even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,” the same can be said today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny, as seen in studies like Raup and Stanley's work in 1981. Our research explores how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, in conjunction with experimental studies, can help understand the mechanisms behind the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. Using X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies with software like CerioShell. These models help interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum, and the results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better grasp macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that extends over time through 360 degrees of space. These turns in the shell's spiral are called whorls, which revolve around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which whorls enlarge can vary, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl, called the body whorl, is the last one. The spire is the part of the shell without the body whorl, with the apex at the top and the base at the bottom. The animal's exit from the shell is through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles—apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, first, view the shell from the apical side to locate the first suture, then draw a line dividing the shell. Count whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and the horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formula is established, parameters can be varied and modified to alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "For the past decade, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have remained quite stable. Although the country has made progress towards many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the progress on child and maternal health indicators is lagging considerably, making it challenging to achieve the 2015 targets. The reasons for these shortcomings are multifaceted and suggest that strengthening the overall health system is a more pressing need than focusing on specific programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% of births now meeting this standard. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions during complicated pregnancies, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate due to hemorrhage. This indicates that while progress has been made, there is still significant work to be done in this area. Additionally, there has been a decrease in the percentage of diarrhea cases in children under five years treated by a healthcare professional, and postnatal care remains a concern with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain relatively low at around 4%, with only 2% in rural areas compared to 7% in urban areas. This highlights a severe issue of healthcare access disparity across the country, with services concentrated in urban areas. Furthermore, there is a significant gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, with a 27% difference, indicating that the poor have greater difficulty accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal health indicators, the primary question is how best to address the lack of service. Should Indonesia focus on developing program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without concentrating on pre- and post-pregnancy care? While programmatic approaches offer targeted and manageable objectives with faster results, they also come with significant drawbacks. Investing heavily in one area can lead to insufficient funding for other sectors and may result in human resources being drawn to better-resourced programs. Running multiple parallel programs without coordination can also lead to duplication of services and increased administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their intricate detail and focus on the aristocracy of the era. Two notable Victorian works that break from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels incorporate an element of mystery and an unconventional twist, which enriches their characters and deepens our understanding of their motivations and emotions. In Oliver Twist, for instance, such elements are often revealed through dream sequences or dreamlike states. These strange occurrences often shed light on Oliver’s inner turmoil, his awareness of his surroundings, and the true nature of events around him. When Oliver revisits the shooting of himself in chapter 28, he experiences it as if in a dream, grappling to find help. The passage emphasizes Oliver’s lack of control over the unfolding events and the dire state of his health, evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself numbs all his senses, and he doesn’t notice the “unseen hand” that carries him away. He relives his despair removed from the initial shock of pain, now constant and linked with fear. This shooting underscores Oliver’s inability to take control of his circumstances, even when his life is at stake. It suggests a growing sense of defeat, as if Fagin has broken him, forcing him to accept his despair and influencing his ability to react. It is implied that Oliver would have made some effort to save his life had he not been overwhelmed by his circumstances.",
            "A couple of years back, I was part of an after-school program where I tutored elementary age students. I did my best to assist them in any subjects they were struggling with, but my strengths lay in English and reading. One particular student, Adrian, needed help with reading and it quickly became apparent that something wasn't right. He could read perfectly, but he had peculiar difficulties with certain letters. It didn't make sense; he spoke perfect English, but the problem was that he didn't know the English alphabet well. One day, his mother arrived. She spoke only Spanish, and even with my limited Spanish, we managed to communicate. That's when I realized Adrian's issue; he could read, but he didn't know the English alphabet. I'm not sure if that revelation helped him, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the challenge of language barriers in schools, especially in California. It shows that even when a child speaks perfect English, reading can still be a hurdle. I believe we all agree this is an issue, so what can we do about it? For Adrian, the solution was straightforward: he needed tutoring in English reading, especially the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none of these alone can solve the problem. The key is to combine all these methods!\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a great idea, not just for Spanish-speaking children, but for all kids. Studies show that children in these programs outperform their peers academically. However, there's a lot of fear surrounding this idea, that it's a waste of resources. That's not true. If we implemented these programs in all classrooms, all children would benefit. How do we do it? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic. But we can certainly have bilingual aids or tutors to assist.",
            "From the time we are kids, we're often told there's something larger than ourselves, something we can't comprehend. Some of us are taught about it in Sunday school, others in temples, or we look within ourselves for answers. Many of us just accept what our parents believed, while some reject it and believe in nothing beyond our own egocentric universe. We may adopt one value system, then change our minds later. Whatever path we choose, we define a part of ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives. We seek a light to guide us out of the darkness and into the sun.\n\n\"Cardinals,\" my dad said when I asked him about his favorite bird. We were sitting on the porch, listening to the rain, smoking our cigarettes. The gutters overflowed, drowning the plants at the edge. He seemed distant, thinner, and his hair was sparse.

I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and watched the rain with him.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation didn't ease his suffering, but kept him alive a few months longer. I couldn't watch him leave this life. I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. I curled up and waited for the news.\n\nNo one called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in essence, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt puts it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both criticized and celebrated, accused of lacking depth and praised for its 'terrible sublime' effect (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined ideas from \"ancient and modern\" romances to establish the Gothic genre and a new mode of literary expression. Walpole used \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to create what he termed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre incorporates numerous throwbacks to medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. When The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated. The blend of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing for a more personal view of characters' psychology) has kept Gothic relevant for centuries, making it both obsolete and fresh for readers far removed from its original period.\n\nOne prominent Gothic theme found in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is crucial to Gothic writers because it represents the classic knight—brave, honorable, and competent—while also highlighting their perceived lack of these qualities in contemporary society. By employing chivalric concepts and mannerisms, the \"Gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the genre's future evolution into Romanticism. Walpole, writing during a politically tumultuous period and grappling with unfair accusations, may have begun to question the morality and innate \"goodness\" of people, as compared to the supposed ideals of the Gothic era. This notion is evident in several characters, including Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, the reader learns that he embodies many chivalric traits. He is described as:\n\nThe description includes numerous traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently thought to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course, exaggerated, bringing into play the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",

But then again, if you like a course, it's probably because it's easy to understand. Catch 22 situation. I'll find out the appeal result this week. On the brighter side, nothing much else happened. Guess that's it for now. Till next time.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact in jazz music is largely due to his longevity and the creative prowess he brought to his orchestra. His presence on the piano, while subtle in many compositions, showcases his ability to craft rich and intricate pieces that highlight the unique talents of his band members. Ellington designed a framework that allowed for soloists to freely improvise, while also writing tightly orchestrated sections that emphasized the individual styles of his musicians, creating harmonious and original sounds for each piece. His mastery of each player's sound, along with how they blended together in a growing ensemble, allowed him to compose some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's sound and innovation, mentioning his use of voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This is evident in his early piece, Creole Love Call, where Ellington uses voice to add texture and color without lyrics. Here, the voice complements the styles of his soloists, a trait that persists throughout his career. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses, each with a unique call and response between voice and reeds, showcasing Ellington's ability to create a rich tapestry of sound.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a complementary sound. This piece, like many of Ellington’s works, showcases his ability to blend different musical styles and instruments seamlessly. In It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing), Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's unique sound on muted trombone to great effect in introducing the melody.\n\nEllington’s use of voice to add a layer of tone color to his pieces is just one example of his stylistic brilliance that runs throughout his career.",
            "She had always felt a void, a desire that remained unfulfilled. At 14, she started to crave something, and at 17, it was still there. She had figured out she wanted a person, not an object, but she couldn't find any appeal in the boys who showed interest. She questioned her strange condition, yet nothing she theorized seemed satisfactory. So, she carried on, wondering about her desires.\n\nPeace was usually the norm at home. Her parents were calm and never argued much, except when she pushed her boundaries. They were a laid-back couple, but she balanced them with her fun-loving personality, making her quite charming.\n\nToday, however, was different. As she wandered around, searching for inspiration, she heard her mother's scream from the kitchen. She rushed in to find her mother on the ground, hurting. \"Mom! What's wrong?\" she asked, panicking. Her mom was in severe pain, and she directed her daughter to take her to the hospital. The daughter, grateful for her strength training, carried her mother to the car and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the scent of disinfectant and sickness, but she was focused on helping her mother. After handing her over to the doctors, she sat worriedly, waiting for news.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stepladder while reaching for a high cabinet.",

The aMed diet is a tweaked version of the Med diet, featuring higher consumption of plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats) and fish, with lower intake of animal products and saturated fats.

            "Well, 2007 was a year when the United States of America was hit by a severe financial crisis. Unemployment soared, the housing market collapsed, and many of the nation's major corporations were left in shambles. This economic downturn is still ongoing today, so we must ask: how did this crisis come about, and how can we prevent it from happening again? In essence, the financial crisis was caused by self-centered and naive political decisions that pushed banks and firms to offer sub-prime loans, which were sold to an immature and underdeveloped financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to back and package these mortgages into CDOs and CDS'. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks found themselves short on capital reserves and transferred this turmoil to the repacked mortgages they had sold, and eventually to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe origins of this financial crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration. The President was aiming for a second term and sought to boost his popularity, which led to the relaxation of lending restrictions. This paved the way for the sub-prime crisis just seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999 reported, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest mortgage underwriter, faced increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income people, while also feeling pressure from shareholders to maintain its remarkable growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: \"However, the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, necessitating a government rescue similar to that of the Savings and Loan industry in the 1980s.\" As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foretold, imprudent lending would indeed lead to the economy’s collapse.\n\nSeveral factors combined to push the economy into a tailspin, with one being the complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs were widely used in the years before the crisis, further intertwining various economic sectors with the housing market. This overleveraged the U.S. households and financial markets in the housing sector, leaving them highly susceptible to even minor price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which represented about 30% of the USA's GDP. Eventually, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to stringent regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your tale where you flex your writer's muscles and soar, dazzling your readers with your enchanting prose. Or the section where your audience nods off and hits the \"Back\" button, cursing your name. Dr. Merlin herself has caught herself shouting at her screen when she's wading through Too Much Information, and not in the interesting way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still finds herself tripping over long passages where nothing substantial occurs, or worse, too much detail. Exposition is that little imp on your shoulder telling you to rush through the history to get to the good stuff (not to be confused with the imp on the other shoulder pushing to tell your audience every last detail of your characters' backstories).\n\nExposition means laying out what happened, typically in straightforward language. In film, the exposition happens when one character shares a laundry list of information with another, like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the sharing.\n\nConsider this: while reading a story, you're told something like, \"The heroine met her beloved at such a time and place, they were wed in a grand event, and he was murdered in front of her eyes.\" You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to consume two pages, during which both characters exchange only a couple of lines. You'd expect the author to spend time on the husband's character, revealing through his dialogue and actions how deeply he loved his wife, and you'd likewise expect the heroine to show through both big and small ways how his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story later says her love was profound). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to feel his loss as she does and would give you insight into the heroine's life: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so on. You'd mourn his death with her, and so grow more invested in the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you need to provide the substance that brings the story to life. Sometimes it's tempting to hurry through certain aspects. Maybe you're introducing a new character and you know he was in the Air Force, is the night manager of a gas station now, divorced twice, no kids, loves fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and",
            "Yesterday, I caught two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, aired live on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011), discussed a disturbing incident in Ashley, Ohio. The story involved a man named Shad Hostettler who had stabbed his wife; they didn't mention her name, but the mug shot they showed looked chilling. They dedicated only about two minutes to the developing story, which, I believe, was appropriate. The second story, featuring an early morning shooting in Sharon Woods, involved Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old who had been critically injured. There were no arrests at the time, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story was brief, and I suspect that might have been due to the fact that it involved a person of color. I've noticed over the years that crimes against minorities often don't receive as much attention as they deserve. The next story was about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, which was believed to have been caused by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. Following that, they reported on the predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. This segment was brief, but it served as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in. They also covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, where a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt had been involved. They devoted an unusual amount of time to emphasize his race and the fact that he was tall and weighed around 150 pounds. Lastly, they mentioned a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin named Rene Rodriguez, who had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. They also noted his Hispanic background, which, in my opinion, was not relevant to the story.",
            "The bond between brothers is a unique and unyielding connection, filled with a myriad of emotions—love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty among others. Brothers understand each other in a way no one else can, and they often see their own reflection in their sibling. This bond is most apparent in dire situations, where its true nature emerges, be it for better or worse. The emotions that form from this fraternal link come with a significant price. Understanding these emotions means also accepting the consequences they bring. When you look into your brother's eyes, you see yourself as you truly are, not as others perceive you. It is in their actions and the aftermath of those actions that their genuine character is revealed. This theme is vividly explored in “The Scarlet Ibis,” where two brothers embark on a doomed journey, navigating through a lush landscape. The story is rich with Doodle's direct characterization and his interactions with his older brother, as well as with the narrator's perspective, which provides insight into the complex emotions and actions of both characters.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single emotion: pride. From the time he first goes out with Doodle to their final, tragic excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his younger brother. He yearned for a companion he could teach all his skills, such as holding his breath, running, and climbing trees, as well as someone to race with and perch with in the tallest pine. However, Doodle's frail heart made it unlikely he would ever participate in such activities. This placed a heavy burden on the protagonist, whose dreams were dashed in an instant. This realization even led him to contemplate harming Doodle, illustrating the depth of his resentment. Yet, his heart softened when Doodle simply smiled at him, showing that his initial intentions were not truly evil. The smile gave the protagonist hope, highlighting his underlying love for his brother, despite his initial resentment.",
            "The human brain, an intricate and imaginative information processor, has seen its metaphors evolve with technological progress. From a wax tablet to a computer, these metaphors help us understand the brain but can also lead to misconceptions. Information begins as sensory inputs, transforming physical stimuli like touch, warmth, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. These signals are processed through algorithms, both bottom-up and top-down. For instance, when you see a black box on white paper, bottom-up processing combines simple details like color and edge borders to recognize it as a box. Top-down processing then speeds up your recognition by using prior decisions. The brain's attention filter sorts information's importance, deciding which cognitive processes to prioritize. For example, while walking, you might notice your name in a noisy room, ignoring individual blades of grass. This processing involves multiple stages, modulated by attention.\n\nInformation storage is crucial for the brain. There are various types of memory, such as sensory, working, and long-term. Encoding involves converting sensory inputs into different types of information, like structural, phonetic, or semantic. Working memory, with a brief storage period, is maintained by electrical signals looping through specific neurons. Long-term memory is believed to rely on specific protein structures. Multiple models organize knowledge in the brain, ranging from human memory retrieval to computer science and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes nodes representing concepts linked by their relatedness, such as \"chair\" linked to \"table\" and \"wooden\"",
            "Aldous Huxley voices concern over the looming threat of technology and capitalistic systems, creating a dystopian society in Brave New World. The citizenry prioritizes community over individualism and is conditioned from birth to chase happiness at all costs. They are pawns in a larger scheme controlled by the World Controller, who dictates their ideology. Examining the novel through a Marxist lens reveals Huxley's skepticism about these emerging systems, using terms like homogenization and reification to highlight its flaws.\n\nCapitalism is critiqued through the concept of false consciousness. The common folks are kept unaware of their true economic relations, focusing instead on self-interest. This is achieved through the proletariat's ideological control, evident in Brave New World's conditioning. The common classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, lack free will and are driven to consume and indulge. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where social classes are dominated by a separate group, is clear. The lower classes are unaware of manipulation, being \"sold on an ideology that upholds the structure\" (capitalism and consumerism). Even the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, accept their status, with few exceptions like Bernard. The societal interactions reveal the oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships are shallow. Characters lack depth, even among major figures. Huxley might suggest that technology and capitalism rob individuals of free will and expression. Love doesn't exist, nor intense emotions; interactions are superficial. Males comment on females' physical appearance, and females discuss their encounters casually. Each societal class' complacency with their role indicates capitalism's socioeconomic effects. Their unquestioning obedience signifies Marxist thought, where the proletariat are made to believe they are superior as long as they consume and adhere to their peers.",
            "Well, I've been hanging out at University Park for nearly two and a half years now, which adds up to four semesters. Navigating the campus can be a real pain, especially for freshmen. My first year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, pretty much at the farthest point east on campus. Just getting to classes in places like Willard building could take up to 25 minutes on foot, and that's not counting the bad weather we usually get in State College. Turns out, not too long ago, East Halls were isolated from the rest of the campus by vast empty spaces. Now, those have been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services center, and apartments. As campus keeps growing, it's getting harder to get around. So, what's the best solution to the campus commute conundrum? Bikes are the way to go.\n\nMy buddy just started riding again after a long break, and he's loving it. “Bikes are awesome,” he says, “they're the only way to get around.” Besides being good for your body, they're the most efficient mode of transport. A bowl of oats and a little workout can cover 30 miles no problem. I, too, live off campus, about as far from the center as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was getting a bike. Thomas building, where I have class every day, is a 25-minute walk from my place. On my bike, that time cuts to 5 minutes. The only downside is Pollock Road, the fastest route to Thomas, isn't always a smooth ride. Still, walking takes too much time, especially when you're as busy as I am. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option. Walking to Thomas would add 30-40 minutes each day, and that's over two and a half hours a week. Let's not forget the extra time for other classes, appointments, and so on. That's a lot of time I can't spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In my pursuit of a career in social work, I aspire to join the Division of Family and Children Services to assist youngsters who have endured abuse or neglect; and to offer support to distressed families. The values I bring to the social work field are: service, respect, ethical integrity, a commitment to fostering healthier relationships, and a dedication to personal growth to remain proficient in my career. These core values are significant not only to social workers but also to me personally.\n\nI've always yearned to lend a helping hand, though I was uncertain about the right career path. Throughout my high school and college years, I observed many individuals shun their problems in denial, employing coping strategies that were less than optimal. Witnessing such situations, I decided to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Post-graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break. One summer, visiting a friend, I met a sixteen-year-old boy nervously sitting on her couch. Learning he had fled his abusive parents, I drove to his home to offer help. The police, unable to intervene further, asked me to speak with his parents. They seemed defensive and blamed his \"manipulative\" behavior for involving outsiders. This encounter convinced me to consider social work to aid children in family disputes.\n\nAnother vital aspect for social work is social justice. Our society claims to value individuality but often mourns lost souls while pushing everyone to conform to archaic norms. I don't adhere to such limitations and have consistently protested against social injustices. In high school and college, I expressed my individuality through unconventional hairstyles, attire, and piercings, joined GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and stood against racism and discrimination. I uphold social justice and will continue to fight against it.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to insomnia. The Biological model delves into genetic factors and medical aspects of sleep health, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental relationships and their influence on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models and chooses specific studies to illustrate and enhance our understanding of them. Each study's findings and explanations are then critically evaluated to highlight their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, those linked to other mental disorders, and those related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders like Dyssomnias and Parasomnias are standalone issues, while those related to mental disorders can be associated with Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). Other sleep disorders may result from medical complications or substance use. Key Dyssomnias include Primary Insomnia (difficulty in adequate or maintained sleep), Primary Hypersomnia (difficulty staying awake for at least a month), Narcolepsy (cataplexy and/or automatic REM episodes), Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Parasomnias involve behavioral abnormalities and physiological occurrences, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. This review primarily focuses on insomnia and touches on primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders centers around genes, heritable factors, and physiological aspects. Orexin neurons in the hypothalamus regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice found that Phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons control sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. A GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time in the study, suggesting the findings can be generalized to humans. This implies that genetic and environmental factors influence the functioning of the GABAB receptor in humans, affecting sleep without medication. If the receptor is altered, it can disrupt sleep, impacting aspects of life like school, career, and daily tasks requiring focus.",
            "So, this paper delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, it provides a simple definition of the disorder. Following that, it explains how CAPD is diagnosed, highlighting common symptoms, or so-called \"red flags\". Lastly, it offers tips for how a teacher in a mainstream classroom can assist a student with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is essentially how efficiently the central nervous system (CNS) processes and uses auditory information. In other words, it's a condition where the brain fails to properly interpret sounds. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally but may struggle with separating words or differentiating conversations from background noise, making them appear as if they have hearing difficulties, although they don't.\n\nThe earliest known mention of this disorder was in the mid-1950s, when it was called \"auditory imperception\". Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began testing children with communication issues in 1954, and Canadian researcher Kimura later introduced dichotic testing in 1961. These developments sparked further research in the field.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways: a person might struggle to pinpoint where sound is coming from, differentiate between multiple sounds, recognize sound patterns, detect changes in speech (like sarcasm), be distracted by subsequent sounds, or interpret the sequence of sounds correctly. Diagnosing CAPD involves observing the patient's listening behavior and performance on specific auditory function tests, conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, or others. There isn't a single, foolproof test for CAPD, nor is there a known cause for the disorder. Tests often present patients with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask them to identify specific items, like words or numbers. Advanced tests might involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "In \"Twelfth Night,\" it seems that while disguises can be handy for lengthy deceptions, ultimately, one must discard their masquerade to avoid losing their true self. The challenge with revealing a deception, though, is the potential for alienation from those around you. Some might remain unaffected, but others may take offense at being tricked.\n\nThe theme of gender disguise is complicated. It raises questions about why someone would adopt an opposite-gender identity. For Viola, it's a form of self-preservation: \"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249) Arriving in a new land, she feels the need to impersonate a man to protect herself. Her plan succeeds, but it isolates her from women, cutting her off from important support. She also faces issues with her romantic feelings for Sebastian/Orsino and Olivia's infatuation with Cesario/Viola: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\n\nHowever, this could be seen as a progressive outlook, showing how deception can expose hidden emotions. In Olivia and Orsino's case, it appears their subconscious desires are stirred by Cesario's presence. Is Olivia attracted to Cesario because he's a man, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? It's likely the former, as Olivia seems to change her affections quickly, switching from Cesario to Sebastian and considering Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "German colonial rule has been widely recognized for its harshness, particularly in the case of the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in German South West Africa. It's important to note that describing the entire German colonial empire through such a simple lens is impossible. The empire's policies and governance style varied greatly across its extensive territory. Educational initiatives were just as varied. For instance, when the British took over German East Africa (now Tanzania), they discovered a considerable number of educated and literate Africans. Similarly, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were commended by contemporary authors. However, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) was quite different. Unlike in East Africa, where the government played a significant role in educating the natives, in South West Africa, the education of locals was largely left to missionary societies who received minimal government support. The government did, however, invest substantially in the education of Europeans, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies had numerous literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the overwhelming majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper aims to explore these factors and delve into new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\nThere's a plethora of literature on education in the German colonial empire, much of it written in German in the early 20th century, during or shortly after German rule. These early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems of the colonies. Later English-language works expanded on this by conducting comparative studies across the German colonies and offering more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in educational systems among the colonies. Cohen’s study on education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly notable. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and discusses the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa explains many of the distinctive features of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately pleasant climate, with much of the territory covered by arid desert. The European population in South West Africa reflected these relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913, there were nearly 15,000 whites in South West Africa, compared to just 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "Another decade has passed, with the evolution of popular music's classification reaching an unprecedented extent. The once broad spectrum of genres has now expanded to encompass so many sub-genres that it's practically impossible to enumerate them all. This is further complicated by the fact that even the most prominent genres, like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres within their respective domains. Within this vast landscape, the sub-genre of heavy metal rock stands out as one of the most versatile and expressive genres of popular music over the past 40 years. It is expressive because it delves deeply into a wide array of emotions, often favoring the darker aspects of human experience. Its diversity lies in the early recognition of its flexibility, which allowed musicians to create their own sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, continuing this trend to the present day.\n\nToday, the heavy metal scene is so fragmented that identifying what constitutes heavy metal can be challenging. It has absorbed elements from various genres, yet it has its roots in something authentic. To truly grasp the metal music we encounter today, one must first understand the essence of the metal movement and why it transcends mere genre classification.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement rooted in darkness. It is a music of extremes—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. There is less simplicity, more skill. Musicians in metal bands are highly proficient, and this expertise is evident in their music. Metal is also intrinsically linked to the drug culture of the mid-70s, where psychedelic drugs fueled the creation of otherworldly records. It embodies dark, visceral qualities that were relatively uncharted territory in the music scene, where the darker emotional spectrum was often overlooked. Furthermore, later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prominent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following exemplify the darkness that permeates the movement:",
            "Way before the Surrealists were splashing dreamy colors onto canvas, Henri Rousseau was busy crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is a masterclass in his personal aspirations and internal tug-of-war. On one hand, he yearned for acceptance, recognition, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts. On the other hand, he struggled with whether to conform to established painting styles or forge his own path. The Dream encapsulates this lifelong conflict.\n\nTo truly grasp the significance of The Dream, let's first delve a bit into Rousseau's life. Born in Laval, northwest France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau didn't have much formal art training. Instead, he worked as a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, until the age of forty. Despite his plain circumstances, he dreamt of a new life through painting, offering solace after the tragedies of his first wife's and eight infant children's deaths. Unlike his peers, who romanticized peasants in their art, Rousseau remained a folk painter, reflecting the hopes and dreams of the average citizen.\n\nRousseau’s desire for acceptance was understandable given his situation. He started his artistic journey late and in the shadow of many renowned artists. He only began to gain recognition around the time Matisse was building his reputation. Jan Gordon in Modern French Painters notes that while both artists competed in the art world, their motivations were different. Matisse sought to paint unconventionally to avoid clichés, while Rousseau aimed to paint conventionally to be accepted by the Artiste Français (92).",
            "Many a great philosopher has pondered the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics. I believe this is because the essence of both lies in something ineffable. As John Keats put it in his famous \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty — That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While we often learn about ethics and aesthetics through education and experience, our appreciation of them seems to come naturally. Ethics and aesthetics, you see, are not about prescribing rules, but rather trying to understand why something is moral or beautiful. We grapple with the intricacies of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, talking about elements like contrast and cultural context, but in the end, the true reason behind its beauty eludes us. It's often that intangible \"something\" that makes us appreciate a piece of art or literature. This je ne sais quoi is what makes art and morality so powerful, and it's this transcendental nature that binds them together.\n\nWe experience both ethics and aesthetics at a deep, almost mystical level, a place where we can feel them but not entirely explain them. This is especially true of literature's moral quality, as McKean suggests. He notes that, unlike other arts like music, literature is uniquely tied to our moral lives because it reflects the values we hold dear. This moral quality is why literature is so important to us, and why ethics and aesthetics are so closely intertwined.",
            "Germany today stands as a mighty nation, its unique culture stretching from the alpine peaks of München to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This blend can be felt along the Rhine in Köln, through the heart of Germany, and into the Elbe Valley in Dresden. Given this diverse culture, it's not surprising that Germany, as we know it, is a fusion of various sources and tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a name with uncertain origins. Some scholars believe it came from the Germanic Tribe known as the Tungrians, who were later called Germans. Others think it might be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" suggesting loud or noisy people. Tacitus, in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98, describes the Germans as aboriginal and not intermingled with other races. He notes that no one would choose to leave the comforts of Rome for the harsh lands of Germania, unless it was their home. The Romans, while sending out expeditions to trade and conquer, mostly returned to their empire. This led to the Germanic tribes residing on the empire's borders, trading goods and skills, and sometimes serving in the Roman army.",
            "I stood there, staring down at the view in front of me, my mind blank like a canvas awaiting inspiration. Unemotionally, silently, I observed the picture before me, my practiced awareness taking it all in but refusing to connect it to any abstract idea. Thoughts flowed in and out of my mind so quickly, it was as if I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and fluid experience of what I was seeing. Once, an artist I'd worked with suggested I buy a book called 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain'. I'd been wanting to learn to draw since I was six, and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to how the brain interprets lines. One of the techniques it teaches is to place a square frame around any picture you want to study, turning a complex scene into a simple one. At the time, I couldn't quite mentally project that artist's frame. I was too overwhelmed, too awestruck to do anything but stand and gaze in wonderment. Picasso's blue phase, Monet's love for greenery, the Italian Renaissance masters' vibrant colors - if I had any artistic pretensions, here was where my picture began, my story started, 'Work in Brown'.\n\nMy hand touched the handle of my chosen tool, muscles tensing and relaxing as I guided it through space, my mind's will taking shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Pieces of matter broke away and were carried away to nothingness. But the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet with more urgency. The offensive brown package just wouldn't budge, stuck like a slug on the toilet's bottom. I stood there, a mop in hand, feet set a foot apart, a green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat. I frowned, staring at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more quiet moments to myself, and then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the end of the toilet paper, and began to wrap itself around and around like an oven mitt. Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "So another month has gone by, and of course, my life is pretty much the same old thing. Not much happened, except for the usual stuff. I've been thinking about teen drivers and the alarming rates of fatal accidents among them. The National Institutes of Health say that a part of the problem is that their brains just aren't ready for the risks of driving. Plus, they're just inexperienced, which leads to more crashes, rollovers, speeding, and driving off-road. And if you think it's bad when they're alone, it's even worse when they drive with their peers. A study from the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center shows that the more passengers there are, the more accidents happen.\n\nStates have tried to make teens safer by putting restrictions on their licenses, like only letting them drive during certain hours and not with other minors. But these are just temporary fixes. The real problem is that teens, as a group, aren't ready to handle the responsibilities of driving. Even psychologist Marvin Zuckerman says 18 is too young. He's done research showing that teens under 19-20 love to take risks just for the thrill of it. So, we should delay driving until this urge starts to fade. If we don't, we'll see more accidents and the death toll could get way worse. By 2010, the younger Baby Boomers will be driving, and millions of new teen drivers will hit the road.\n\nLegislation could be simple. Schools could teach driving basics, but no one under 18 could drive. A permit could still be issued, but a certain number of practical training hours would be required, like the 6 hours behind the wheel and 50 hours with an adult that California requires. Since the problem affects teens across the nation, uniform national legislation would be a reasonable and effective solution. This idea isn't new, but it could really make a difference.",
            "So I decided to dive into the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, specifically looking at the fifteen trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films were known for their creative editing, which often created illusions. My focus in studying these films was to describe the poetic elements they used, particularly in the majority of trick films, and to explore the unique characteristics of a few later films. Most of these early trick films were bound to a set within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, relying on long and medium shots, and adhering to the one shot = one film approach. However, there were a few films at the start of the twentieth century that dared to break these rules by introducing multiple shots.\n\nOne thing these trick films share is that they were often filmed in an interior set, with the camera fixed in a frontal proscenium position. This was common in early films, taking inspiration from the theatre and vaudeville performances. The limitation of this approach was that figures in the films only moved side-to-side and didn't walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), actors entered from the right side and moved back and forth along the horizontal axis, without the camera following them.\n\nAnother commonality was the use of long and medium shots, with close-ups never being used. This style was taken from theatre and vaudeville traditions, where the audience saw the entire performance within the stage's borders. Actors didn't move towards the camera, so close-ups weren't used.\n\nMost of these early trick films followed the pattern of one conceptual shot equaling one film, which kept their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also limited their use in storytelling, focusing more on short vaudeville-style tricks. However, in trick films, one conceptual shot didn't equate to one physical shot. A single “shot” could actually be several joined together to create illusions of apparition or disappearance. For instance, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), a closer look reveals that the physical shot with Mary’s severed \"head\" begins, even though the film is conceptually one shot in the viewer's eyes.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republicanism. Although primarily an agriculturalist, his career in politics instilled in him a strong commitment to personal freedom and government, making him vocal on these matters. His dedication to an agrarian system shaped his views on sovereignty, constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique chance to establish an ideal system, as there was no native tradition to obstruct the government's creation. He held strong convictions about the natural rights of man, which he thought were interdependent, meaning if one was denied, all would fail, and the value of what remained would be diminished. These rights, in his view, should be beyond the government's reach.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor thought a government must account for the inherent good and evil within people. He was firm in his dualistic morality, claiming, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He defined good principles as those that protected private property, improved agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. A government founded on these principles would function equitably, he believed, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by avarice and self-interest. He saw self-interest as a natural trait that only became evil when it led to the creation of sub-societies at the expense of others. A good government would retain man's natural evil but must be carefully watched to prevent the addition of bad principles.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, calling for an extremely limited Federal government with only the rights and powers explicitly stated in the Constitution. He understood that an extensive Federal government could be expensive and despotic, but he also believed a simple, literal interpretation was dangerous. Without considering the intent of the writers, it could easily become corrupt. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "So, referring back to Figure 17, we saw a noticeable drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of our project. It was somewhat disheartening, and it's tricky to pinpoint the exact cause. The onset of winter in New England means fewer people commute by bike or on foot, which could account for some of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester, when everyone is busy wrapping up schoolwork and grades. The commuter log might have just slipped off their radar. Additionally, the holiday season can take a toll, with a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus. Classes resume for the spring semester in late January, which might also contribute to the low log submissions for that month. However, none of this really explains the low February numbers. It's also possible that any project like this experiences an initial burst of excitement that naturally tapers off. To combat this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which did increase log submissions for that month. So one of the challenges we faced was maintaining project momentum despite these natural decreases and the holidays/semester breaks inherent in higher education.\n\nAnother challenge is the deeply ingrained culture of driving cars. People value the freedom, independence, and flexibility it provides. Thus, it's crucial to provide compelling incentives for alternative commuting. We handed out gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, an independent bookstore, and even some national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see if larger prizes like a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car could boost participation. The nature of the prizes didn't change throughout the project, but perhaps varying the value over time could have helped. The gift cards seemed sufficient at the start, but if we had announced additional bigger prizes in December and January, like bicycles and hybrid/electric cars, participation might have increased instead of decreasing.",
            "So, ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, are like securities that aim to mirror an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, but trade on exchanges like stocks. They offer the benefits of diversification, like index funds, plus the perks of single stock ownership, such as short selling, margin buying, and purchasing shares in any quantity. While these advantages are appealing, ETFs have costs just like mutual funds, with the added expense of trade commissions. One of the best things about ETFs is the wide variety of choices. However, it's always wise for investors to assess whether these claimed benefits, like diversification, truly exist and how significantly they impact performance. Let's dive into the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings to see if owning one ETF is as beneficial as owning a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks.\n\nFor simplicity, we'll only consider the top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF. Here they are:\n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF, we'll use their current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to calculate their contributions to portfolio Beta and Return. The results are as follows:\n\nFrom the chart, it's clear that a portfolio of just the top ten holdings offers a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, a 16% boost, with a lower Beta of 0.12. It seems that a portfolio of these top ten stocks could provide better returns with less risk. However, we need to check if the means of these two portfolios are statistically different.\n\nTo determine this, we'll examine the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, and compare their total standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "So, Edgar Allan Poe had this poem called \"Dream-Land,\" which he considered one of his better works. In this piece, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced back to Virgil. Virgil mentioned Thulé in his writings, describing it as an island north of Britain, marking the edge of the known world for the Greeks. While Virgil did use the term, there's a more recent source that Poe might have been influenced by: Goethe.\n\nThis connection is important because it shows Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" pointed out the similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, suggesting that Poe was likely emulating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a renowned writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Goethe's death, 1832. Within the second part of Faust, there's a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. After her passing, he becomes consumed by grief and drinking, eventually deciding to end his life. He gives his possessions to his children, keeps the goblet, walks to a cliff, throws it into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies.\n\nThe king in \"The King of Thule\" and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, mirroring a dark doppelganger of Poe's loss and his drinking habit. The romantic drama based on Faust, created by H. P. Grattan in 1842, was published just a year before Poe's use of the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his collected works. He uses \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and in \"Dream-Land,\" using the term as bookends for the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule as dark, lonely, and haunted by dead friends, seeing a shaded world without color. These scenes echo the themes from \"The King of Thule,\" where the king is overcome with grief, loneliness, and a loss of will to live.\n\nGoethe was a notable author whom Poe would have known, not just for his connection to Tennyson but also because of the many reproductions of his work following the original publications.",
            "So under California law, let's break it down. Could a customer injured from slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store get punitive damages by proving the store manager acted with malice? Maybe. To make this case stick, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, would need to show that the manager, Paul Martin, was aware of the risk of harm and still chose to ignore it. She can point out that multiple previous incidents occurred due to unaddressed spills and that Martin knew this. His actions, such as not cleaning the spill while he was eating, could be seen as despicable, but less so than the fact that he ignored repeated requests to clean up. The judge is unlikely to dismiss her case outright, but it might face challenges in proving that Martin's actions were truly malicious and not just negligent.\n\nOn that fateful day, October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee alerted Martin about the applesauce spill, but he was on a dinner break and didn't want to deal with it. Another employee tried again at 5:15 pm, but Martin gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, resulting in a serious back injury. Palmer is now suing for damages, and we are considering whether to file a motion to dismiss part of her claim. To recover punitive damages in California, one must show the defendant acted with oppression, fraud, or malice. For malice, conduct must have been intended to cause harm or, if not intended, it must be despicable and committed with a willful disregard for others' rights. The judge might find that Martin's actions were maliciously indifferent to the safety of others, but this claim might be tough to prove.",
            "Well, almost four years back, I took a course on Islam over at CBC. One of the major points of contention in that class was the question of whether or not Islam is inherently hostile. Funny thing is, I think that debate's even more pertinent today than it was then. Looking back on the world since 9/11, I've noticed a shift in the mass media's stance on Islam and extremists—from outright hostility to a near-worshipping tolerance. I mean, can you imagine, in 2001, having a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his clear Muslim roots?\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has always intrigued me. The more I've learned about his history, the more I'm struck by how his life doesn't quite match the image portrayed in the biography. From what I've known and studied before, I always thought Muhammad was the type to use force to convert people to Islam—conquering tribes and imposing his religion on them. But according to the biography, he's written as a sort of martyr, misunderstood and humbled. It's like, one by one, people started seeking him out. Huh, that's quite different from my previous understanding.\n\nThere are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad. The most notable one is the multiplication of mutton and milk to feed forty men. This style of storytelling makes me believe they were trying to elevate Muhammad to this humble, truth-living prophet who didn't need to prove his points through miracles. It's like they're stealing Jesus's thunder, making Muhammad seem like a basically perfect, Christ-like figure. That rubs me the wrong way.\n\nThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that seem to serve as some sort of proof of 'witnesses' converting to Islam on their own. Trouble is, these stories often come from third-party sources—like, \"So-and-so heard from this person who heard from that person.\" I don't like this because, while their intention might be to validate the stories through hearsay, it just makes the stories seem even more dubious.\n\nThe thing that bugs me the most is how they try to portray Muhammad as this godly, humble, endearing, and wise figure. History, however, tells a different story. It's like they're trying to whitewash Muhammad's rise to power. I can't help but think if Muslims today are aware of the real history behind their prophet.",
            "Well, the teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly forgotten when Christianity began to develop beyond his life. If we look at the big picture, Christianity seems to have been drifting farther and farther from its roots. Today's world shows a growing trend of progressive thinking, but tradition-holding individuals may not be enough to steer the whole. Among Christians, a deeper historical understanding will grow in the coming years. There will be a longing to distinguish the doctrines added to Christianity over time from the original intentions of its founder. This process may take decades or even centuries, but it's inevitable: Christianity will revert to its original form. A movement will emerge, peeling away layers of doctrine, like rewinding time, until only Jesus' original message remains. When this trend reaches the United States and Europe, it will influence many to worship as if they're living during Jesus' time, following only his ideas. The church will remain strong, leading the way, but the diversity of beliefs and practices will lessen, with similarities replacing differences among regions, denominations, and divisions. History is full of reversals. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire but later, the empire itself became Christian. Our country has seen African-American slavery turn into African-American leadership. The future of Christianity will follow this pattern, undoing history to find its source and reducing diversity. A vital part of this process will be interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. So, what has changed since Jesus' time?",
            "I hold that \"The Jungle\" reveals how at our core, humans are inherently greedy and selfish. Our chief concern is to make our own lives as comfortable and prosperous as possible, but we pay no heed to those beneath us. The novel illustrates this through the factory owners and managers who are solely focused on expanding their empires. They are unmoved by the harm caused by their operations, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" a vivid description of the environmental devastation. They show no concern for the workers or the animals who suffer due to the factories' emissions and waste. The owners' sole goal is profit, exemplified by their exploitation of employees: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They push workers to their limits, laying off mass numbers without notice or compensation. In that period, few laws or protections existed for workers, allowing managers to run rampant. The book suggests that those who perished in Packingtown were expected to endure the miserable conditions without aid or escape. Organizations to assist workers were scarce, and unions often exacerbated the plight of the workers by lining their pockets at the workers' expense. The workers were trapped in a system that treated them like slaves, as \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "Many authors employ various techniques to evoke specific feelings or perspectives in their readers regarding important subjects. Some techniques work better than others. In his novel The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald uses several of these methods. Often, he couples adjectives and nouns in unusual ways to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. Alternatively, he assigns meaning to symbols and then utilizes them for this purpose. Fitzgerald employs this latter technique with numerous colors, such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald constructs a particular significance for white/gray and red/pink colors, which he later employs to engender specific associations with significant subjects.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald assigns to white/gray is uniformity, with white symbolizing a higher social status and gray denoting older, faded elements. This is evident early in the novel, as characters are frequently depicted in white. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as “in white” (8), and even Nick wears “white flannels” (41) at Gatsby’s party. Only when Nick describes Gatsby’s party does he mention other colors, such as “gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald reinforces this association by coloring everyday subjects in white/gray. For instance, Nick’s work commute is described as “down the white chasms of lower New York” (56), and people’s names at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61) on his schedule. Furthermore, common or unimportant characters and places are often associated with white or gray. For example, Jordan and Daisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, and there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes. Similarly, the “Italian child” on the train is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is a “gray old man” (27).\n\nLater, Fitzgerald uses these colors to convey a sense of uniformity or unimportance around significant subjects, particularly through his portrayal of Daisy. After a prolonged period without notable mentions of either color, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in a “little white roadster,” making her seem less like a character and more like a mere addition to Gatsby’s pursuits (74). He further uses this technique to depict Daisy as a uniform addition, for example, with a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",
            "San Diego County, with its mild and sunny climate, is a hotspot for agriculture. Tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers are common crops. The demand for organic, community-supported agriculture is substantial, with many local organizations boasting long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also quite popular. Some organic farms offer tours of their operations and provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This setup allows landowners to benefit from government programs while also enhancing habitat, offering recreational use, and generating income through tours and educational programs.",
            "Culture, it's a thing that's crucial in any negotiation. It's not just a single, uniform thing, but it's made up of what it isn't and what it stands for too. It's not all the same everywhere, and it's not a static thing either. So saying things like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" is too broad. It's better to understand how the culture of the people you're dealing with affects the negotiation, especially if you're from a different culture. When you're dealing with a foreign culture, you'll naturally compare it to your own, but that's okay. Understanding a culture involves more than just learning its history, it's about understanding its prejudices too. Instead of judging or trying to change them, you just need to accept them and work within their boundaries, especially if you're at a disadvantage in the negotiation. If you're on \"home turf,\" respecting their traditions and beliefs can help you get past any cultural barriers and move things forward.\n\nCulture isn't just about national or international differences. Even within the same country, companies can have their own unique cultures. For example, some companies might emphasize long hours, while others might have a more relaxed schedule. You can see these differences in things like employee dress codes, how they communicate, and how they hire people. Some companies encourage philanthropy at all levels, while others only do it through \"company approved\" charities. Just look at American corporate culture to see how diverse it is. Even within a single company, there can be different cultures based on location or environment. Some cultures may seem more uniform, but that's just the surface. You need to look deeper to understand them.\n\nValues are key because they tell you why a culture is the way it is. If saving face or communal harmony is important, a negotiator won't publicly humiliate their company or their boss to win. Likewise, if a negotiator comes from a culture that favors tough bargaining, they won't rush to settle early. Understanding these generalities before the negotiation is important, but it's also good to know something about your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "So the fool in his heart once proclaimed, \"There is no God.\" This notion is first seen in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and also stands at the center of St. Anselm’s argument for God's existence. This view is also echoed by another author we'll discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Since both arguments are aimed at proving the same divine entity, specifically the God of the Bible, let's start by assuming they are both correct in their belief. To compare their arguments effectively, we must assume they are discussing the same God. So, while each of them offers valid points, neither presents a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nSt. Anselm’s approach begins with faith, emphasizing that understanding God requires looking within oneself. He argues that since God exists within our minds, we cannot imagine his nonexistence. This idea, while somewhat complicated, posits that proof of God's existence lies within our own consciousness. St. Anselm suggests we don't need external evidence to find truth about God; it's inherently within our minds. This is often referred to as faith in Christian teachings.\n\nThomas Aquinas, however, takes a different stance. He believes God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without needing faith. This argument is advantageous for evangelism, as it can persuade converts without relying on their willingness to accept unprovable faith. St. Thomas presents five logical arguments to support his claim: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument demonstrates that the need for God is logically necessary, even without direct observation.\n\nIn essence, Aquinas argues that logical deductions can prove God's existence, much like knowing a missing puzzle piece's features without seeing it.",
            "Long ago, around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would later be known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned the world and achieved enlightenment, giving birth to the teachings that would become Buddhism, with its most traditional branch being known as Theravada Buddhism. This religion has been around for about 2500 years, and it has evolved significantly since Buddha's time. You can see these changes in various places, such as in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where an annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Monks and laypeople alike participate in this event, which has some religious significance, even though Buddha never taught about such a festivity.\n\nThe changes in Buddhism over time can be seen in both its superficial traditions and its core beliefs. The Theravada Buddhist community, whether from a monastic or lay perspective, has had to adjust its doctrinal principles over the years due to both internal and external factors, as well as hostile and benign influences. To better understand this discussion, let's define some key terms. Internal forces refer to influences coming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of one's status, while external forces refer to influences from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are any that aim to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often stemming from negative perceptions of Buddhism. Benign forces, on the other hand, do not intend to harm or help the community but may do so indirectly.\n\nTo delve into the basics of Theravada Buddhism, we must first explore its core doctrinal principles. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the metaphysical components of Buddhism, such as Anatta (no self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). By recognizing these concepts, one can escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and along with it, lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), ultimately achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets rules for life, with laypeople following five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances), while monks follow many more disciplinary rules. The fundamental doctrine in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths: first, that life is suffering (Dukkha); second, that attachment is the cause of suffering; third, that suffering can be overcome; and fourth, the path to the end of suffering.",
            "So, let me tell you a story about two nations, the United States of America and Mexico. They had a long-standing rivalry that lasted for a whopping 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the U.S. attacked and conquered Mexico, gaining Texas and the American Southwest as new territory. There were many other skirmishes between them, which finally softened just before the First World War.\n\nTheir rivalry started over key issues like religion, culture, and tradition, with a significant clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31). It's not unlike many other nations that have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor; nations sharing a border often have conflicting interests, leading to rivalries. The U.S. and Mexico are no different. David M. Pletcher (1977) put it this way, “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).\n\nReligious differences were a huge rift between them, similar to many nations throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) stated, “if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy” (p.86). This ideological struggle was not about political structure but religious preferences. The distrust between the United States and Mexico stemmed from the distrust between the English and Spanish, which was passed down from their colonial rulers. This lingering mistrust made it difficult to establish friendly foreign relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) listed 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these disputes were about territorial issues, like border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a significant issue that persisted until both nations used military force to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) noted that the rivalry began to ease as Mexico became highly dependent on the United States, and it finally ended when American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico (p. 109-110) in the latter part of the 19th Century.",
            "Well, it's been a long time since I was struck with a sudden and unforeseen disability, around 15 years ago. I was working as a nurse, a job I chose for a sense of security and safety that I lacked during my childhood. I kept hearing that people would always get sick, so I figured nursing was a safe bet. Even though my heart yearned for a career in science or journalism, the security of a consistent job was too appealing to pass up.\n\nBut life had other plans. At 46, I found myself unable to work, my body broken by an illness I never saw coming. My savings were dwindling, and after 15 long years of relying on Social Security Disability, I have little left to call my own. Every day is a struggle, a constant assault on my security and self-esteem. I am reminded daily that nothing in life is certain, yet I know I've made it this far only because of the support of my family and a few good friends. Alone, I'd be lost.\n\nMy message is clear: life is unpredictable. There will always be challenges, and no amount of preparation can shield you from everything. Sure, we should be wise and self-reliant, but the American spirit was not built on rugged individualism alone. It was built on compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources. People didn't conquer the Rockies by going it alone; they did it together.\n\nSo, while I have a disaster kit and supplies, I also encourage you to build relationships with your neighbors. Trust, compassion, and mutual aid are the foundations of any strong community. Let's learn to help each other and ask for help when we need it, rather than isolating ourselves. After all, no one can go it alone forever.",
            "Why do organisms evolve the way they do? Are there limitations or factors that influence the trajectory of evolutionary change? While D’Arcy Thompson in 1917 said, “Even now the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,” the same can be said today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny, as seen in studies like Raup and Stanley's work in 1981. Our research explores how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, in conjunction with experimental studies, can help understand the mechanisms behind the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. Using X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies with software like CerioShell. These models help interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum, and the results are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to better grasp macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that extends over time through 360 degrees of space. These turns in the shell's spiral are called whorls, which revolve around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which whorls enlarge can vary, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl, called the body whorl, is the last one. The spire is the part of the shell without the body whorl, with the apex at the top and the base at the bottom. The animal's exit from the shell is through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles—apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, first, view the shell from the apical side to locate the first suture, then draw a line dividing the shell. Count whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and the horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formula is established, parameters can be varied and modified to alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "For the past decade, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have remained quite stable. Although the country has made progress towards many Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, the progress on child and maternal health indicators is lagging considerably, making it challenging to achieve the 2015 targets. The reasons for these shortcomings are multifaceted and suggest that strengthening the overall health system is a more pressing need than focusing on specific programmatic interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% of births now meeting this standard. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot provide medical interventions during complicated pregnancies, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate due to hemorrhage. This indicates that while progress has been made, there is still significant work to be done in this area. Additionally, there has been a decrease in the percentage of diarrhea cases in children under five years treated by a healthcare professional, and postnatal care remains a concern with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain relatively low at around 4%, with only 2% in rural areas compared to 7% in urban areas. This highlights a severe issue of healthcare access disparity across the country, with services concentrated in urban areas. Furthermore, there is a significant gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, with a 27% difference, indicating that the poor have greater difficulty accessing healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal health indicators, the primary question is how best to address the lack of service. Should Indonesia focus on developing program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without concentrating on pre- and post-pregnancy care? While programmatic approaches offer targeted and manageable objectives with faster results, they also come with significant drawbacks. Investing heavily in one area can lead to insufficient funding for other sectors and may result in human resources being drawn to better-resourced programs. Running multiple parallel programs without coordination can also lead to duplication of services and increased administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are known for their intricate detail and focus on the aristocracy of the era. Two notable Victorian works that break from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels incorporate an element of mystery and an unconventional twist, which enriches their characters and deepens our understanding of their motivations and emotions. In Oliver Twist, for instance, such elements are often revealed through dream sequences or dreamlike states. These strange occurrences often shed light on Oliver’s inner turmoil, his awareness of his surroundings, and the true nature of events around him. When Oliver revisits the shooting of himself in chapter 28, he experiences it as if in a dream, grappling to find help. The passage emphasizes Oliver’s lack of control over the unfolding events and the dire state of his health, evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself numbs all his senses, and he doesn’t notice the “unseen hand” that carries him away. He relives his despair removed from the initial shock of pain, now constant and linked with fear. This shooting underscores Oliver’s inability to take control of his circumstances, even when his life is at stake. It suggests a growing sense of defeat, as if Fagin has broken him, forcing him to accept his despair and influencing his ability to react. It is implied that Oliver would have made some effort to save his life had he not been overwhelmed by his circumstances.",
            "A couple of years back, I was part of an after-school program where I tutored elementary age students. I did my best to assist them in any subjects they were struggling with, but my strengths lay in English and reading. One particular student, Adrian, needed help with reading and it quickly became apparent that something wasn't right. He could read perfectly, but he had peculiar difficulties with certain letters. It didn't make sense; he spoke perfect English, but the problem was that he didn't know the English alphabet well. One day, his mother arrived. She spoke only Spanish, and even with my limited Spanish, we managed to communicate. That's when I realized Adrian's issue; he could read, but he didn't know the English alphabet. I'm not sure if that revelation helped him, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the challenge of language barriers in schools, especially in California. It shows that even when a child speaks perfect English, reading can still be a hurdle. I believe we all agree this is an issue, so what can we do about it? For Adrian, the solution was straightforward: he needed tutoring in English reading, especially the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for many children who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none of these alone can solve the problem. The key is to combine all these methods!\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a great idea, not just for Spanish-speaking children, but for all kids. Studies show that children in these programs outperform their peers academically. However, there's a lot of fear surrounding this idea, that it's a waste of resources. That's not true. If we implemented these programs in all classrooms, all children would benefit. How do we do it? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's unrealistic. But we can certainly have bilingual aids or tutors to assist.",
            "From the time we are kids, we're often told there's something larger than ourselves, something we can't comprehend. Some of us are taught about it in Sunday school, others in temples, or we look within ourselves for answers. Many of us just accept what our parents believed, while some reject it and believe in nothing beyond our own egocentric universe. We may adopt one value system, then change our minds later. Whatever path we choose, we define a part of ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives. We seek a light to guide us out of the darkness and into the sun.\n\n\"Cardinals,\" my dad said when I asked him about his favorite bird.

I hugged him, moved my chair closer, and watched the rain with him.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation didn't ease his suffering, but kept him alive a few months longer. I couldn't watch him leave this life. I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not how he died. I curled up and waited for the news.\n\nNo one called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in essence, an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt puts it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both criticized and celebrated, accused of lacking depth and praised for its 'terrible sublime' effect (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined ideas from \"ancient and modern\" romances to establish the Gothic genre and a new mode of literary expression. Walpole used \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to create what he termed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre incorporates numerous throwbacks to medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. When The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated. The blend of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing for a more personal view of characters' psychology) has kept Gothic relevant for centuries, making it both obsolete and fresh for readers far removed from its original period.\n\nOne prominent Gothic theme found in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is crucial to Gothic writers because it represents the classic knight—brave, honorable, and competent—while also highlighting their perceived lack of these qualities in contemporary society. By employing chivalric concepts and mannerisms, the \"Gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the genre's future evolution into Romanticism. Walpole, writing during a politically tumultuous period and grappling with unfair accusations, may have begun to question the morality and innate \"goodness\" of people, as compared to the supposed ideals of the Gothic era. This notion is evident in several characters, including Frederic. Before meeting Frederic, the reader learns that he embodies many chivalric traits. He is described as:\n\nThe description includes numerous traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently thought to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course, exaggerated, bringing into play the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "So, another month has slipped by, and as usual, my life remains pretty much status quo. Nothing much has happened, except for a few things worth mentioning. I finally wrapped up the beta version of the tradenet website, though it took a while. I kept adding and improving it. I'm planning to register a domain and get the site up and running by the middle of January 04. The delay was mainly due to a lack of funds and a means to transfer it to the web hosting company. My partner will get his credit card in January, so we'll set up the site then. And how could I forget the other big thing? I flunked accounting. I knew it was coming from the moment I left the exam hall, I just flunked with 47 out of 100. I don't know, is it worse to fail knowing you're close to passing or to fail badly? I'm guessing the former. Well, since it's borderline, I put in an appeal to the course coordinator. I don't expect much, but at least there's hope.

            "Another month has come and gone, and I'll be honest, my life has been on the stagnant side. No major events, except for a few things I'll mention. I've finally completed the beta version of the tradenet website, after much delay, and plans to get the site up and running by mid-January 04. The hold-up is due to lack of funds and a means to transfer the website to a web hosting company. My partner will get his credit card in January, so then we'll set it up. And there's another significant event that happened. I flunked accounting. Oh no. I knew it was coming, from the moment I left the exam hall. I scored 47 out of 100. Not sure if it's worse to flunk knowing you were so close, or to flunk badly. I'm guessing the former. I've appealed the grade, not expecting much but at least there's hope. On the bright side, I got distinctions in law and economics. Maybe it's because I like the course, so I'm more motivated. But then again, if you like a course, it's probably because it's easy to understand. Catch 22 situation. I'll find out the appeal result this week. On the brighter side, nothing much else happened. Guess that's it for now. Till next time.",
            "Duke Ellington's impact in jazz music is largely due to his longevity and the creative prowess he brought to his orchestra. His presence on the piano, while subtle in many compositions, showcases his ability to craft rich and intricate pieces that highlight the unique talents of his band members. Ellington designed a framework that allowed for soloists to freely improvise, while also writing tightly orchestrated sections that emphasized the individual styles of his musicians, creating harmonious and original sounds for each piece. His mastery of each player's sound, along with how they blended together in a growing ensemble, allowed him to compose some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's sound and innovation, mentioning his use of voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This is evident in his early piece, Creole Love Call, where Ellington uses voice to add texture and color without lyrics. Here, the voice complements the styles of his soloists, a trait that persists throughout his career. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses, each with a unique call and response between voice and reeds, showcasing Ellington's ability to create a rich tapestry of sound.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a complementary sound. This piece, like many of Ellington’s works, showcases his ability to blend different musical styles and instruments seamlessly. In It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing), Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's unique sound on muted trombone to great effect in introducing the melody.\n\nEllington’s use of voice to add a layer of tone color to his pieces is just one example of his stylistic brilliance that runs throughout his career.",
            "She had always felt a void, a desire that remained unfulfilled. At 14, she started to crave something, and at 17, it was still there. She had figured out she wanted a person, not an object, but she couldn't find any appeal in the boys who showed interest. She questioned her strange condition, yet nothing she theorized seemed satisfactory. So, she carried on, wondering about her desires.\n\nPeace was usually the norm at home. Her parents were calm and never argued much, except when she pushed her boundaries. They were a laid-back couple, but she balanced them with her fun-loving personality, making her quite charming.\n\nToday, however, was different. As she wandered around, searching for inspiration, she heard her mother's scream from the kitchen. She rushed in to find her mother on the ground, hurting. \"Mom! What's wrong?\" she asked, panicking. Her mom was in severe pain, and she directed her daughter to take her to the hospital. The daughter, grateful for her strength training, carried her mother to the car and drove to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the scent of disinfectant and sickness, but she was focused on helping her mother. After handing her over to the doctors, she sat worriedly, waiting for news.\n\nHer mother had fallen off a stepladder while reaching for a high cabinet.",

            "Well, 2007 was a year when the United States of America was hit by a severe financial crisis. Unemployment soared, the housing market collapsed, and many of the nation's major corporations were left in shambles. This economic downturn is still ongoing today, so we must ask: how did this crisis come about, and how can we prevent it from happening again? In essence, the financial crisis was caused by self-centered and naive political decisions that pushed banks and firms to offer sub-prime loans, which were sold to an immature and underdeveloped financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to back and package these mortgages into CDOs and CDS'. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks found themselves short on capital reserves and transferred this turmoil to the repacked mortgages they had sold, and eventually to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe origins of this financial crisis can be traced back to 1999 during the Clinton administration. The President was aiming for a second term and sought to boost his popularity, which led to the relaxation of lending restrictions. This paved the way for the sub-prime crisis just seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999 reported, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest mortgage underwriter, faced increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income people, while also feeling pressure from shareholders to maintain its remarkable growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: \"However, the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, necessitating a government rescue similar to that of the Savings and Loan industry in the 1980s.\" As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foretold, imprudent lending would indeed lead to the economy’s collapse.\n\nSeveral factors combined to push the economy into a tailspin, with one being the complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs were widely used in the years before the crisis, further intertwining various economic sectors with the housing market. This overleveraged the U.S. households and financial markets in the housing sector, leaving them highly susceptible to even minor price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which represented about 30% of the USA's GDP. Eventually, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to stringent regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That part of your tale where you flex your writer's muscles and soar, dazzling your readers with your enchanting prose. Or the section where your audience nods off and hits the \"Back\" button, cursing your name. Dr. Merlin herself has caught herself shouting at her screen when she's wading through Too Much Information, and not in the interesting way.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still finds herself tripping over long passages where nothing substantial occurs, or worse, too much detail. Exposition is that little imp on your shoulder telling you to rush through the history to get to the good stuff (not to be confused with the imp on the other shoulder pushing to tell your audience every last detail of your characters' backstories).\n\nExposition means laying out what happened, typically in straightforward language. In film, the exposition happens when one character shares a laundry list of information with another, like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the sharing.\n\nConsider this: while reading a story, you're told something like, \"The heroine met her beloved at such a time and place, they were wed in a grand event, and he was murdered in front of her eyes.\" You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to consume two pages, during which both characters exchange only a couple of lines. You'd expect the author to spend time on the husband's character, revealing through his dialogue and actions how deeply he loved his wife, and you'd likewise expect the heroine to show through both big and small ways how his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story later says her love was profound). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to feel his loss as she does and would give you insight into the heroine's life: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as seen through his eyes, and so on. You'd mourn his death with her, and so grow more invested in the heroine herself.\n\nIn essence, you need to provide the substance that brings the story to life. Sometimes it's tempting to hurry through certain aspects. Maybe you're introducing a new character and you know he was in the Air Force, is the night manager of a gas station now, divorced twice, no kids, loves fishing on weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and",
            "Yesterday, I caught two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first one, aired live on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011), discussed a disturbing incident in Ashley, Ohio. The story involved a man named Shad Hostettler who had stabbed his wife; they didn't mention her name, but the mug shot they showed looked chilling. They dedicated only about two minutes to the developing story, which, I believe, was appropriate. The second story, featuring an early morning shooting in Sharon Woods, involved Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old who had been critically injured. There were no arrests at the time, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story was brief, and I suspect that might have been due to the fact that it involved a person of color. I've noticed over the years that crimes against minorities often don't receive as much attention as they deserve. The next story was about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, which was believed to have been caused by a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. Following that, they reported on the predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. This segment was brief, but it served as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in. They also covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, where a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt had been involved. They devoted an unusual amount of time to emphasize his race and the fact that he was tall and weighed around 150 pounds. Lastly, they mentioned a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin named Rene Rodriguez, who had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. They also noted his Hispanic background, which, in my opinion, was not relevant to the story.",
            "The bond between brothers is a unique and unyielding connection, filled with a myriad of emotions—love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty among others. Brothers understand each other in a way no one else can, and they often see their own reflection in their sibling. This bond is most apparent in dire situations, where its true nature emerges, be it for better or worse. The emotions that form from this fraternal link come with a significant price. Understanding these emotions means also accepting the consequences they bring. When you look into your brother's eyes, you see yourself as you truly are, not as others perceive you. It is in their actions and the aftermath of those actions that their genuine character is revealed. This theme is vividly explored in “The Scarlet Ibis,” where two brothers embark on a doomed journey, navigating through a lush landscape. The story is rich with Doodle's direct characterization and his interactions with his older brother, as well as with the narrator's perspective, which provides insight into the complex emotions and actions of both characters.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single emotion: pride. From the time he first goes out with Doodle to their final, tragic excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his younger brother. He yearned for a companion he could teach all his skills, such as holding his breath, running, and climbing trees, as well as someone to race with and perch with in the tallest pine. However, Doodle's frail heart made it unlikely he would ever participate in such activities. This placed a heavy burden on the protagonist, whose dreams were dashed in an instant. This realization even led him to contemplate harming Doodle, illustrating the depth of his resentment. Yet, his heart softened when Doodle simply smiled at him, showing that his initial intentions were not truly evil. The smile gave the protagonist hope, highlighting his underlying love for his brother, despite his initial resentment.",
            "The human brain, an intricate and imaginative information processor, has seen its metaphors evolve with technological progress. From a wax tablet to a computer, these metaphors help us understand the brain but can also lead to misconceptions. Information begins as sensory inputs, transforming physical stimuli like touch, warmth, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. These signals are processed through algorithms, both bottom-up and top-down. For instance, when you see a black box on white paper, bottom-up processing combines simple details like color and edge borders to recognize it as a box. Top-down processing then speeds up your recognition by using prior decisions. The brain's attention filter sorts information's importance, deciding which cognitive processes to prioritize. For example, while walking, you might notice your name in a noisy room, ignoring individual blades of grass. This processing involves multiple stages, modulated by attention.\n\nInformation storage is crucial for the brain. There are various types of memory, such as sensory, working, and long-term. Encoding involves converting sensory inputs into different types of information, like structural, phonetic, or semantic. Working memory, with a brief storage period, is maintained by electrical signals looping through specific neurons. Long-term memory is believed to rely on specific protein structures. Multiple models organize knowledge in the brain, ranging from human memory retrieval to computer science and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes nodes representing concepts linked by their relatedness, such as \"chair\" linked to \"table\" and \"wooden\"",
            "Aldous Huxley voices concern over the looming threat of technology and capitalistic systems, creating a dystopian society in Brave New World. The citizenry prioritizes community over individualism and is conditioned from birth to chase happiness at all costs. They are pawns in a larger scheme controlled by the World Controller, who dictates their ideology. Examining the novel through a Marxist lens reveals Huxley's skepticism about these emerging systems, using terms like homogenization and reification to highlight its flaws.\n\nCapitalism is critiqued through the concept of false consciousness. The common folks are kept unaware of their true economic relations, focusing instead on self-interest. This is achieved through the proletariat's ideological control, evident in Brave New World's conditioning. The common classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, lack free will and are driven to consume and indulge. This manipulation is orchestrated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where social classes are dominated by a separate group, is clear. The lower classes are unaware of manipulation, being \"sold on an ideology that upholds the structure\" (capitalism and consumerism). Even the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, accept their status, with few exceptions like Bernard. The societal interactions reveal the oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships are shallow. Characters lack depth, even among major figures. Huxley might suggest that technology and capitalism rob individuals of free will and expression. Love doesn't exist, nor intense emotions; interactions are superficial. Males comment on females' physical appearance, and females discuss their encounters casually. Each societal class' complacency with their role indicates capitalism's socioeconomic effects. Their unquestioning obedience signifies Marxist thought, where the proletariat are made to believe they are superior as long as they consume and adhere to their peers.",
            "Well, I've been hanging out at University Park for nearly two and a half years now, which adds up to four semesters. Navigating the campus can be a real pain, especially for freshmen. My first year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, pretty much at the farthest point east on campus. Just getting to classes in places like Willard building could take up to 25 minutes on foot, and that's not counting the bad weather we usually get in State College. Turns out, not too long ago, East Halls were isolated from the rest of the campus by vast empty spaces. Now, those have been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services center, and apartments. As campus keeps growing, it's getting harder to get around. So, what's the best solution to the campus commute conundrum? Bikes are the way to go.\n\nMy buddy just started riding again after a long break, and he's loving it. “Bikes are awesome,” he says, “they're the only way to get around.” Besides being good for your body, they're the most efficient mode of transport. A bowl of oats and a little workout can cover 30 miles no problem. I, too, live off campus, about as far from the center as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was getting a bike. Thomas building, where I have class every day, is a 25-minute walk from my place. On my bike, that time cuts to 5 minutes. The only downside is Pollock Road, the fastest route to Thomas, isn't always a smooth ride. Still, walking takes too much time, especially when you're as busy as I am. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option. Walking to Thomas would add 30-40 minutes each day, and that's over two and a half hours a week. Let's not forget the extra time for other classes, appointments, and so on. That's a lot of time I can't spare."
