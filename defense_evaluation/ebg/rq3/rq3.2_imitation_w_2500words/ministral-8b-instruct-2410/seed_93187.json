            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In my quest to become a social worker, I aim to focus on the Division of Family and Children Services. My goal is to support children who have been abused or neglected and offer assistance to troubled families. The values I bring to this field are service, respect, an ethical nature, and a commitment to improving relationships and my own professional competence. These values are not just beneficial to the social work field; they are integral to my personal being.\n\nI've always had a strong desire to help others, but I was uncertain about the career path I wanted to take. Throughout high school and college, I observed many individuals dodging their problems and employing subpar coping mechanisms. Witnessing these situations led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Even after graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I was still uncertain about my career. During a summer break, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. He was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I found out he had called the police to his parents' residence. I drove over to help and privately explained my concerns to the police. They requested that I speak with the parents, as there was nothing the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and blamed their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outsiders. This experience made me consider a career in social work to help children with \"simple\" family disputes.\n\nAnother crucial value for social work is social justice. While society claims to value each individual, the concept of “the individual” is often more aligned with traditional norms than actual uniqueness. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and refuse to limit myself to be like others. Throughout my schooling, I protested against social injustice: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, piercing my ears beyond the norm, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and fighting against racism and discrimination. I stand for social justice and will continue to protest against social injustice.",
            "So, this paper dives into the Biological and Sociocultural models concerning the disorder insomnia. The biological model zooms in on genetic info passed down, as well as the medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models, on the other hand, explore environmental relationships and their implications on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review examines insomnia through these models, breaking down each piece of research related to them and explaining it better. We’ll also critique the research findings and point out their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to another mental disorder, or sleep disorders due to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders linked to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other sleep disorders can stem from medical complications or substance use. Dyssomnias, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, each have their specific characteristics. Primary Insomnia, for instance, is a struggle with adequate or maintained sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is difficulty staying awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Meanwhile, Parasomnias, like Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder, are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder deal with sleep difficulties caused by Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). Our review focuses mainly on insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, inherited factors, and the physiological aspects of these disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, are crucial for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice found specific GABAB receptors on orexin neurons that regulate sleep and wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor, which is inhibited by baclofen, can increase sleep time. This suggests that animal models like mice can be generalized to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for GABAB receptors in humans. If these receptors are impaired, adequate sleep without medication could be affected. The sociocultural implication is that inherited phenotypes could naturally regulate sleep, and alterations in these receptors could disturb sleep, negatively impacting daily life, including school, career, and monotonous tasks.",
            "This article takes a look at three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, it provides a brief definition of the condition, describing it as a problem with the efficiency and effectiveness of how the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. In simpler terms, it’s a disorder where the brain struggles to properly process sounds we hear, even though the ears are functioning normally. People with CAPD can hear just fine, but the part of the brain responsible for separating words and filtering out background noise doesn't work as it should.\n\nThe origins of CAPD can be traced back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as “auditory imperception”. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for children with communication disorders in 1954. Kimura then introduced dichotic testing in 1961, which helped understand how the brain processes auditory information. A national conference in 1977 further sparked research on CAPD.\n\nThe disorder can manifest in various ways. A person with CAPD might have trouble pinpointing where sounds are coming from, distinguishing between different sounds, recognizing patterns, or detecting changes in speech. They may also struggle with sounds being blocked by subsequent ones, or have difficulty interpreting sounds to act upon them. Additionally, they might have trouble understanding the sequence of sounds presented to them.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a systematic observation of a patient’s listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. This can be done by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, or others using various measures. There’s no single, consistent tool for diagnosis, and the cause of CAPD is unknown. Tests often present multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask the patient to differentiate items like words or numbers. More advanced tests record acoustic signals in the ear and measure responses to them.\n\nLastly, the article concludes with ways a teacher in a mainstream classroom can assist a student with CAPD.",
            "So, Twelfth Night seems to suggest that while disguise can be handy for pulling off long deceits, at some point, you gotta drop it and return to your true self, or else you might lose yourself forever. The tricky part? When you reveal your true colors, you might find yourself all alone. Some folks won't mind being deceived, but others might take it hard. Like, really hard. At the end of the day, you gotta choose between staying true to yourself or keeping your relationships intact. Now, gender role reversal and deception is a whole different ball game. Why would someone feel the need to ditch their own identity and pretend to be someone else? In Viola's case, it's all about self-preservation. “I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) New in town and scared, Viola pretends to be a man to stay safe. Her plan works, but it cuts her off from the women in her life, leaving her isolated. To make things worse, she's so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Plus, she's dealing with Orsino's unrequited feelings: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261) Now, this might all seem progressive, but to us modern folk, it might be seen as a way to surface hidden emotions, especially for Olivia and Orsino. It's like Shakespeare is saying, hey, maybe they've got feelings they're not aware of yet. Take Olivia, for instance. Is she into Cesario because he's a man or does she secretly fancy women? Probably not, since Olivia seems more like a product of her time, judging people only by their looks. Case in point, she easily switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, treating Cesario/Viola as family instead. “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "So let's delve into the intricacies of German colonial rule. Now, I'm not saying it was all one thing. We're talking about an empire here, and empires are complex beasts. The German colonial empire was a patchwork of policies and governance, as varied as it was vast. But when it comes to education, it was a mixed bag too. In colonies like German East Africa (now Tanzania), the Brits found a literate and educated population. And in Kamerun and other colonies, the Germans got some kudos for their educational efforts. But South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) was a different story. Unlike East Africa, where the government took the reins in educating the locals, in South West Africa, it was largely left to missionary societies with meager government support. Meanwhile, the government invested heavily in European education. This had lingering effects long after German rule ended, with a vast majority of the population remaining uneducated. Social, political, and economic factors were the drivers behind this disparity. This is what I want to explore further, looking at new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere's a ton of literature out there on education in the German colonial empire. Most of it's in German and came out in the early 20th century, either during or soon after the colonial period. Early works were all about describing the educational systems in each colony. Later works in English gave us more detailed comparisons and analyses. These studies highlighted the significant differences between the educational systems. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa is a standout here. Cohen compares the two colonies and discusses the factors behind their educational differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa played a big role in shaping its educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa was moderately temperate, but much of it was arid desert. This attracted a European population—nearly 15,000 whites by 1913. In comparison, East Africa had only 5,336 settlers.",
            "The classification of popular music has evolved significantly over the past 100 years, leading us to a point where listing all the genres and sub-genres can be quite challenging. Genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, for example, have birthed numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, making it even harder to keep track. One such genre that stands out for its diversity and expressiveness is Heavy Metal rock, which has developed into a highly versatile genre over the past 40 years. It’s expressive because it covers a wide range of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker side. Its diversity is evident in the early realization that it offered ample flexibility for experimentation, leading to the creation of various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres that continue to flourish today.\n\nWe’ve reached a point where the Heavy Metal movement has spawned so many unique groups that it's almost impossible to define what Heavy Metal is. It has absorbed themes from other genres, but it has a distinct origin. To understand the metal music of today, one must first grasp what the metal movement is and why it’s considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nHeavy Metal is fundamentally a dark movement. It’s often described as a “music of more”—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. Musicians in metal bands are highly skilled, which is evident in their music. It’s also a movement deeply influenced by drug culture. The mid-70s saw a psychedelic drug boom that led to the creation of crazier, otherworldly music, often using drugs as an excuse for its unique sound. The genre possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which was a new trend at the time, as much of popular music earlier didn’t delve into the darker emotions. Later generations of metal musicians have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like the following showcase the darker side of the movement:\n\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter exhibit the darker side of the Beatles. The song is seen as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, responding to a Rolling Stone song that was also on the heavier, darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove their ability to be as heavy as the Stones, leading to the inclusion of Helter Skelter on their White Album.",
            "So a few decades before the Surrealists started painting their dreamlike masterpieces, there was Henri Rousseau, a man who was figuratively and literally crafting his own dreams. The Dream, a painting from 1910, isn't just a depiction of a woman in awe of a dream landscape; it's a reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. From the start, he dreamt of recognition, acceptance, and praise, but faced a tough internal struggle. Should he conform to existing styles to be accepted or stay true to his unique voice? The Dream captures this lifelong battle: his desire to be part of the art world versus his wish to carve his own path.\n\nTo understand The Dream, we need to know a bit about Rousseau's life. Born in Laval, France, on May 21, 1844, he was a tinsmith's son who never received formal art training. He worked as a gabelou until he was forty, earning the nickname \"douanier\" despite not being a customs inspector. After losing his first wife and many of their children, he turned to painting for solace. Unlike his peers, Rousseau was a folk painter with the hopes and dreams of the common people.\n\nRousseau's quest for acceptance is understandable given his circumstances. Uneducated and starting late, he was painting amidst more famous artists, and his recognition came around the same time as Matisse's rise. Jan Gordon, in Modern French Painters, notes that while they were rivals, they had different motivations. Matisse wanted to avoid clichés, while Rousseau wanted to create something so conventional he’d be accepted.",
            "So many great minds have posited a deep bond between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there's a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats wrote in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— / That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience. Yet, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being formally taught. Both are efforts to describe, rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty often aim to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than setting rules for good art or moral behavior. For instance, discussing da Vinci's Mona Lisa may focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these don't fully capture why it's good art. When asked about a favorite piece, people often say, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more complex explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be fully reduced to their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor put it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Ethics shares this property. As Wittgenstein said, \"Ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this elusive \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and it's this transcendental nature that connects them. I believe morality and art are so closely related because we experience them most powerfully at a noumenal level, as Kant would say. They affect us at a level we can feel but can't fully explain. This link is especially strong with literature. As McKean notes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany, as it stands today, is recognized as a potent force, a united nation with a rich culture that stretches from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This culture is tangible in cities like Cologne, in the heart of Germany, and in Dresden, a Saxon city nestled along the Elbe. Given this diverse cultural tapestry, it's not surprising that Germany, as we know it, has its roots in various sources and tribes.\n\nThe land of the Germans, known as Germania, has a contentious origin story. Some scholars believe the name came from the Germanic tribe called Tungrians, as documented by Tacitus in 98 AD, while others suggest it might come from the Old Irish word meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy. Regardless, the Romans, who first used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish conquered Gauls from unconquered Germanic tribes, would have been surprised to see the Germanic tribes living on the borders of their empire. Initially, the Romans interacted with the Germanic tribes through trade and the occasional military campaign, but mostly returned to their sprawling empire. The Germanic tribes, however, remained, and their influence continued to shape the lands they inhabited.",
            "Staring down, I blankly took in the sight before me. My mind was unemotionally processing the view, silently analyzing it with a practiced precision that refused to relate the object to any abstract understanding. Thoughts flitted in and out of my consciousness almost too quickly to notice. It was as if I was experiencing the scene rather than thinking about it.\nYears ago, an artist I worked with recommended an art instruction book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had always wanted to learn how to draw, and this book promised to teach even the basics of understanding a pencil and how the brain interprets lines. One technique it taught was to place a square frame around any picture to simplify a complex scene. Standing there, I couldn't mentally project that frame onto the bowl of fruit in front of me. I was too overwhelmed, too awed by the prospect of painting. If I had any pretensions to being artistic, this was my first canvas, my first story: \"Work in Brown.\"\nFingertips resting on the brush handle, muscles tensing and relaxing as I moved my hand through space, I was about to capture a moment of creativity. Water circled, clear and calm, crystal clear and clean. Matter broke away and was swept away. My hand hit the handle again, muscles tightening more this time, a little more anxious. The brown package refused to budge. It was stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.\nMop in hand, feet spread apart, tie knotted tightly around my throat, I frowned at the offensive bundle of food waste left for the bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more quiet moments, then my hand reached for the wall, the end of the toilet paper. I wrapped it around my hand until it looked like an oven mitt. Standing up straight, I bent down, my hand slowly entering the bowl, like a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Another tragic trend that's been making headlines lately is the alarming number of teenagers dying behind the wheel. Several factors are at play here, and it's a deadly combination. The National Institutes of Health point out that the teen brain isn't fully mature for driving yet, and this immaturity, combined with sheer inexperience, leads to more fatal crashes, vehicle rollovers, speeding tickets, and off-road incidents. Add to that the fact that teens often drive with friends, which is something anyone with a speck of wisdom knows they do frequently. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found that the number of traffic accidents increases with the age of the passengers in the car.\n\nTo tackle this issue, some states have introduced temporary provisional licenses that restrict teens to drive only during certain hours and ban other minors as passengers. However, these measures are just temporary fixes. The real problem is that, as a group, young drivers just aren't ready to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes that even 18 is too young for a full driver's license. He's found that teens under 19 or 20 often crave excitement and take risks for the thrill of it, and it makes sense to delay driving until these tendencies mellow out. If we keep issuing driver's licenses to young teens, we're looking at more deadly crashes and a potential surge in teen deaths in just a few years. By 2010, the Baby Boomers' children will be eligible to drive, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads.\n\nAddressing this issue through legislation could be relatively simple. Schools could start teaching future drivers, but no one under 18 could actually drive a car. Provisional permits could still be issued, and teens would need to complete a certain number of hours of driving practice with an adult, similar to the requirements in most states. The specific number could be based on the current standards (6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult in California, for example). As the statistics show, teen driving fatalities are a concern across all states, making a uniform national policy a reasonable and effective solution.\n\nThis proposed legislation isn't a groundbreaking idea, but it could make a significant difference in the safety of our young drivers.",
            "So I decided to take a gander at the Library of Congress's collection of Edison's old films, specifically the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films were basically all about creative editing to create illusions. My film study focused on describing the poetic elements of most trick films and examining the unique characteristics of a few of the later ones. The trick films of the time were pretty much confined to a set, framed within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, long and medium shots, and sticking to the one shot, one film rule.\n\nBut some of these films at the beginning of the twentieth century were bold enough to break these rules by introducing aspects like multiple shots. One thing that stood out in these trick films was their filming style. They were shot in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera didn't move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects, drawing from the theatre and vaudeville tradition. Figures in trick films generally only moved side-to-side, not towards or away from the camera. For instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right and moved back and forth along the horizontal axis, without the camera following them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium setup also meant that shots were typically long shots or, less often, medium shots. Close-ups were never used in any of the Edison trick films. This again was borrowed from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. Since actors didn't move towards the camera, close-ups were non-existent.\n\nMost of these early trick films followed the pattern of one conceptual shot equaling a film. This usually kept the films short, about a minute or less, and limited their dramatic or narrative use. They mainly focused on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing, and switching acts, with little story. However, what appeared to be one conceptual shot to the viewer actually wasn't necessarily one physical shot. A single \"shot\" could be made up of several joined together to create illusions like apparition or disappearing. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) as an example. A closer look reveals that the physical shot with Mary's \"head\" starts, even though the film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate supporter of the Republican cause. Despite being primarily a farmer, his time in politics and his commitment to his profession instilled in him a deep dedication to personal liberty and the principles of government. His devotion to an agrarian lifestyle shaped nearly all of his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique opportunity to establish a perfect system because no native traditions hindered its founding, allowing for a government of self-governance. He held firm beliefs in the interdependence of natural rights and the need for them to be beyond government control. He argued that those with physical strength and cunning took advantage in a state of nature, but in civilization, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must account for human nature’s inherent good and evil. He was rigid in his dualistic morality, stating, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He considered principles that protected private property, improved agriculture, and discouraged capitalism as good, and believed a government founded on these principles would function fairly despite its corruptible administration.\n\nTaylor, like many of his contemporaries, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a minimal Federal government, only granting it powers explicitly stated in the Constitution. He acknowledged that an expansive Federal government could become tyrannical due to its cost, but he also cautioned that a simple, literal interpretation could lead to corruption without considering the founders' intent. The Declaration of Independence, he believed, was the true charter of the United States, as it explicitly described the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, we noticed a significant drop in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project. This was quite disheartening, and it's tough to pinpoint the exact cause. With winter setting in at the New England campus, commuting by bicycle or on foot naturally declined. December also marks the end of the fall semester, a time when everyone is busy with schoolwork and grading. Filling out the commuter log might have gotten lost in the shuffle. Plus, December brings the holiday season, often resulting in a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, which might have contributed to the low log submissions for that month. However, February's low submissions remain unexplained. The project might just have experienced an initial burst of energy that naturally faded. To boost engagement, we organized the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which did indeed increase log submissions. This highlights the challenge of maintaining project momentum during natural engagement dips and holiday/semester breaks. Another hurdle for this project, or any similar initiative, is the deeply ingrained culture of driving personal cars for commuting. To encourage alternative commuting, we offered gift certificates to local businesses like restaurants, coffee shops, a bookstore, and even national chains. It would have been interesting to see the impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars. If we had gradually increased the prize value over time, it might have boosted participation and engagement. The gift cards were effective at the start, but announcing larger prizes in December and January could have sustained and possibly even increased participation.",
            "Another financial tool to consider is an ETF, or exchange-traded fund. Unlike index funds, ETFs offer more flexibility and trade like individual stocks on an exchange. They bring the diversification of an index fund and the perks of owning a single stock, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share. The advantages are clear, but so are some drawbacks. Like stocks, ETFs charge commissions on trades, and while their expense ratios are lower than mutual funds, they can still add up.\n\nA savvy investor should assess whether the benefits of owning an ETF, like diversification, truly exist and to what extent. For this effort, let's examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. The top 10 holdings are listed below along with their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge how well these top 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, let's calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, normalized to 100%. The results of these calculations are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase. Additionally, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. Initially, it seems a portfolio of the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower Beta. However, the statistical significance of these portfolios may not be different.\n\nTo determine if the portfolios are statistically different, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Another one of Edgar Allan Poe's notable works is \"Dream-Land,\" which he himself considered one of his better poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which, according to Mabbott, traces back to Virgil's writings. Virgil used this term to refer to an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world by the Greeks. While it is certain that Virgil did use the term, there is a more contemporary source to which credit may also be given. Poe had a keen interest in German authors, especially the works of Goethe.\n\nThis is significant because it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" discusses the similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe was likely influenced by Goethe's work.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a celebrated writer, particularly known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second in the year of his death, 1832. Within the second part of Faust, there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells the story of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet as a gift. After her death, the king becomes consumed with drinking and grief, ultimately deciding to end his life. He gives away all his possessions to his children, except for the goblet, which he throws into the sea before deleting himself from the cliff. The descriptions of the King of Thule and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, suggesting a dark reflection of Poe's own experiences and struggles with substance abuse.\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his collected works. He uses the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but he also employs the term \"Thule\" as bookends for \"Dream-Land.\" \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule, which is dark, lonely, and haunted by the memory of dead friends. The lack of color in the world mirrors the gloom of the King of Thule's situation after the loss of his wife. The entire poem is as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a significant author whose work Poe would have known, if for no other reason than his admiration for Tennyson. When asked if he admired Tennyson, Poe expressed that, aside from their connection, he would have been exposed to Goethe's work through numerous reproductions of his original publications.",
            "In the case of Jennifer Palmer suing D&D Markets, California law may allow her to seek punitive damages if she can prove the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with malicious intent. Palmer needs to show that Martin was aware of the potential harm from the applesauce spill and deliberately disregarded it. Martin was informed about the spill twice, but he failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner. This could be considered malicious if he knew the previous incidents involving slip-and-fall injuries and chose not to act. Palmer's claim that Martin's actions were despicable is weaker but still reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009.",
            "CBC was the place where I first delved into the teachings of Islam, four years ago now. The heated debates sparked in class about whether or not Islam is inherently hostile were as relevant then as they are today, perhaps even more so. Since 9/11, I've witnessed the media's view of Islam shifting from outright hostility towards extremists to an almost extreme tolerance. I doubt that, back in 2001, an American presidential candidate with an obvious Muslim background like Barack Obama could have been a possibility.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography has always intrigued me, as it seems to present a stark contrast to the historical accounts I've read. According to the biography, Muhammad is portrayed as a martyr and a humble figure who, rather than forcibly converting others, saw people come to him seeking the truth in his teachings. This depiction, however, doesn't align with the historical narrative of Muhammad's rise to power. It's as if the biography is trying to elevate Muhammad to a godly figure, portraying him as wise, gentle, and humble. Yet, history contradicts this, and I can't help but wonder if modern Muslims are aware of the true historical context surrounding Muhammad's rise.\n\nMoreover, there are uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad that intrigue me. For instance, the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men bears a striking resemblance to Jesus' miracle of feeding the five thousand. This style of writing, I believe, is an attempt to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who, through his actions and teachings, demonstrates the truth without needing to prove anything. This approach, however, diminishes the life and miracles of Jesus, making it seem like they are borrowing credit from his life.\n\nThe biography also includes numerous stories that aim to provide 'witnesses' to the conversion of people to Islam. However, many of these tales are told from a third-party perspective, such as the author hearing the story from someone who heard it from another person. I found this approach to be less convincing, as it often diminishes the stories' credibility by adding layers of uncertainty. It's as if the authors were trying to build a case for the truth of the stories, but the third-party nature of many of them makes it seem more like a string of hearsay.\n\nWhat troubles me the most about this work is the attempt to portray Muhammad as a godly, humble, and wise figure. This portrayal contradicts historical accounts of Muhammad's rise to power and makes me question whether modern Muslims are aware of the historical context surrounding his life.",
            "So, the teachings of Jesus, the beliefs he held during his lifetime, were quickly left behind as Christianity evolved after his passing. Looking at this from a broad perspective, it's clear that Christianity has drifted further and further from its origins over time. Today, we see a growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive trend. While traditional people persist and may resist any new thinking, they might not be enough to influence the entire population. Among believers, a historical awareness will undoubtedly grow in future years. There will be a longing to distinguish the doctrines added to Christianity over time from what Jesus originally intended. It may take decades or even centuries, but the end result will be inevitable: a return to the religion's original form. A movement will emerge, growing in numbers, and will peel away layers of doctrine, one by one, like a clock winding backward. When this trend reaches the United States and Europe, it will influence many to worship as if they were living during Jesus' time, following only his ideas. The church, as an institution, will remain strong to guide this path. However, as the theological clock reverses, the extreme diversity within Christendom will reduce to greater uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions, we'll see increasing similarities instead of differences. Human history is filled with such reversals. For example, Christians were once persecuted and killed by the Roman Empire, but the empire later became a Christian institution. Our country has transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversal coming in the future will play out in the realm of Christianity, undoing history and diversity in the process. A key part of what will enable this process is interpreting Jesus' words as metaphorical, rather than literal statements. So, what has happened since Jesus' lifetime?\n       If we delve deep into history, we find that Judaism was the theological foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, the belief in a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were at the core of the religion by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not unified in spirit, dividing into groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots, along with a majority of common people.",
            "I believe that \"The Jungle\" illustrates how, deep down, humans are inherently selfish and focused solely on their own prosperity. They strive to make their lives as comfortable and successful as possible, without considering the well-being of those less fortunate. This is evident in the owners and managers of the massive factories, who are solely driven by the desire to expand their enterprises, often at the expense of others. They disregard any collateral damage caused by their relentless pursuit of growth. Upton Sinclair vividly portrays this with his description, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery highlights the environmental devastation and the callous disregard for all life forms affected by the factories. The owners and managers also prioritize profits over their employees' welfare, subjecting them to grueling work conditions without any concern for their well-being or safety. They exploit their workers, often firing them without notice or compensation, as there were few regulations or protections for labor in that era. Sinclair's portrayal of the workers as \"slaves\" underscores the inhuman treatment they endured, with no recourse or support systems in place. Even when unions were formed, they often worsened the situation by exploiting the workers themselves. The unchecked power of the owners and managers, combined with the desperation of the workers, resulted in a system that was as oppressive and exploitative as chattel slavery.",
            "Many authors employ various methods to evoke specific feelings or attitudes towards significant topics. Some techniques work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes many of these methods in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" One approach he often uses is combining an adjective and a noun that don't typically go together to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. Another technique is investing meaning in symbols and using them repeatedly for the same purpose. Fitzgerald employs the latter technique with several colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel, Fitzgerald assigns meanings to colors like white/gray and red/pink, and later uses these meanings to reinforce a particular feeling around important objects.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald assigns to white/gray is uniformity, with white representing a higher, more refined status, and gray signifying age and decay. He establishes this meaning early in the novel by frequently using both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as “in white” (8), and even Nick wears “white flannels” (41) at Gatsby’s party. Tom is in a “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). The only time people aren’t wearing white is when Nick observes Gatsby’s party: “the halls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald also uses these colors to depict common, unimportant subjects: as Nick heads to work, he descends “the white chasms of lower New York” (56), and the names of people at Gatsby’s parties become “gray names” (61) on his schedule. Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses” (28), and plain or common people and places are described as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a “white girlhood” (19), there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\n\nAfter imbuing these colors with meaning, Fitzgerald uses them to symbolize unimportance or uniformity in subjects. This technique begins with Daisy. After a long period with little significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster” (74); readers start to perceive Daisy as less of a character and more like a uniform, something that Gatsby desires and yearns for. Fitzgerald employs this method often to emphasize Daisy’s uniformity, such as with a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18) and her wearing “white” (115) before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",
            "Another thing I've been doing is researching the land around San Diego. It's got a great climate for farming, so it's no surprise that it's super productive. You can find all sorts of stuff there like tomatoes, citrus fruits, and all sorts of greens. There's a big market for organic produce too, with many local supporters lined up. Plus, they do tours and let you enjoy the outdoors. Sounds like a sweet deal, right? But it's not all sunshine and roses. Organic farming can be pricey because you've got to put in extra work to keep things pest-free and healthy without using chemicals. And the land I found on a real estate website? It's a big piece of chaparral, grassland, and oak forest next to a national forest. It's home to some rare critters, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. There's a conservation plan for the area that's still being worked on, but it's got over a hundred species on the list. The land has a history too - it was used by Native Americans and later by cattle ranchers. I'm looking into government programs to see if I can get some help to make the farm more profitable and wildlife-friendly.",
            "Culture plays a significant part in any negotiation. Culture is more about what it isn't than what it is, and its significance can vary greatly. It's not one-size-fits-all, and generalizations like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are too broad and oversimplified. While understanding general cultural traits is helpful, it's more important to grasp how a culture's attitudes and values impact negotiations and how to adapt to them. When encountering a foreign culture, one tends to relate it to their own, making comparisons inevitable. Understanding a foreign culture or mindset can involve delving into its history and recognizing its prejudices. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, one should simply accept it and work within its parameters, especially if you're at a weaker bargaining position. If you're in a \"foreign\" environment, respecting local traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt's also crucial to note that culture isn't just about national or international differences. Within a single nation, many companies have their own corporate cultures. These can vary widely, with some emphasizing long hours, while others foster a more relaxed work schedule. You can see these differences in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some companies encourage employee philanthropy at any level, while others limit it to \"company-approved\" causes. Even within the U.S., corporate cultures can vary greatly, from region to region and from urban to suburban environments. Some cultures may appear more uniform to outsiders, but it's essential to look deeper.\n\nValues are particularly important to understand because they explain why a culture is the way it is. If saving face or communal harmony is valued in a culture, a negotiator won't publicly shame their company or superiors to succeed. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes a hard-driven bargain won't rush to settle. It's crucial to consider these generalizations before sitting down at the table, but also to learn something about your opponent's personal background to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, \"There is no God.\" This quote, found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, is the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about the existence of God. Interestingly, this sentiment is shared by another author we'll discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Both of their arguments aim to prove the existence of the same concept of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To simplify, we must assume they both believe in this God. However, neither truly provides a complete basis for belief in God.\n\nLet's first look at St. Anselm's argument. He suggests that understanding God comes from within our own hearts. He argues that since God exists within our understanding, we cannot conceive of his non-existence. This concept, although worded convolutedly, basically means that proof for God lies within our own minds. We don't need to search beyond our inner selves for evidence; the truth about God is found by exploring what we inherently know. This idea is often called faith within Christian literature.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas believes that God's existence can be proven through logic and empirical evidence, without relying on faith. Such a stance is advantageous for converting new believers, as it allows for recruitment without needing people to accept unprovable concepts. Aquinas presents five logical arguments to support this claim: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He shows that the proof of God's existence lies in the logical necessity for him. If you know you're missing a puzzle piece, you can deduce the features and existence of the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Sometime around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned the world and attained enlightenment, leading to the birth of Buddhism—with the most traditional sect being Theravada Buddhism. The religion is nearly twenty-five hundred years old, and it has evolved significantly from its original form. This can be seen in Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Monks and laypeople alike take part, despite Buddha never having taught about such a ritual. These changes range from superficial traditions to the religion's core beliefs. Both monastic and lay Theravada Buddhists have had to adjust their doctrinal principles over time, due to both internal and external influences, both friendly and hostile.\n\nThis discussion will use several key terms. Internal forces are those that originate from within the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. External forces are those from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, born of a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces are those that don't intend to harm or help, but may do so as a side effect. These terms will be used frequently in this discussion.\n\nTo understand the religion, we must first explore its core doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is made up of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka includes all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka sets out rules for life, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka deals with the religion's metaphysical components. These include concepts like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering, and Anicca—impermanence. Only by accepting these ideas can one escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and overcome lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka contains rules for life, such as the five precepts for laypeople and many more for monks. The most fundamental principle of Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico once shared a long-standing rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145) describe this rivalry, with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 being its peak. During this conflict, the United States attacked and won, gaining Texas and the American Southwest. The rivalry was fueled by differences in religion, culture, and tradition, as well as a clash of material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). This isn't uncommon among neighboring nations. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes, “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41). Mexico and Cuba, being geographically close to the United States, have historically been rivals, unlike other Latin American nations that have maintained good relations with the United States. Religious differences, similar to the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, played a significant role in this rivalry. Sally Frahm (2001) states, “If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy” (p. 86). The distrust between the English and Spanish, a legacy from colonial times, further strained relations. Diehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes during this 57-year period, most of which were territorial issues involving border raids and frontier problems. Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry's decline began when Mexico became more dependent on the United States, and it ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly struck down by an illness that I had never known existed.\n\nAt the time, I was a nurse. I had chosen this profession due to a deep-seated need for the safety and security that I had lacked as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" was the mantra I heard repeatedly as I grew older. Thus, even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist, perhaps a mix of both, I chose nursing.\n\nNow, here I am, 46 years old, single, and without much money in the bank, unable to work. I am still disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I have virtually nothing left that I can call my own. I manage to get by, but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, yet, there is one thing I know for certain. I could not have made it through all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. And let me tell you, when real disaster strikes, you do not feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life, big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well one prepares, some things are just too big to overcome on your own.\n\nI concur wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's \"basket\"; Lord knows it is moldy and falling apart, anyway. Yet, I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again—learning to help each other and to ask for help, rather than having each of us individually scrambling out to the backyard to build fallout shelters.\n\nThe Conservatives in the U.S. talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism; it was compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and an array of batteries, candles, and waterproof matches, as well as canned goods. If you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food—do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you are at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Alright, so, why do organisms evolve the way they do? Are there certain rules or limits that guide the path of evolutionary change? Well, back in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson said that even then, scientists were barely scratching the surface of defining organic forms mathematically. Fast forward to today, and we're using math to understand mollusks' skeleton growth over time through both individual development and across generations. Our research is all about blending mathematical modeling with experiments to figure out how growth and size changes happen. We used X-ray images of Prunum species to spot key measurements and entered them into a software called CerioShell. By creating hypothetical shell shapes, we're exploring the limits of possible changes in Prunum. And we're combining this with experiments and descriptions to better grasp the big picture of evolution in this group.\n\nImagine a shell as a tube that wraps around a central axis called the columella, spinning in 360-degree loops called whorls. The speed at which these whorls grow varies, and a continuous line separates each one, known as a suture. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, called the body whorl, and the rest are part of the spire. The shell's tip is called the apex, and the other end is the base. The animal exits through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be seen from different angles: apical, basal, apertural, or abapertural. The most common way to view a shell is apertural, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, start by looking at the shell from the apical view, find the first suture, and draw a line through it. Count whorls from there, estimating to a quarter of a whorl as needed.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. You can trace this path using the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture. This trajectory can be shown both graphically and mathematically. Once you have a mathematical formula, you can tweak parameters to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "So, another decade has rolled by, and it seems life in Indonesia, at least when it comes to neonatal and infant mortality, has been rather stagnant. The nation's progress in meeting the Millennium Development Goals is noteworthy, with marked improvements in water and sanitation. However, the pace of progress in reducing child and maternal health issues is far from where it needs to be by 2015. Let's delve into the reasons behind these shortcomings and why we should focus on strengthening the overall health system rather than just tweaking specific programs.\n\nA positive sign is that 72% of births now see a skilled health worker, but this includes traditional workers like midwives who can't handle complications. This improvement is misleading, as there's still much work to be done. Additionally, the treatment of diarrheal cases in children under five has decreased, and postnatal care is an area of concern with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarian-section rates are still dismally low at 4%, with urban areas at 7% and rural areas at just 2%, indicating a severe equity gap in healthcare access. This disparity is further exacerbated by a 27% gap in service utilization between the richest and poorest quintiles, suggesting that the poor struggle to access healthcare services likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care, the most crucial question is how to best address the lack of service. Should Indonesia focus on program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system? Programmatic approaches are appealing due to their targeted, manageable nature and faster results. However, investing heavily in one area may starve other sectors of funding and resources, leading to a duplication of uncoordinated services and an increase in administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels diverge from the norm by incorporating elements of mystery and the bizarre, which serve to enrich the characters and provide deeper insights into their motivations and emotions. Both works employ dream sequences or dreamlike states to convey this sense of mystery, though the specifics vary in each case.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often unveil Oliver's inner turmoil, revealing what troubles him and his awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event vividly, as if in a dream, while struggling to find help. This passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events and his dire physical condition, as reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself leaves Oliver overwhelmed, his senses numbed as he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" that bears him away; he experiences his despair anew, removed from the initial shock of pain, as the pain becomes constant and linked with fear rather than surprise. The question arises as to whose will brought about his misfortune, as it certainly wasn't his own. This shooting underscores Oliver's limited control over his circumstances, even as his life is in danger. Furthermore, it suggests a growing sense of defeat, as if Fagin has begun to break him, compelling him to accept this despair and influencing his ability to react. It can be assumed that if Oliver were not resigned to this despair, he would have made at least a minimal effort to save himself.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "Back in the day, I worked as a tutor for an after-school program, helping elementary kids with their homework. While I excelled in English and reading, I was recruited to assist a kid named Adrian, who was having a rough time with reading. Initially, it seemed like he had peculiar reading problems, but it turned out his issue was that he could read, but he didn't know the English alphabet well. I finally realized this when his mom walked in, speaking only Spanish. With my fledgling Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. That day, I understood Adrian's struggle, and I hope he's doing better now. I share this story to highlight the language barrier in schools, particularly in California. It's not always as evident as we think, and even kids who speak perfect English can struggle with reading due to alphabet and pronunciation issues. The solution isn't simple; it requires a combination of approaches, like dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes. For Adrian, tutoring in English reading and pronunciation was effective, but for kids who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. The key is combining all these methods to address the language barrier effectively.",
            "From childhood, many of us are taught that something larger than ourselves exists, something we can't comprehend. Some of us learn about it through Sunday school or religious institutions, while others look within themselves or reject it altogether, embracing our own egocentric universe. Each of us defines our spirituality through our unique perspectives, searching for light in the darkness to guide us. When my father passed away, he was, in many ways, already gone. I chose not to witness his departure, preferring to remember him through his life rather than his death. I couldn't let the knowledge of his passing make it more real for both of us, so I curled up in a ball in my bed, waiting for the news. No one called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel,\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, is essentially an \"old-new\" oxymoron. The Gothic mode has been both criticized and celebrated, accused of lacking depth, and praised for its 'terrible sublime' quality (Burke). The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, merged ideas from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new literary approach. Walpole combined old theatrical elements and modern mimicry of nature in his 'modern' novels, presenting what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often incorporates throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to modern societal and literary advancements. The blend of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" style and the new novel format, which allowed readers a more personal view of character psychology, kept Gothic relevant for a long time, making it both obsolete and new to readers far removed from the original time.\n\nOne of the key themes in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, or the training of a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it represents the classic knight—brave, honorable, competent—and the perceived lack of that ideal in their contemporary society. Through chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the genre's evolution towards Romanticism, and used to try and improve the present. Walpole, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, was living in a politically tumultuous era and grappling with the possibility of a troubled future. Immersed in politics and unfair accusations, he may have begun to believe, if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" of people in the Gothic era had been lost in the individuals making up the 'present' society. This sentiment is evident in several characters, one being Frederic. The reader learns about Frederic before meeting him, and he embodies many chivalric traits: he is a prince, has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently thought to be killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, bringing into play the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the chain of events that moves goods from an initial customer order through to the stage of raw materials, production, distribution, and final delivery to the customer. The term \"supply chain management\" was coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant, who described it as the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what happens in the supply chain to meet customers' needs efficiently. This process revolves around six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to ensure optimal customer service.\n\nThe first crucial step in the supply chain is production. Production is foundational to the entire process. Managers must understand what customers want, which can be gauged by studying the market. The market's demands influence what products should be produced and in what quantities. Once the market study is complete, managers determine where and which plant would be best for production, considering volume and quality requirements. The next step is scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Each detail in production is vital, and any oversight can result in significant time and money losses. For instance, I previously worked at Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business had a designated process, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks. These outlined processes ensure smooth operations and clarity in expectations.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply, which involves strategic decisions to shape the core capabilities of a facility and form partnerships for outsourcing. A company may have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with unique equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division best fits the product's processes. Outsourcing can also be a strategy to create velocity, which is the ability to offer high-quality and flexible services while minimizing costs.",
            "The sign reads: \"Hitler lives on in Burma.\" Ellen Page, the actor from the movie Juno, stands alone on a city street with a cardboard sign held high, the chilling message written in Sharpie. Burma, or Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a brutal military junta that seized control in 1962 following a coup d'état. In 2007, a series of public protests known as \"The Saffron Revolution\" erupted, sparked by monks. Initially, the government tolerated these peaceful gatherings, but the violence soon escalated as the military attacked monasteries nation-wide. Foreign journalists were arrested, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed during a protest on September 27th, 2007. The official death toll stands at 13, but a defected colonel claims many more were killed, numbering potentially in the thousands.\n\nThis isn't a new trend. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. Early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were considered gods, and even our current president, George W. Bush, allegedly holds weekly meetings with Ted Haggard of Stupid People Worldwide, a branch of the Republican Party.\n\nNotable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protest, where intellectuals, workers, and students gathered to challenge the government's authoritarian rule, with death tolls ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s involved Hutu militias and the government systematically killing Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler's \"Third Reich\" was a period of systematic persecution and murder of individuals of Jewish background across multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz is greatly due to his longevity and the creative prowess he brought to his orchestra. Often seen as a subtle pianist in many of his compositions, Ellington excelled in composing rich and complex pieces that highlighted each band member's unique abilities. He established a framework where soloists could freely improvise, writing tightly orchestrated sections that showcased each player's style. This not only emphasized the tone of the orchestra but also created a unique and coherent sound for every piece. Ellington's mastery of individual players' sounds, as well as how they blended together into a cohesive ensemble, resulted in some of jazz's most innovative and brilliant works. The Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's use of voice as a jazz instrument, exemplified in Creole Love Call, where he utilized the voice to add texture and color without lyrics. This piece is notable for its six choruses, each featuring different instrumental sections and soloists, demonstrating Ellington's ability to complement his soloists' styles. In Hot and Bothered and It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington continued to excel at tight orchestration and tone color, using unique combinations of vocal and instrumental elements to create rich, complementary sounds.",
            "She had always felt this gnawing emptiness, a longing that couldn't be satisfied. It began when she was 14, just starting to navigate teenage life, and it persisted at 17. She had come to realize she desired a certain someone rather than some material possession, but no boy had caught her interest. Several had tried to woo her, with varying degrees of clumsiness, but none sparked the spark she craved. She often pondered this peculiar situation, wondering what could be the cause. Years of introspection offered theories, but nothing concrete enough to give her any clarity. So, she continued living her life, perpetually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually serene and peaceful. Her parents were calm and harmonious, rarely arguing with each other or her. The only disputes were over her asserting her independence and unique personality. They were fond of her for her lively spirit, which complemented their laid-back nature, making her well-liked and nice.\n\nToday, however, was not a typical peaceful day. As she moved from room to room, searching for inspiration, a sudden shriek from the kitchen pierced the air. She rushed in to find her mother lying on the floor, in obvious pain. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she cried out in panic. Her mother managed to whisper, \"Ouch...sweetie...I...need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her daughter quickly sprang into action, helped her mother into the car, and drove them to the nearest hospital.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the familiar scent of disinfectant and the underlying aroma of sickness. She wasn't focused on that, though; her mind was consumed with worrying about her mother. She rushed her mother to the nearest doctor, who immediately set to work.

The doctor's assessment was clear: her mother needed critical care.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed), is linked to reduced chances of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is a tweaked version of the Med diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, while also lowering intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is allowed.\n\nPrevious research found an inverse relationship between following the Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular mortality (CVD), and showed that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in overweight individuals. However, these studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Every six years from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). More than 95% of nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year period. FFQs were validated, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Cases without available records were considered \"probable\" and included, with around 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts classified this way. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, with leisure-time physical activity assessed starting in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated. Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could confuse results) by considering age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the association between the aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, there were 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "Well, you know what happened in '07, it was a complete financial meltdown. Jobless rates soared, the housing market tanked, and many big shots in business were left in the dust. We've been feeling the effects ever since. I reckon we should ask ourselves, how did it all go south, and how can we avoid it happening again? Now, the crisis was cooked up by politicians who were pushing banks to give out sub-prime loans, even though the financial system wasn't ready. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were also under pressure to back these mortgages and then resell them as CDOs and CDSs. When people started defaulting on these loans, the banks were left high and dry, and it all cascaded into a full-blown economic disaster.\n\nThe seeds of this mess were sown back in '99 during the Clinton era. The President was eyeing a second term, and he wanted to boost his popularity. So, he relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime fiasco just seven years later. Steven Holmes, writing for the New York Times, warned back then, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest mortgage underwriter, was facing increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgages for low and moderate-income people and from stockholders to keep growing profits.” Holmes was right on the mark: ill-advised lending would indeed bring about the economic meltdown.\n\nA lot of things combined to send the economy into a spin. Mortgages were getting more complicated, with adjustable rates, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs becoming common. This only made the housing market more interconnected with the rest of the economy, leaving people and financial markets vulnerable to any little price changes.\n\nAnd then, the housing bubble burst. Banks that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left with nothing but sour faces. The top five U.S. investment banks reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007—that's about 30% of the USA's GDP. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch got sold off cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks, all under intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were in $5 trillion worth of mortgage debt and were put under government control in September 2008. It was a mess, and it all started with some bad political decisions.",
            "So here we are, exposition time. That's the part where you spread your writer's wings and either captivate or bore your readers. Dr. Merlin, she's known to shout at her monitor when caught in the throes of Too Much Information, and not in the fun kind of way either.\n\nWe all know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still finds herself in the muck of long-winded text where nothing much happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is that little devil on your shoulder telling you to get the history out of the way to get to the good stuff, not to be confused with the devil on the other shoulder who wants you to dump every detail of your characters' pasts onto your audience.\n\nExposition means just telling the audience what happened, typically in straightforward prose. In movies, it's when one character pours out a bunch of info to another, like the Ancient Mariner. In fiction, the author does the pouring.\n\nConsider this: you're reading along and are told the heroine met her love at such a place and time, they were married in a grand fashion, and he was murdered in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to stretch over two pages, with only a handful of lines of dialogue. You'd expect a bit more than just the bare facts—some insight into how he loved her, how she changed because of him. You'd mourn his death with her, and thus, become more connected to her character.\n\nIn short, you'd expect some meat on the simple bone of the story: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.

Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he was once in the Air Force, now runs a gas station at night, has been married twice, no kids, loves fishing on weekends, and dreams of owning the station someday, just had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nBut you gotta slow down and provide those details.

            "I caught two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, today (August 13, 2011). The first was a \"live\" segment on NBC 4. The lead story was about a guy named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who stabbed his wife – they didn't mention her name. His mug shot was shown, and he had an eerie look about him. They only spent about two minutes on this story, which seemed appropriate given it was still developing.\n\nThe second story was about the shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and there were no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was investigating. This story felt short, and I suspect that might be due to the fact that it involved a \"black\" man or a black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that minorities are often overlooked when they're victims of crimes. If it were a \"white\" child or adult, the media would go crazy, but for a minority, it's lucky if it's even mentioned.\n\nNext up, they discussed a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where the incident might have occurred, and it was determined to be a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a five-thousand-dollar reward for tips leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThen, they talked about rain and thunderstorms expected for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned the temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The story was a bit short, but it was used as a teaser to keep us tuned in.\n\nThey also ran a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man in a hoodie sweatshirt, about six feet tall and 150 pounds. They devoted an unusual amount of time talking about his race and how dark he was, which felt excessive.\n\nFinally, they mentioned a convicted drug kingpin named Rene Rodriguez. He was a Hispanic man from Texas, convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio. Instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years in prison, they said \"300\" months. I'm not sure why they did that, perhaps to make it sound harsher. They also mentioned his Hispanic background, which I don't think was really relevant to the story.",
            "There is an unbreakable bond between brothers, a connection that is as complex as it is profound. This bond carries with it a range of emotions - love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers, more than anyone else, understand each other deeply. They can see themselves reflected in their brother's eyes, seeing not how others perceive them, but their true selves. It's in moments of crisis that this bond truly shines, revealing the good and the bad. When these feelings surface, they come with a hefty price tag. Understanding these emotions, and their consequences, is part of appreciating the weight of this fraternal connection. When a brother looks at you, they see not just you, but your essence. Their actions and the outcomes of those actions unveil their true character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the journey of two brothers. Through their interactions and the narrator's perspective, the intense emotions that accompany this bond are vividly depicted. The protagonist's feelings are dominated by one emotion: pride. From their first adventure together to their final, tragic outing, the protagonist feels resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He dreams of teaching Doodle all the skills he knows, like holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing Old Woman Swamp vines. He wants a brother to race with to Horsehead Landing and to perch with in the great pine tree. These dreams are shattered when Doodle's weak heart condition is revealed. The protagonist is filled with anger, even considering suffocating Doodle with a pillow. Yet, his heart softens when Doodle smiles at him. This moment of weakness in his conviction shows the love he has, albeit hidden, for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex, innovative information processor. As technology evolved from primitive to contemporary times, so did the analogies used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and most recently, a computer. As you delve into the brain, remember that these metaphors are limited in their usefulness and can lead to misconceptions. Information processing begins with input from the senses, converting physical sensations such as touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. The sensory data is continually transformed by the brain's algorithms, both through bottom-up and top-down processes. For instance, when you see a black box against a white background, bottom-up processing helps determine the object's simple properties like color, orientation, and edges. Top-down processing speeds up recognition by using decisions made from previous steps. This could help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the background. Once data is processed, an attention filter decides its importance and which cognitive processes should access it. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. However, you might pick out your name in a noisy room. Numerous processing stages exist, with results modulated by attention repeatedly. To process information, the brain must first store it. Various memory types include sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information is encoded uniquely for each sensory stimulus type, such as structurally for printed words, phonemically for sounds, or semantically for meanings. Once stored, information must be maintained, and studies suggest working memory uses electrical signals looping through neurons for a short period. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in specific protein structures. Several models describe how knowledge is organized in the brain, including those based on human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as nodes linked by their relatedness. For example, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes a critical stance against the impending threat of both technology and the capitalist system that supports it, as depicted in his dystopian novel Brave New World. The people in this society prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to pursue immediate gratification. The citizens are essentially pawns in a grand game, controlled by the World Controller who dictates their ideology. Analyzing the novel through the lens of Marxist criticism, we find that Huxley's reservations about the development of these systems are evident. Terms like homogenization and reification reinforce the idea that the novel is a commentary on the flaws in the emerging economy during Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the concept of false consciousness, a Marxist thesis. Essentially, common citizens are prevented from understanding their true economic relations to other classes, as they are primarily focused on their own interests. This is a result of ideological control over the proletariat and the laboring classes, evident in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The various social classes, such as Delta and Gamma, lack any real will of their own, as their drive to consume and indulge is strengthened through hypnopædia. This manipulation is carried out by the World Controller. Hegemony, the idea that one social class is dominated by another, is clearly present here. The lower classes are completely unaware of this manipulation, essentially 'buying into an ideology that supports the structure' (i.e., capitalism and consumerism). Even the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, typically accept their place, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions between the social classes also indicate the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are shallow and lack depth. Characters, even the major ones, are not well-defined, suggesting that technology and capitalism together may deprive people of their free will and expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, with interactions kept superficial. Males often comment on women's physical attributes, while females discuss their encounters. This superficiality indicates the socioeconomic effect of capitalism. The absolute obedience of each societal class to their role in the community reflects Marxist thoughts on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority so long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for nearly two and a half years, which is four and a half semesters. Getting around campus can be a real challenge. During my freshman year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm, the farthest from the center of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in places like Willard building, which is near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially on days when the weather was bad. I talked to an older alum who told me that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by vast empty fields. Now, those spaces are filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and the new health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to grow, navigating from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. What's the best solution to this mobility problem? The answer is bicycles. But having a bike doesn't solve all problems. Students need to ride them regularly, and the campus needs to be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nJust the other day, I was chatting with a friend who recently started cycling again after taking a break. He said, \"Bikes are fantastic! For a few years, they weren't the coolest thing to ride, but they're the only way to commute around.\" Cycling is not only good for your body but also the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus, just as far from the center as some dorms are. The best decision I made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have a class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding my bike can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. However, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas from my house, and it's not always an easy road to navigate, whether by bike or on foot. There are certainly benefits to walking, but I barely have time for that. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day. That's more than two and a half hours each week. Add to that the time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on. That's more time than I can spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In my quest to become a social worker, I aim to focus on the Division of Family and Children Services. My goal is to support children who have been abused or neglected and offer assistance to troubled families. The values I bring to this field are service, respect, an ethical nature, and a commitment to improving relationships and my own professional competence. These values are not just beneficial to the social work field; they are integral to my personal being.\n\nI've always had a strong desire to help others, but I was uncertain about the career path I wanted to take. Throughout high school and college, I observed many individuals dodging their problems and employing subpar coping mechanisms. Witnessing these situations led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Even after graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I was still uncertain about my career. During a summer break, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. He was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I found out he had called the police to his parents' residence. I drove over to help and privately explained my concerns to the police. They requested that I speak with the parents, as there was nothing the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and blamed their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outsiders. This experience made me consider a career in social work to help children with \"simple\" family disputes.\n\nAnother crucial value for social work is social justice. While society claims to value each individual, the concept of “the individual” is often more aligned with traditional norms than actual uniqueness. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and refuse to limit myself to be like others. Throughout my schooling, I protested against social injustice: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, piercing my ears beyond the norm, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and fighting against racism and discrimination. I stand for social justice and will continue to protest against social injustice.",
            "So, this paper dives into the Biological and Sociocultural models concerning the disorder insomnia. The biological model zooms in on genetic info passed down, as well as the medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models, on the other hand, explore environmental relationships and their implications on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review examines insomnia through these models, breaking down each piece of research related to them and explaining it better. We’ll also critique the research findings and point out their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to another mental disorder, or sleep disorders due to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders linked to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other sleep disorders can stem from medical complications or substance use. Dyssomnias, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, each have their specific characteristics. Primary Insomnia, for instance, is a struggle with adequate or maintained sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is difficulty staying awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Meanwhile, Parasomnias, like Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder, are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder deal with sleep difficulties caused by Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). Our review focuses mainly on insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, inherited factors, and the physiological aspects of these disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, are crucial for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice found specific GABAB receptors on orexin neurons that regulate sleep and wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor, which is inhibited by baclofen, can increase sleep time. This suggests that animal models like mice can be generalized to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for GABAB receptors in humans. If these receptors are impaired, adequate sleep without medication could be affected. The sociocultural implication is that inherited phenotypes could naturally regulate sleep, and alterations in these receptors could disturb sleep, negatively impacting daily life, including school, career, and monotonous tasks.",
            "This article takes a look at three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, it provides a brief definition of the condition, describing it as a problem with the efficiency and effectiveness of how the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. In simpler terms, it’s a disorder where the brain struggles to properly process sounds we hear, even though the ears are functioning normally. People with CAPD can hear just fine, but the part of the brain responsible for separating words and filtering out background noise doesn't work as it should.\n\nThe origins of CAPD can be traced back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as “auditory imperception”. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for children with communication disorders in 1954. Kimura then introduced dichotic testing in 1961, which helped understand how the brain processes auditory information. A national conference in 1977 further sparked research on CAPD.\n\nThe disorder can manifest in various ways. A person with CAPD might have trouble pinpointing where sounds are coming from, distinguishing between different sounds, recognizing patterns, or detecting changes in speech. They may also struggle with sounds being blocked by subsequent ones, or have difficulty interpreting sounds to act upon them. Additionally, they might have trouble understanding the sequence of sounds presented to them.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a systematic observation of a patient’s listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. This can be done by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, or others using various measures. There’s no single, consistent tool for diagnosis, and the cause of CAPD is unknown. Tests often present multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask the patient to differentiate items like words or numbers. More advanced tests record acoustic signals in the ear and measure responses to them.\n\nLastly, the article concludes with ways a teacher in a mainstream classroom can assist a student with CAPD.",
            "So, Twelfth Night seems to suggest that while disguise can be handy for pulling off long deceits, at some point, you gotta drop it and return to your true self, or else you might lose yourself forever. The tricky part? When you reveal your true colors, you might find yourself all alone. Some folks won't mind being deceived, but others might take it hard. Like, really hard. At the end of the day, you gotta choose between staying true to yourself or keeping your relationships intact. Now, gender role reversal and deception is a whole different ball game. Why would someone feel the need to ditch their own identity and pretend to be someone else? In Viola's case, it's all about self-preservation. “I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) New in town and scared, Viola pretends to be a man to stay safe. Her plan works, but it cuts her off from the women in her life, leaving her isolated. To make things worse, she's so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Plus, she's dealing with Orsino's unrequited feelings: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261) Now, this might all seem progressive, but to us modern folk, it might be seen as a way to surface hidden emotions, especially for Olivia and Orsino. It's like Shakespeare is saying, hey, maybe they've got feelings they're not aware of yet. Take Olivia, for instance. Is she into Cesario because he's a man or does she secretly fancy women? Probably not, since Olivia seems more like a product of her time, judging people only by their looks. Case in point, she easily switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, treating Cesario/Viola as family instead. “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "So let's delve into the intricacies of German colonial rule. Now, I'm not saying it was all one thing. We're talking about an empire here, and empires are complex beasts. The German colonial empire was a patchwork of policies and governance, as varied as it was vast. But when it comes to education, it was a mixed bag too. In colonies like German East Africa (now Tanzania), the Brits found a literate and educated population. And in Kamerun and other colonies, the Germans got some kudos for their educational efforts. But South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) was a different story. Unlike East Africa, where the government took the reins in educating the locals, in South West Africa, it was largely left to missionary societies with meager government support. Meanwhile, the government invested heavily in European education. This had lingering effects long after German rule ended, with a vast majority of the population remaining uneducated. Social, political, and economic factors were the drivers behind this disparity. This is what I want to explore further, looking at new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere's a ton of literature out there on education in the German colonial empire. Most of it's in German and came out in the early 20th century, either during or soon after the colonial period. Early works were all about describing the educational systems in each colony. Later works in English gave us more detailed comparisons and analyses. These studies highlighted the significant differences between the educational systems. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa is a standout here. Cohen compares the two colonies and discusses the factors behind their educational differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa played a big role in shaping its educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa was moderately temperate, but much of it was arid desert. This attracted a European population—nearly 15,000 whites by 1913. In comparison, East Africa had only 5,336 settlers.",
            "The classification of popular music has evolved significantly over the past 100 years, leading us to a point where listing all the genres and sub-genres can be quite challenging. Genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, for example, have birthed numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, making it even harder to keep track. One such genre that stands out for its diversity and expressiveness is Heavy Metal rock, which has developed into a highly versatile genre over the past 40 years. It’s expressive because it covers a wide range of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker side. Its diversity is evident in the early realization that it offered ample flexibility for experimentation, leading to the creation of various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres that continue to flourish today.\n\nWe’ve reached a point where the Heavy Metal movement has spawned so many unique groups that it's almost impossible to define what Heavy Metal is. It has absorbed themes from other genres, but it has a distinct origin. To understand the metal music of today, one must first grasp what the metal movement is and why it’s considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nHeavy Metal is fundamentally a dark movement. It’s often described as a “music of more”—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. Musicians in metal bands are highly skilled, which is evident in their music. It’s also a movement deeply influenced by drug culture. The mid-70s saw a psychedelic drug boom that led to the creation of crazier, otherworldly music, often using drugs as an excuse for its unique sound. The genre possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which was a new trend at the time, as much of popular music earlier didn’t delve into the darker emotions. Later generations of metal musicians have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like the following showcase the darker side of the movement:\n\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter exhibit the darker side of the Beatles. The song is seen as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, responding to a Rolling Stone song that was also on the heavier, darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove their ability to be as heavy as the Stones, leading to the inclusion of Helter Skelter on their White Album.",
            "So a few decades before the Surrealists started painting their dreamlike masterpieces, there was Henri Rousseau, a man who was figuratively and literally crafting his own dreams. The Dream, a painting from 1910, isn't just a depiction of a woman in awe of a dream landscape; it's a reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. From the start, he dreamt of recognition, acceptance, and praise, but faced a tough internal struggle. Should he conform to existing styles to be accepted or stay true to his unique voice? The Dream captures this lifelong battle: his desire to be part of the art world versus his wish to carve his own path.\n\nTo understand The Dream, we need to know a bit about Rousseau's life. Born in Laval, France, on May 21, 1844, he was a tinsmith's son who never received formal art training. He worked as a gabelou until he was forty, earning the nickname \"douanier\" despite not being a customs inspector. After losing his first wife and many of their children, he turned to painting for solace. Unlike his peers, Rousseau was a folk painter with the hopes and dreams of the common people.\n\nRousseau's quest for acceptance is understandable given his circumstances. Uneducated and starting late, he was painting amidst more famous artists, and his recognition came around the same time as Matisse's rise. Jan Gordon, in Modern French Painters, notes that while they were rivals, they had different motivations. Matisse wanted to avoid clichés, while Rousseau wanted to create something so conventional he’d be accepted.",
            "So many great minds have posited a deep bond between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there's a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats wrote in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— / That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience. Yet, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being formally taught. Both are efforts to describe, rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty often aim to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than setting rules for good art or moral behavior. For instance, discussing da Vinci's Mona Lisa may focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these don't fully capture why it's good art. When asked about a favorite piece, people often say, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more complex explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be fully reduced to their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor put it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Ethics shares this property. As Wittgenstein said, \"Ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this elusive \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and it's this transcendental nature that connects them. I believe morality and art are so closely related because we experience them most powerfully at a noumenal level, as Kant would say. They affect us at a level we can feel but can't fully explain. This link is especially strong with literature. As McKean notes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany, as it stands today, is recognized as a potent force, a united nation with a rich culture that stretches from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This culture is tangible in cities like Cologne, in the heart of Germany, and in Dresden, a Saxon city nestled along the Elbe. Given this diverse cultural tapestry, it's not surprising that Germany, as we know it, has its roots in various sources and tribes.\n\nThe land of the Germans, known as Germania, has a contentious origin story. Some scholars believe the name came from the Germanic tribe called Tungrians, as documented by Tacitus in 98 AD, while others suggest it might come from the Old Irish word meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy. Regardless, the Romans, who first used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish conquered Gauls from unconquered Germanic tribes, would have been surprised to see the Germanic tribes living on the borders of their empire. Initially, the Romans interacted with the Germanic tribes through trade and the occasional military campaign, but mostly returned to their sprawling empire. The Germanic tribes, however, remained, and their influence continued to shape the lands they inhabited.",
            "Staring down, I blankly took in the sight before me. My mind was unemotionally processing the view, silently analyzing it with a practiced precision that refused to relate the object to any abstract understanding. Thoughts flitted in and out of my consciousness almost too quickly to notice. It was as if I was experiencing the scene rather than thinking about it.\nYears ago, an artist I worked with recommended an art instruction book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had always wanted to learn how to draw, and this book promised to teach even the basics of understanding a pencil and how the brain interprets lines. One technique it taught was to place a square frame around any picture to simplify a complex scene. Standing there, I couldn't mentally project that frame onto the bowl of fruit in front of me. I was too overwhelmed, too awed by the prospect of painting. If I had any pretensions to being artistic, this was my first canvas, my first story: \"Work in Brown.\"\nFingertips resting on the brush handle, muscles tensing and relaxing as I moved my hand through space, I was about to capture a moment of creativity. Water circled, clear and calm, crystal clear and clean. Matter broke away and was swept away. My hand hit the handle again, muscles tightening more this time, a little more anxious. The brown package refused to budge. It was stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.\nMop in hand, feet spread apart, tie knotted tightly around my throat, I frowned at the offensive bundle of food waste left for the bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more quiet moments, then my hand reached for the wall, the end of the toilet paper. I wrapped it around my hand until it looked like an oven mitt. Standing up straight, I bent down, my hand slowly entering the bowl, like a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Another tragic trend that's been making headlines lately is the alarming number of teenagers dying behind the wheel. Several factors are at play here, and it's a deadly combination. The National Institutes of Health point out that the teen brain isn't fully mature for driving yet, and this immaturity, combined with sheer inexperience, leads to more fatal crashes, vehicle rollovers, speeding tickets, and off-road incidents. Add to that the fact that teens often drive with friends, which is something anyone with a speck of wisdom knows they do frequently. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found that the number of traffic accidents increases with the age of the passengers in the car.\n\nTo tackle this issue, some states have introduced temporary provisional licenses that restrict teens to drive only during certain hours and ban other minors as passengers. However, these measures are just temporary fixes. The real problem is that, as a group, young drivers just aren't ready to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes that even 18 is too young for a full driver's license. He's found that teens under 19 or 20 often crave excitement and take risks for the thrill of it, and it makes sense to delay driving until these tendencies mellow out. If we keep issuing driver's licenses to young teens, we're looking at more deadly crashes and a potential surge in teen deaths in just a few years. By 2010, the Baby Boomers' children will be eligible to drive, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads.\n\nAddressing this issue through legislation could be relatively simple. Schools could start teaching future drivers, but no one under 18 could actually drive a car. Provisional permits could still be issued, and teens would need to complete a certain number of hours of driving practice with an adult, similar to the requirements in most states. The specific number could be based on the current standards (6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult in California, for example). As the statistics show, teen driving fatalities are a concern across all states, making a uniform national policy a reasonable and effective solution.\n\nThis proposed legislation isn't a groundbreaking idea, but it could make a significant difference in the safety of our young drivers.",
            "So I decided to take a gander at the Library of Congress's collection of Edison's old films, specifically the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films were basically all about creative editing to create illusions. My film study focused on describing the poetic elements of most trick films and examining the unique characteristics of a few of the later ones. The trick films of the time were pretty much confined to a set, framed within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, long and medium shots, and sticking to the one shot, one film rule.\n\nBut some of these films at the beginning of the twentieth century were bold enough to break these rules by introducing aspects like multiple shots. One thing that stood out in these trick films was their filming style. They were shot in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera didn't move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects, drawing from the theatre and vaudeville tradition. Figures in trick films generally only moved side-to-side, not towards or away from the camera. For instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right and moved back and forth along the horizontal axis, without the camera following them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium setup also meant that shots were typically long shots or, less often, medium shots. Close-ups were never used in any of the Edison trick films. This again was borrowed from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. Since actors didn't move towards the camera, close-ups were non-existent.\n\nMost of these early trick films followed the pattern of one conceptual shot equaling a film. This usually kept the films short, about a minute or less, and limited their dramatic or narrative use. They mainly focused on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing, and switching acts, with little story. However, what appeared to be one conceptual shot to the viewer actually wasn't necessarily one physical shot. A single \"shot\" could be made up of several joined together to create illusions like apparition or disappearing. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) as an example. A closer look reveals that the physical shot with Mary's \"head\" starts, even though the film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate supporter of the Republican cause. Despite being primarily a farmer, his time in politics and his commitment to his profession instilled in him a deep dedication to personal liberty and the principles of government. His devotion to an agrarian lifestyle shaped nearly all of his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique opportunity to establish a perfect system because no native traditions hindered its founding, allowing for a government of self-governance. He held firm beliefs in the interdependence of natural rights and the need for them to be beyond government control. He argued that those with physical strength and cunning took advantage in a state of nature, but in civilization, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must account for human nature’s inherent good and evil. He was rigid in his dualistic morality, stating, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He considered principles that protected private property, improved agriculture, and discouraged capitalism as good, and believed a government founded on these principles would function fairly despite its corruptible administration.\n\nTaylor, like many of his contemporaries, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a minimal Federal government, only granting it powers explicitly stated in the Constitution. He acknowledged that an expansive Federal government could become tyrannical due to its cost, but he also cautioned that a simple, literal interpretation could lead to corruption without considering the founders' intent. The Declaration of Independence, he believed, was the true charter of the United States, as it explicitly described the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, we noticed a significant drop in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project. This was quite disheartening, and it's tough to pinpoint the exact cause. With winter setting in at the New England campus, commuting by bicycle or on foot naturally declined. December also marks the end of the fall semester, a time when everyone is busy with schoolwork and grading. Filling out the commuter log might have gotten lost in the shuffle. Plus, December brings the holiday season, often resulting in a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, which might have contributed to the low log submissions for that month. However, February's low submissions remain unexplained. The project might just have experienced an initial burst of energy that naturally faded. To boost engagement, we organized the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which did indeed increase log submissions. This highlights the challenge of maintaining project momentum during natural engagement dips and holiday/semester breaks. Another hurdle for this project, or any similar initiative, is the deeply ingrained culture of driving personal cars for commuting. To encourage alternative commuting, we offered gift certificates to local businesses like restaurants, coffee shops, a bookstore, and even national chains. It would have been interesting to see the impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars. If we had gradually increased the prize value over time, it might have boosted participation and engagement. The gift cards were effective at the start, but announcing larger prizes in December and January could have sustained and possibly even increased participation.",
            "Another financial tool to consider is an ETF, or exchange-traded fund. Unlike index funds, ETFs offer more flexibility and trade like individual stocks on an exchange. They bring the diversification of an index fund and the perks of owning a single stock, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share. The advantages are clear, but so are some drawbacks. Like stocks, ETFs charge commissions on trades, and while their expense ratios are lower than mutual funds, they can still add up.\n\nA savvy investor should assess whether the benefits of owning an ETF, like diversification, truly exist and to what extent. For this effort, let's examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. The top 10 holdings are listed below along with their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge how well these top 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, let's calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, normalized to 100%. The results of these calculations are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase. Additionally, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. Initially, it seems a portfolio of the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower Beta. However, the statistical significance of these portfolios may not be different.\n\nTo determine if the portfolios are statistically different, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Another one of Edgar Allan Poe's notable works is \"Dream-Land,\" which he himself considered one of his better poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which, according to Mabbott, traces back to Virgil's writings. Virgil used this term to refer to an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world by the Greeks. While it is certain that Virgil did use the term, there is a more contemporary source to which credit may also be given. Poe had a keen interest in German authors, especially the works of Goethe.\n\nThis is significant because it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" discusses the similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe was likely influenced by Goethe's work.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a celebrated writer, particularly known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second in the year of his death, 1832. Within the second part of Faust, there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells the story of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet as a gift. After her death, the king becomes consumed with drinking and grief, ultimately deciding to end his life. He gives away all his possessions to his children, except for the goblet, which he throws into the sea before deleting himself from the cliff. The descriptions of the King of Thule and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, suggesting a dark reflection of Poe's own experiences and struggles with substance abuse.\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his collected works. He uses the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but he also employs the term \"Thule\" as bookends for \"Dream-Land.\" \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule, which is dark, lonely, and haunted by the memory of dead friends. The lack of color in the world mirrors the gloom of the King of Thule's situation after the loss of his wife. The entire poem is as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a significant author whose work Poe would have known, if for no other reason than his admiration for Tennyson. When asked if he admired Tennyson, Poe expressed that, aside from their connection, he would have been exposed to Goethe's work through numerous reproductions of his original publications.",
            "In the case of Jennifer Palmer suing D&D Markets, California law may allow her to seek punitive damages if she can prove the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with malicious intent. Palmer needs to show that Martin was aware of the potential harm from the applesauce spill and deliberately disregarded it. Martin was informed about the spill twice, but he failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner. This could be considered malicious if he knew the previous incidents involving slip-and-fall injuries and chose not to act. Palmer's claim that Martin's actions were despicable is weaker but still reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009.",
            "CBC was the place where I first delved into the teachings of Islam, four years ago now. The heated debates sparked in class about whether or not Islam is inherently hostile were as relevant then as they are today, perhaps even more so. Since 9/11, I've witnessed the media's view of Islam shifting from outright hostility towards extremists to an almost extreme tolerance. I doubt that, back in 2001, an American presidential candidate with an obvious Muslim background like Barack Obama could have been a possibility.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography has always intrigued me, as it seems to present a stark contrast to the historical accounts I've read. According to the biography, Muhammad is portrayed as a martyr and a humble figure who, rather than forcibly converting others, saw people come to him seeking the truth in his teachings. This depiction, however, doesn't align with the historical narrative of Muhammad's rise to power. It's as if the biography is trying to elevate Muhammad to a godly figure, portraying him as wise, gentle, and humble. Yet, history contradicts this, and I can't help but wonder if modern Muslims are aware of the true historical context surrounding Muhammad's rise.\n\nMoreover, there are uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad that intrigue me. For instance, the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men bears a striking resemblance to Jesus' miracle of feeding the five thousand. This style of writing, I believe, is an attempt to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who, through his actions and teachings, demonstrates the truth without needing to prove anything. This approach, however, diminishes the life and miracles of Jesus, making it seem like they are borrowing credit from his life.\n\nThe biography also includes numerous stories that aim to provide 'witnesses' to the conversion of people to Islam. However, many of these tales are told from a third-party perspective, such as the author hearing the story from someone who heard it from another person. I found this approach to be less convincing, as it often diminishes the stories' credibility by adding layers of uncertainty. It's as if the authors were trying to build a case for the truth of the stories, but the third-party nature of many of them makes it seem more like a string of hearsay.\n\nWhat troubles me the most about this work is the attempt to portray Muhammad as a godly, humble, and wise figure. This portrayal contradicts historical accounts of Muhammad's rise to power and makes me question whether modern Muslims are aware of the historical context surrounding his life.",
            "So, the teachings of Jesus, the beliefs he held during his lifetime, were quickly left behind as Christianity evolved after his passing. Looking at this from a broad perspective, it's clear that Christianity has drifted further and further from its origins over time. Today, we see a growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive trend. While traditional people persist and may resist any new thinking, they might not be enough to influence the entire population. Among believers, a historical awareness will undoubtedly grow in future years. There will be a longing to distinguish the doctrines added to Christianity over time from what Jesus originally intended. It may take decades or even centuries, but the end result will be inevitable: a return to the religion's original form. A movement will emerge, growing in numbers, and will peel away layers of doctrine, one by one, like a clock winding backward. When this trend reaches the United States and Europe, it will influence many to worship as if they were living during Jesus' time, following only his ideas. The church, as an institution, will remain strong to guide this path. However, as the theological clock reverses, the extreme diversity within Christendom will reduce to greater uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions, we'll see increasing similarities instead of differences. Human history is filled with such reversals. For example, Christians were once persecuted and killed by the Roman Empire, but the empire later became a Christian institution. Our country has transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversal coming in the future will play out in the realm of Christianity, undoing history and diversity in the process. A key part of what will enable this process is interpreting Jesus' words as metaphorical, rather than literal statements. So, what has happened since Jesus' lifetime?\n       If we delve deep into history, we find that Judaism was the theological foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, the belief in a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were at the core of the religion by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not unified in spirit, dividing into groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots, along with a majority of common people.",
            "I believe that \"The Jungle\" illustrates how, deep down, humans are inherently selfish and focused solely on their own prosperity. They strive to make their lives as comfortable and successful as possible, without considering the well-being of those less fortunate. This is evident in the owners and managers of the massive factories, who are solely driven by the desire to expand their enterprises, often at the expense of others. They disregard any collateral damage caused by their relentless pursuit of growth. Upton Sinclair vividly portrays this with his description, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery highlights the environmental devastation and the callous disregard for all life forms affected by the factories. The owners and managers also prioritize profits over their employees' welfare, subjecting them to grueling work conditions without any concern for their well-being or safety. They exploit their workers, often firing them without notice or compensation, as there were few regulations or protections for labor in that era. Sinclair's portrayal of the workers as \"slaves\" underscores the inhuman treatment they endured, with no recourse or support systems in place. Even when unions were formed, they often worsened the situation by exploiting the workers themselves. The unchecked power of the owners and managers, combined with the desperation of the workers, resulted in a system that was as oppressive and exploitative as chattel slavery.",
            "Many authors employ various methods to evoke specific feelings or attitudes towards significant topics. Some techniques work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes many of these methods in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" One approach he often uses is combining an adjective and a noun that don't typically go together to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. Another technique is investing meaning in symbols and using them repeatedly for the same purpose. Fitzgerald employs the latter technique with several colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel, Fitzgerald assigns meanings to colors like white/gray and red/pink, and later uses these meanings to reinforce a particular feeling around important objects.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald assigns to white/gray is uniformity, with white representing a higher, more refined status, and gray signifying age and decay. He establishes this meaning early in the novel by frequently using both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as “in white” (8), and even Nick wears “white flannels” (41) at Gatsby’s party. Tom is in a “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). The only time people aren’t wearing white is when Nick observes Gatsby’s party: “the halls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald also uses these colors to depict common, unimportant subjects: as Nick heads to work, he descends “the white chasms of lower New York” (56), and the names of people at Gatsby’s parties become “gray names” (61) on his schedule. Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses” (28), and plain or common people and places are described as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a “white girlhood” (19), there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\n\nAfter imbuing these colors with meaning, Fitzgerald uses them to symbolize unimportance or uniformity in subjects. This technique begins with Daisy. After a long period with little significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster” (74); readers start to perceive Daisy as less of a character and more like a uniform, something that Gatsby desires and yearns for. Fitzgerald employs this method often to emphasize Daisy’s uniformity, such as with a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18) and her wearing “white” (115) before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",
            "Another thing I've been doing is researching the land around San Diego. It's got a great climate for farming, so it's no surprise that it's super productive. You can find all sorts of stuff there like tomatoes, citrus fruits, and all sorts of greens. There's a big market for organic produce too, with many local supporters lined up. Plus, they do tours and let you enjoy the outdoors. Sounds like a sweet deal, right? But it's not all sunshine and roses. Organic farming can be pricey because you've got to put in extra work to keep things pest-free and healthy without using chemicals. And the land I found on a real estate website? It's a big piece of chaparral, grassland, and oak forest next to a national forest. It's home to some rare critters, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. There's a conservation plan for the area that's still being worked on, but it's got over a hundred species on the list. The land has a history too - it was used by Native Americans and later by cattle ranchers. I'm looking into government programs to see if I can get some help to make the farm more profitable and wildlife-friendly.",
            "Culture plays a significant part in any negotiation. Culture is more about what it isn't than what it is, and its significance can vary greatly. It's not one-size-fits-all, and generalizations like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are too broad and oversimplified. While understanding general cultural traits is helpful, it's more important to grasp how a culture's attitudes and values impact negotiations and how to adapt to them. When encountering a foreign culture, one tends to relate it to their own, making comparisons inevitable. Understanding a foreign culture or mindset can involve delving into its history and recognizing its prejudices. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, one should simply accept it and work within its parameters, especially if you're at a weaker bargaining position. If you're in a \"foreign\" environment, respecting local traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt's also crucial to note that culture isn't just about national or international differences. Within a single nation, many companies have their own corporate cultures. These can vary widely, with some emphasizing long hours, while others foster a more relaxed work schedule. You can see these differences in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some companies encourage employee philanthropy at any level, while others limit it to \"company-approved\" causes. Even within the U.S., corporate cultures can vary greatly, from region to region and from urban to suburban environments. Some cultures may appear more uniform to outsiders, but it's essential to look deeper.\n\nValues are particularly important to understand because they explain why a culture is the way it is. If saving face or communal harmony is valued in a culture, a negotiator won't publicly shame their company or superiors to succeed. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes a hard-driven bargain won't rush to settle. It's crucial to consider these generalizations before sitting down at the table, but also to learn something about your opponent's personal background to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, \"There is no God.\" This quote, found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, is the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about the existence of God. Interestingly, this sentiment is shared by another author we'll discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Both of their arguments aim to prove the existence of the same concept of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To simplify, we must assume they both believe in this God. However, neither truly provides a complete basis for belief in God.\n\nLet's first look at St. Anselm's argument. He suggests that understanding God comes from within our own hearts. He argues that since God exists within our understanding, we cannot conceive of his non-existence. This concept, although worded convolutedly, basically means that proof for God lies within our own minds. We don't need to search beyond our inner selves for evidence; the truth about God is found by exploring what we inherently know. This idea is often called faith within Christian literature.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas believes that God's existence can be proven through logic and empirical evidence, without relying on faith. Such a stance is advantageous for converting new believers, as it allows for recruitment without needing people to accept unprovable concepts. Aquinas presents five logical arguments to support this claim: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He shows that the proof of God's existence lies in the logical necessity for him. If you know you're missing a puzzle piece, you can deduce the features and existence of the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Sometime around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned the world and attained enlightenment, leading to the birth of Buddhism—with the most traditional sect being Theravada Buddhism. The religion is nearly twenty-five hundred years old, and it has evolved significantly from its original form. This can be seen in Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Monks and laypeople alike take part, despite Buddha never having taught about such a ritual. These changes range from superficial traditions to the religion's core beliefs. Both monastic and lay Theravada Buddhists have had to adjust their doctrinal principles over time, due to both internal and external influences, both friendly and hostile.\n\nThis discussion will use several key terms. Internal forces are those that originate from within the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. External forces are those from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, born of a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces are those that don't intend to harm or help, but may do so as a side effect. These terms will be used frequently in this discussion.\n\nTo understand the religion, we must first explore its core doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is made up of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka includes all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka sets out rules for life, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka deals with the religion's metaphysical components. These include concepts like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering, and Anicca—impermanence. Only by accepting these ideas can one escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and overcome lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka contains rules for life, such as the five precepts for laypeople and many more for monks. The most fundamental principle of Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico once shared a long-standing rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145) describe this rivalry, with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 being its peak. During this conflict, the United States attacked and won, gaining Texas and the American Southwest. The rivalry was fueled by differences in religion, culture, and tradition, as well as a clash of material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). This isn't uncommon among neighboring nations. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes, “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41). Mexico and Cuba, being geographically close to the United States, have historically been rivals, unlike other Latin American nations that have maintained good relations with the United States. Religious differences, similar to the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, played a significant role in this rivalry. Sally Frahm (2001) states, “If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy” (p. 86). The distrust between the English and Spanish, a legacy from colonial times, further strained relations. Diehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes during this 57-year period, most of which were territorial issues involving border raids and frontier problems. Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry's decline began when Mexico became more dependent on the United States, and it ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly struck down by an illness that I had never known existed.\n\nAt the time, I was a nurse. I had chosen this profession due to a deep-seated need for the safety and security that I had lacked as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" was the mantra I heard repeatedly as I grew older. Thus, even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist, perhaps a mix of both, I chose nursing.\n\nNow, here I am, 46 years old, single, and without much money in the bank, unable to work. I am still disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I have virtually nothing left that I can call my own. I manage to get by, but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, yet, there is one thing I know for certain. I could not have made it through all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. And let me tell you, when real disaster strikes, you do not feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life, big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well one prepares, some things are just too big to overcome on your own.\n\nI concur wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's \"basket\"; Lord knows it is moldy and falling apart, anyway. Yet, I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again—learning to help each other and to ask for help, rather than having each of us individually scrambling out to the backyard to build fallout shelters.\n\nThe Conservatives in the U.S. talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism; it was compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and an array of batteries, candles, and waterproof matches, as well as canned goods. If you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food—do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you are at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Alright, so, why do organisms evolve the way they do? Are there certain rules or limits that guide the path of evolutionary change? Well, back in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson said that even then, scientists were barely scratching the surface of defining organic forms mathematically. Fast forward to today, and we're using math to understand mollusks' skeleton growth over time through both individual development and across generations. Our research is all about blending mathematical modeling with experiments to figure out how growth and size changes happen. We used X-ray images of Prunum species to spot key measurements and entered them into a software called CerioShell. By creating hypothetical shell shapes, we're exploring the limits of possible changes in Prunum. And we're combining this with experiments and descriptions to better grasp the big picture of evolution in this group.\n\nImagine a shell as a tube that wraps around a central axis called the columella, spinning in 360-degree loops called whorls. The speed at which these whorls grow varies, and a continuous line separates each one, known as a suture. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, called the body whorl, and the rest are part of the spire. The shell's tip is called the apex, and the other end is the base. The animal exits through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be seen from different angles: apical, basal, apertural, or abapertural. The most common way to view a shell is apertural, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, start by looking at the shell from the apical view, find the first suture, and draw a line through it. Count whorls from there, estimating to a quarter of a whorl as needed.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. You can trace this path using the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture. This trajectory can be shown both graphically and mathematically. Once you have a mathematical formula, you can tweak parameters to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "So, another decade has rolled by, and it seems life in Indonesia, at least when it comes to neonatal and infant mortality, has been rather stagnant. The nation's progress in meeting the Millennium Development Goals is noteworthy, with marked improvements in water and sanitation. However, the pace of progress in reducing child and maternal health issues is far from where it needs to be by 2015. Let's delve into the reasons behind these shortcomings and why we should focus on strengthening the overall health system rather than just tweaking specific programs.\n\nA positive sign is that 72% of births now see a skilled health worker, but this includes traditional workers like midwives who can't handle complications. This improvement is misleading, as there's still much work to be done. Additionally, the treatment of diarrheal cases in children under five has decreased, and postnatal care is an area of concern with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarian-section rates are still dismally low at 4%, with urban areas at 7% and rural areas at just 2%, indicating a severe equity gap in healthcare access. This disparity is further exacerbated by a 27% gap in service utilization between the richest and poorest quintiles, suggesting that the poor struggle to access healthcare services likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care, the most crucial question is how to best address the lack of service. Should Indonesia focus on program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system? Programmatic approaches are appealing due to their targeted, manageable nature and faster results. However, investing heavily in one area may starve other sectors of funding and resources, leading to a duplication of uncoordinated services and an increase in administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels diverge from the norm by incorporating elements of mystery and the bizarre, which serve to enrich the characters and provide deeper insights into their motivations and emotions. Both works employ dream sequences or dreamlike states to convey this sense of mystery, though the specifics vary in each case.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often unveil Oliver's inner turmoil, revealing what troubles him and his awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event vividly, as if in a dream, while struggling to find help. This passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events and his dire physical condition, as reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself leaves Oliver overwhelmed, his senses numbed as he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" that bears him away; he experiences his despair anew, removed from the initial shock of pain, as the pain becomes constant and linked with fear rather than surprise. The question arises as to whose will brought about his misfortune, as it certainly wasn't his own. This shooting underscores Oliver's limited control over his circumstances, even as his life is in danger. Furthermore, it suggests a growing sense of defeat, as if Fagin has begun to break him, compelling him to accept this despair and influencing his ability to react. It can be assumed that if Oliver were not resigned to this despair, he would have made at least a minimal effort to save himself.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "Back in the day, I worked as a tutor for an after-school program, helping elementary kids with their homework. While I excelled in English and reading, I was recruited to assist a kid named Adrian, who was having a rough time with reading. Initially, it seemed like he had peculiar reading problems, but it turned out his issue was that he could read, but he didn't know the English alphabet well. I finally realized this when his mom walked in, speaking only Spanish. With my fledgling Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. That day, I understood Adrian's struggle, and I hope he's doing better now. I share this story to highlight the language barrier in schools, particularly in California. It's not always as evident as we think, and even kids who speak perfect English can struggle with reading due to alphabet and pronunciation issues. The solution isn't simple; it requires a combination of approaches, like dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes. For Adrian, tutoring in English reading and pronunciation was effective, but for kids who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. The key is combining all these methods to address the language barrier effectively.",
            "From childhood, many of us are taught that something larger than ourselves exists, something we can't comprehend. Some of us learn about it through Sunday school or religious institutions, while others look within themselves or reject it altogether, embracing our own egocentric universe. Each of us defines our spirituality through our unique perspectives, searching for light in the darkness to guide us. When my father passed away, he was, in many ways, already gone. I chose not to witness his departure, preferring to remember him through his life rather than his death. I couldn't let the knowledge of his passing make it more real for both of us, so I curled up in a ball in my bed, waiting for the news. No one called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel,\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, is essentially an \"old-new\" oxymoron. The Gothic mode has been both criticized and celebrated, accused of lacking depth, and praised for its 'terrible sublime' quality (Burke). The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, merged ideas from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new literary approach. Walpole combined old theatrical elements and modern mimicry of nature in his 'modern' novels, presenting what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often incorporates throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to modern societal and literary advancements. The blend of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" style and the new novel format, which allowed readers a more personal view of character psychology, kept Gothic relevant for a long time, making it both obsolete and new to readers far removed from the original time.\n\nOne of the key themes in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, or the training of a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it represents the classic knight—brave, honorable, competent—and the perceived lack of that ideal in their contemporary society. Through chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the genre's evolution towards Romanticism, and used to try and improve the present. Walpole, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, was living in a politically tumultuous era and grappling with the possibility of a troubled future. Immersed in politics and unfair accusations, he may have begun to believe, if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" of people in the Gothic era had been lost in the individuals making up the 'present' society. This sentiment is evident in several characters, one being Frederic. The reader learns about Frederic before meeting him, and he embodies many chivalric traits: he is a prince, has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently thought to be killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, bringing into play the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the chain of events that moves goods from an initial customer order through to the stage of raw materials, production, distribution, and final delivery to the customer. The term \"supply chain management\" was coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant, who described it as the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what happens in the supply chain to meet customers' needs efficiently. This process revolves around six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to ensure optimal customer service.\n\nThe first crucial step in the supply chain is production. Production is foundational to the entire process. Managers must understand what customers want, which can be gauged by studying the market. The market's demands influence what products should be produced and in what quantities. Once the market study is complete, managers determine where and which plant would be best for production, considering volume and quality requirements. The next step is scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Each detail in production is vital, and any oversight can result in significant time and money losses. For instance, I previously worked at Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business had a designated process, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks. These outlined processes ensure smooth operations and clarity in expectations.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply, which involves strategic decisions to shape the core capabilities of a facility and form partnerships for outsourcing. A company may have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with unique equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division best fits the product's processes. Outsourcing can also be a strategy to create velocity, which is the ability to offer high-quality and flexible services while minimizing costs.",
            "The sign reads: \"Hitler lives on in Burma.\" Ellen Page, the actor from the movie Juno, stands alone on a city street with a cardboard sign held high, the chilling message written in Sharpie. Burma, or Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a brutal military junta that seized control in 1962 following a coup d'état. In 2007, a series of public protests known as \"The Saffron Revolution\" erupted, sparked by monks. Initially, the government tolerated these peaceful gatherings, but the violence soon escalated as the military attacked monasteries nation-wide. Foreign journalists were arrested, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed during a protest on September 27th, 2007. The official death toll stands at 13, but a defected colonel claims many more were killed, numbering potentially in the thousands.\n\nThis isn't a new trend. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. Early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were considered gods, and even our current president, George W. Bush, allegedly holds weekly meetings with Ted Haggard of Stupid People Worldwide, a branch of the Republican Party.\n\nNotable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protest, where intellectuals, workers, and students gathered to challenge the government's authoritarian rule, with death tolls ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s involved Hutu militias and the government systematically killing Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler's \"Third Reich\" was a period of systematic persecution and murder of individuals of Jewish background across multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz is greatly due to his longevity and the creative prowess he brought to his orchestra. Often seen as a subtle pianist in many of his compositions, Ellington excelled in composing rich and complex pieces that highlighted each band member's unique abilities. He established a framework where soloists could freely improvise, writing tightly orchestrated sections that showcased each player's style. This not only emphasized the tone of the orchestra but also created a unique and coherent sound for every piece. Ellington's mastery of individual players' sounds, as well as how they blended together into a cohesive ensemble, resulted in some of jazz's most innovative and brilliant works. The Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's use of voice as a jazz instrument, exemplified in Creole Love Call, where he utilized the voice to add texture and color without lyrics. This piece is notable for its six choruses, each featuring different instrumental sections and soloists, demonstrating Ellington's ability to complement his soloists' styles. In Hot and Bothered and It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington continued to excel at tight orchestration and tone color, using unique combinations of vocal and instrumental elements to create rich, complementary sounds.",
            "She had always felt this gnawing emptiness, a longing that couldn't be satisfied. It began when she was 14, just starting to navigate teenage life, and it persisted at 17. She had come to realize she desired a certain someone rather than some material possession, but no boy had caught her interest. Several had tried to woo her, with varying degrees of clumsiness, but none sparked the spark she craved. She often pondered this peculiar situation, wondering what could be the cause. Years of introspection offered theories, but nothing concrete enough to give her any clarity. So, she continued living her life, perpetually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually serene and peaceful. Her parents were calm and harmonious, rarely arguing with each other or her. The only disputes were over her asserting her independence and unique personality. They were fond of her for her lively spirit, which complemented their laid-back nature, making her well-liked and nice.\n\nToday, however, was not a typical peaceful day. As she moved from room to room, searching for inspiration, a sudden shriek from the kitchen pierced the air. She rushed in to find her mother lying on the floor, in obvious pain. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she cried out in panic. Her mother managed to whisper, \"Ouch...sweetie...I...need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her daughter quickly sprang into action, helped her mother into the car, and drove them to the nearest hospital.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the familiar scent of disinfectant and the underlying aroma of sickness. She wasn't focused on that, though; her mind was consumed with worrying about her mother. She rushed her mother to the nearest doctor, who immediately set to work. Her daughter was left to wait, her heart pounding with anxiety.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a ladder while trying to reach a high cabinet. The doctor's assessment was clear: her mother needed critical care.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed), is linked to reduced chances of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is a tweaked version of the Med diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, while also lowering intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is allowed.\n\nPrevious research found an inverse relationship between following the Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular mortality (CVD), and showed that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in overweight individuals. However, these studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Every six years from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). More than 95% of nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year period. FFQs were validated, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Cases without available records were considered \"probable\" and included, with around 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts classified this way. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, with leisure-time physical activity assessed starting in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated. Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could confuse results) by considering age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the association between the aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, there were 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "Well, you know what happened in '07, it was a complete financial meltdown. Jobless rates soared, the housing market tanked, and many big shots in business were left in the dust. We've been feeling the effects ever since. I reckon we should ask ourselves, how did it all go south, and how can we avoid it happening again? Now, the crisis was cooked up by politicians who were pushing banks to give out sub-prime loans, even though the financial system wasn't ready. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were also under pressure to back these mortgages and then resell them as CDOs and CDSs. When people started defaulting on these loans, the banks were left high and dry, and it all cascaded into a full-blown economic disaster.\n\nThe seeds of this mess were sown back in '99 during the Clinton era. The President was eyeing a second term, and he wanted to boost his popularity. So, he relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime fiasco just seven years later. Steven Holmes, writing for the New York Times, warned back then, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest mortgage underwriter, was facing increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgages for low and moderate-income people and from stockholders to keep growing profits.” Holmes was right on the mark: ill-advised lending would indeed bring about the economic meltdown.\n\nA lot of things combined to send the economy into a spin. Mortgages were getting more complicated, with adjustable rates, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs becoming common. This only made the housing market more interconnected with the rest of the economy, leaving people and financial markets vulnerable to any little price changes.\n\nAnd then, the housing bubble burst. Banks that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left with nothing but sour faces. The top five U.S. investment banks reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007—that's about 30% of the USA's GDP. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch got sold off cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks, all under intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were in $5 trillion worth of mortgage debt and were put under government control in September 2008. It was a mess, and it all started with some bad political decisions.",
            "So here we are, exposition time. That's the part where you spread your writer's wings and either captivate or bore your readers. Dr. Merlin, she's known to shout at her monitor when caught in the throes of Too Much Information, and not in the fun kind of way either.\n\nWe all know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still finds herself in the muck of long-winded text where nothing much happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is that little devil on your shoulder telling you to get the history out of the way to get to the good stuff, not to be confused with the devil on the other shoulder who wants you to dump every detail of your characters' pasts onto your audience.\n\nExposition means just telling the audience what happened, typically in straightforward prose. In movies, it's when one character pours out a bunch of info to another, like the Ancient Mariner. In fiction, the author does the pouring.\n\nConsider this: you're reading along and are told the heroine met her love at such a place and time, they were married in a grand fashion, and he was murdered in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to stretch over two pages, with only a handful of lines of dialogue. You'd expect a bit more than just the bare facts—some insight into how he loved her, how she changed because of him. You'd mourn his death with her, and thus, become more connected to her character.\n\nIn short, you'd expect some meat on the simple bone of the story: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, presses on*) It's tempting to rush past certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he was once in the Air Force, now runs a gas station at night, has been married twice, no kids, loves fishing on weekends, and dreams of owning the station someday, just had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nBut you gotta slow down and provide those details. Show us who he is, not just tell us.",
            "I caught two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, today (August 13, 2011). The first was a \"live\" segment on NBC 4. The lead story was about a guy named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who stabbed his wife – they didn't mention her name. His mug shot was shown, and he had an eerie look about him. They only spent about two minutes on this story, which seemed appropriate given it was still developing.\n\nThe second story was about the shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and there were no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was investigating. This story felt short, and I suspect that might be due to the fact that it involved a \"black\" man or a black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that minorities are often overlooked when they're victims of crimes. If it were a \"white\" child or adult, the media would go crazy, but for a minority, it's lucky if it's even mentioned.\n\nNext up, they discussed a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where the incident might have occurred, and it was determined to be a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a five-thousand-dollar reward for tips leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThen, they talked about rain and thunderstorms expected for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned the temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The story was a bit short, but it was used as a teaser to keep us tuned in.\n\nThey also ran a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man in a hoodie sweatshirt, about six feet tall and 150 pounds. They devoted an unusual amount of time talking about his race and how dark he was, which felt excessive.\n\nFinally, they mentioned a convicted drug kingpin named Rene Rodriguez. He was a Hispanic man from Texas, convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio. Instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years in prison, they said \"300\" months. I'm not sure why they did that, perhaps to make it sound harsher. They also mentioned his Hispanic background, which I don't think was really relevant to the story.",
            "There is an unbreakable bond between brothers, a connection that is as complex as it is profound. This bond carries with it a range of emotions - love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers, more than anyone else, understand each other deeply. They can see themselves reflected in their brother's eyes, seeing not how others perceive them, but their true selves. It's in moments of crisis that this bond truly shines, revealing the good and the bad. When these feelings surface, they come with a hefty price tag. Understanding these emotions, and their consequences, is part of appreciating the weight of this fraternal connection. When a brother looks at you, they see not just you, but your essence. Their actions and the outcomes of those actions unveil their true character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the journey of two brothers. Through their interactions and the narrator's perspective, the intense emotions that accompany this bond are vividly depicted. The protagonist's feelings are dominated by one emotion: pride. From their first adventure together to their final, tragic outing, the protagonist feels resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He dreams of teaching Doodle all the skills he knows, like holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing Old Woman Swamp vines. He wants a brother to race with to Horsehead Landing and to perch with in the great pine tree. These dreams are shattered when Doodle's weak heart condition is revealed. The protagonist is filled with anger, even considering suffocating Doodle with a pillow. Yet, his heart softens when Doodle smiles at him. This moment of weakness in his conviction shows the love he has, albeit hidden, for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex, innovative information processor. As technology evolved from primitive to contemporary times, so did the analogies used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and most recently, a computer. As you delve into the brain, remember that these metaphors are limited in their usefulness and can lead to misconceptions. Information processing begins with input from the senses, converting physical sensations such as touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. The sensory data is continually transformed by the brain's algorithms, both through bottom-up and top-down processes. For instance, when you see a black box against a white background, bottom-up processing helps determine the object's simple properties like color, orientation, and edges. Top-down processing speeds up recognition by using decisions made from previous steps. This could help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the background. Once data is processed, an attention filter decides its importance and which cognitive processes should access it. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. However, you might pick out your name in a noisy room. Numerous processing stages exist, with results modulated by attention repeatedly. To process information, the brain must first store it. Various memory types include sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information is encoded uniquely for each sensory stimulus type, such as structurally for printed words, phonemically for sounds, or semantically for meanings. Once stored, information must be maintained, and studies suggest working memory uses electrical signals looping through neurons for a short period. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in specific protein structures. Several models describe how knowledge is organized in the brain, including those based on human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as nodes linked by their relatedness. For example, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes a critical stance against the impending threat of both technology and the capitalist system that supports it, as depicted in his dystopian novel Brave New World. The people in this society prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to pursue immediate gratification. The citizens are essentially pawns in a grand game, controlled by the World Controller who dictates their ideology. Analyzing the novel through the lens of Marxist criticism, we find that Huxley's reservations about the development of these systems are evident. Terms like homogenization and reification reinforce the idea that the novel is a commentary on the flaws in the emerging economy during Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the concept of false consciousness, a Marxist thesis. Essentially, common citizens are prevented from understanding their true economic relations to other classes, as they are primarily focused on their own interests. This is a result of ideological control over the proletariat and the laboring classes, evident in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The various social classes, such as Delta and Gamma, lack any real will of their own, as their drive to consume and indulge is strengthened through hypnopædia. This manipulation is carried out by the World Controller. Hegemony, the idea that one social class is dominated by another, is clearly present here. The lower classes are completely unaware of this manipulation, essentially 'buying into an ideology that supports the structure' (i.e., capitalism and consumerism). Even the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, typically accept their place, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions between the social classes also indicate the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are shallow and lack depth. Characters, even the major ones, are not well-defined, suggesting that technology and capitalism together may deprive people of their free will and expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, with interactions kept superficial. Males often comment on women's physical attributes, while females discuss their encounters. This superficiality indicates the socioeconomic effect of capitalism. The absolute obedience of each societal class to their role in the community reflects Marxist thoughts on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority so long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for nearly two and a half years, which is four and a half semesters. Getting around campus can be a real challenge. During my freshman year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm, the farthest from the center of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in places like Willard building, which is near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially on days when the weather was bad. I talked to an older alum who told me that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by vast empty fields. Now, those spaces are filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and the new health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to grow, navigating from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. What's the best solution to this mobility problem? The answer is bicycles. But having a bike doesn't solve all problems. Students need to ride them regularly, and the campus needs to be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nJust the other day, I was chatting with a friend who recently started cycling again after taking a break. He said, \"Bikes are fantastic! For a few years, they weren't the coolest thing to ride, but they're the only way to commute around.\" Cycling is not only good for your body but also the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus, just as far from the center as some dorms are. The best decision I made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have a class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding my bike can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. However, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas from my house, and it's not always an easy road to navigate, whether by bike or on foot. There are certainly benefits to walking, but I barely have time for that. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day. That's more than two and a half hours each week. Add to that the time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on. That's more time than I can spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In my quest to become a social worker, I aim to focus on the Division of Family and Children Services. My goal is to support children who have been abused or neglected and offer assistance to troubled families. The values I bring to this field are service, respect, an ethical nature, and a commitment to improving relationships and my own professional competence. These values are not just beneficial to the social work field; they are integral to my personal being.\n\nI've always had a strong desire to help others, but I was uncertain about the career path I wanted to take. Throughout high school and college, I observed many individuals dodging their problems and employing subpar coping mechanisms. Witnessing these situations led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Even after graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I was still uncertain about my career. During a summer break, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. He was there to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I found out he had called the police to his parents' residence. I drove over to help and privately explained my concerns to the police. They requested that I speak with the parents, as there was nothing the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and blamed their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outsiders. This experience made me consider a career in social work to help children with \"simple\" family disputes.\n\nAnother crucial value for social work is social justice. While society claims to value each individual, the concept of “the individual” is often more aligned with traditional norms than actual uniqueness. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and refuse to limit myself to be like others. Throughout my schooling, I protested against social injustice: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothes that reflected my personality, piercing my ears beyond the norm, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and fighting against racism and discrimination. I stand for social justice and will continue to protest against social injustice.",
            "So, this paper dives into the Biological and Sociocultural models concerning the disorder insomnia. The biological model zooms in on genetic info passed down, as well as the medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models, on the other hand, explore environmental relationships and their implications on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review examines insomnia through these models, breaking down each piece of research related to them and explaining it better. We’ll also critique the research findings and point out their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to another mental disorder, or sleep disorders due to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while sleep disorders linked to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other sleep disorders can stem from medical complications or substance use. Dyssomnias, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, each have their specific characteristics. Primary Insomnia, for instance, is a struggle with adequate or maintained sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is difficulty staying awake for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. Meanwhile, Parasomnias, like Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder, are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/or physiological occurrences. Sleep disorders related to another mental disorder deal with sleep difficulties caused by Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). Our review focuses mainly on insomnia and primary sleep disorders in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, inherited factors, and the physiological aspects of these disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, are crucial for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice found specific GABAB receptors on orexin neurons that regulate sleep and wake states. Activating the GABAA receptor, which is inhibited by baclofen, can increase sleep time. This suggests that animal models like mice can be generalized to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for GABAB receptors in humans. If these receptors are impaired, adequate sleep without medication could be affected. The sociocultural implication is that inherited phenotypes could naturally regulate sleep, and alterations in these receptors could disturb sleep, negatively impacting daily life, including school, career, and monotonous tasks.",
            "This article takes a look at three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, it provides a brief definition of the condition, describing it as a problem with the efficiency and effectiveness of how the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. In simpler terms, it’s a disorder where the brain struggles to properly process sounds we hear, even though the ears are functioning normally. People with CAPD can hear just fine, but the part of the brain responsible for separating words and filtering out background noise doesn't work as it should.\n\nThe origins of CAPD can be traced back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as “auditory imperception”. Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari started developing tests for children with communication disorders in 1954. Kimura then introduced dichotic testing in 1961, which helped understand how the brain processes auditory information. A national conference in 1977 further sparked research on CAPD.\n\nThe disorder can manifest in various ways. A person with CAPD might have trouble pinpointing where sounds are coming from, distinguishing between different sounds, recognizing patterns, or detecting changes in speech. They may also struggle with sounds being blocked by subsequent ones, or have difficulty interpreting sounds to act upon them. Additionally, they might have trouble understanding the sequence of sounds presented to them.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a systematic observation of a patient’s listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. This can be done by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, or others using various measures. There’s no single, consistent tool for diagnosis, and the cause of CAPD is unknown. Tests often present multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and ask the patient to differentiate items like words or numbers. More advanced tests record acoustic signals in the ear and measure responses to them.\n\nLastly, the article concludes with ways a teacher in a mainstream classroom can assist a student with CAPD.",
            "So, Twelfth Night seems to suggest that while disguise can be handy for pulling off long deceits, at some point, you gotta drop it and return to your true self, or else you might lose yourself forever. The tricky part? When you reveal your true colors, you might find yourself all alone. Some folks won't mind being deceived, but others might take it hard. Like, really hard. At the end of the day, you gotta choose between staying true to yourself or keeping your relationships intact. Now, gender role reversal and deception is a whole different ball game. Why would someone feel the need to ditch their own identity and pretend to be someone else? In Viola's case, it's all about self-preservation. “I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) New in town and scared, Viola pretends to be a man to stay safe. Her plan works, but it cuts her off from the women in her life, leaving her isolated. To make things worse, she's so convincing that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) Plus, she's dealing with Orsino's unrequited feelings: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261) Now, this might all seem progressive, but to us modern folk, it might be seen as a way to surface hidden emotions, especially for Olivia and Orsino. It's like Shakespeare is saying, hey, maybe they've got feelings they're not aware of yet. Take Olivia, for instance. Is she into Cesario because he's a man or does she secretly fancy women? Probably not, since Olivia seems more like a product of her time, judging people only by their looks. Case in point, she easily switches her affections from Cesario to Sebastian, treating Cesario/Viola as family instead. “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "So let's delve into the intricacies of German colonial rule. Now, I'm not saying it was all one thing. We're talking about an empire here, and empires are complex beasts. The German colonial empire was a patchwork of policies and governance, as varied as it was vast. But when it comes to education, it was a mixed bag too. In colonies like German East Africa (now Tanzania), the Brits found a literate and educated population. And in Kamerun and other colonies, the Germans got some kudos for their educational efforts. But South West Africa (modern-day Namibia) was a different story. Unlike East Africa, where the government took the reins in educating the locals, in South West Africa, it was largely left to missionary societies with meager government support. Meanwhile, the government invested heavily in European education. This had lingering effects long after German rule ended, with a vast majority of the population remaining uneducated. Social, political, and economic factors were the drivers behind this disparity. This is what I want to explore further, looking at new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere's a ton of literature out there on education in the German colonial empire. Most of it's in German and came out in the early 20th century, either during or soon after the colonial period. Early works were all about describing the educational systems in each colony. Later works in English gave us more detailed comparisons and analyses. These studies highlighted the significant differences between the educational systems. Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa is a standout here. Cohen compares the two colonies and discusses the factors behind their educational differences. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa played a big role in shaping its educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa was moderately temperate, but much of it was arid desert. This attracted a European population—nearly 15,000 whites by 1913. In comparison, East Africa had only 5,336 settlers.",
            "The classification of popular music has evolved significantly over the past 100 years, leading us to a point where listing all the genres and sub-genres can be quite challenging. Genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, for example, have birthed numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, making it even harder to keep track. One such genre that stands out for its diversity and expressiveness is Heavy Metal rock, which has developed into a highly versatile genre over the past 40 years. It’s expressive because it covers a wide range of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker side. Its diversity is evident in the early realization that it offered ample flexibility for experimentation, leading to the creation of various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres that continue to flourish today.\n\nWe’ve reached a point where the Heavy Metal movement has spawned so many unique groups that it's almost impossible to define what Heavy Metal is. It has absorbed themes from other genres, but it has a distinct origin. To understand the metal music of today, one must first grasp what the metal movement is and why it’s considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nHeavy Metal is fundamentally a dark movement. It’s often described as a “music of more”—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. Musicians in metal bands are highly skilled, which is evident in their music. It’s also a movement deeply influenced by drug culture. The mid-70s saw a psychedelic drug boom that led to the creation of crazier, otherworldly music, often using drugs as an excuse for its unique sound. The genre possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which was a new trend at the time, as much of popular music earlier didn’t delve into the darker emotions. Later generations of metal musicians have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like the following showcase the darker side of the movement:\n\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter exhibit the darker side of the Beatles. The song is seen as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, responding to a Rolling Stone song that was also on the heavier, darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove their ability to be as heavy as the Stones, leading to the inclusion of Helter Skelter on their White Album.",
            "So a few decades before the Surrealists started painting their dreamlike masterpieces, there was Henri Rousseau, a man who was figuratively and literally crafting his own dreams. The Dream, a painting from 1910, isn't just a depiction of a woman in awe of a dream landscape; it's a reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. From the start, he dreamt of recognition, acceptance, and praise, but faced a tough internal struggle. Should he conform to existing styles to be accepted or stay true to his unique voice? The Dream captures this lifelong battle: his desire to be part of the art world versus his wish to carve his own path.\n\nTo understand The Dream, we need to know a bit about Rousseau's life. Born in Laval, France, on May 21, 1844, he was a tinsmith's son who never received formal art training. He worked as a gabelou until he was forty, earning the nickname \"douanier\" despite not being a customs inspector. After losing his first wife and many of their children, he turned to painting for solace. Unlike his peers, Rousseau was a folk painter with the hopes and dreams of the common people.\n\nRousseau's quest for acceptance is understandable given his circumstances. Uneducated and starting late, he was painting amidst more famous artists, and his recognition came around the same time as Matisse's rise. Jan Gordon, in Modern French Painters, notes that while they were rivals, they had different motivations. Matisse wanted to avoid clichés, while Rousseau wanted to create something so conventional he’d be accepted.",
            "So many great minds have posited a deep bond between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there's a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats wrote in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— / That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience. Yet, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being formally taught. Both are efforts to describe, rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty often aim to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than setting rules for good art or moral behavior. For instance, discussing da Vinci's Mona Lisa may focus on elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these don't fully capture why it's good art. When asked about a favorite piece, people often say, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more complex explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be fully reduced to their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor put it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Ethics shares this property. As Wittgenstein said, \"Ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this elusive \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and it's this transcendental nature that connects them. I believe morality and art are so closely related because we experience them most powerfully at a noumenal level, as Kant would say. They affect us at a level we can feel but can't fully explain. This link is especially strong with literature. As McKean notes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany, as it stands today, is recognized as a potent force, a united nation with a rich culture that stretches from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic shores of Kiel. This culture is tangible in cities like Cologne, in the heart of Germany, and in Dresden, a Saxon city nestled along the Elbe. Given this diverse cultural tapestry, it's not surprising that Germany, as we know it, has its roots in various sources and tribes.\n\nThe land of the Germans, known as Germania, has a contentious origin story. Some scholars believe the name came from the Germanic tribe called Tungrians, as documented by Tacitus in 98 AD, while others suggest it might come from the Old Irish word meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans were loud or noisy. Regardless, the Romans, who first used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish conquered Gauls from unconquered Germanic tribes, would have been surprised to see the Germanic tribes living on the borders of their empire. Initially, the Romans interacted with the Germanic tribes through trade and the occasional military campaign, but mostly returned to their sprawling empire. The Germanic tribes, however, remained, and their influence continued to shape the lands they inhabited.",
            "Staring down, I blankly took in the sight before me. My mind was unemotionally processing the view, silently analyzing it with a practiced precision that refused to relate the object to any abstract understanding. Thoughts flitted in and out of my consciousness almost too quickly to notice. It was as if I was experiencing the scene rather than thinking about it.\nYears ago, an artist I worked with recommended an art instruction book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had always wanted to learn how to draw, and this book promised to teach even the basics of understanding a pencil and how the brain interprets lines. One technique it taught was to place a square frame around any picture to simplify a complex scene. Standing there, I couldn't mentally project that frame onto the bowl of fruit in front of me. I was too overwhelmed, too awed by the prospect of painting. If I had any pretensions to being artistic, this was my first canvas, my first story: \"Work in Brown.\"\nFingertips resting on the brush handle, muscles tensing and relaxing as I moved my hand through space, I was about to capture a moment of creativity. Water circled, clear and calm, crystal clear and clean. Matter broke away and was swept away. My hand hit the handle again, muscles tightening more this time, a little more anxious. The brown package refused to budge. It was stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.\nMop in hand, feet spread apart, tie knotted tightly around my throat, I frowned at the offensive bundle of food waste left for the bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more quiet moments, then my hand reached for the wall, the end of the toilet paper. I wrapped it around my hand until it looked like an oven mitt. Standing up straight, I bent down, my hand slowly entering the bowl, like a mother reaching into the oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "Another tragic trend that's been making headlines lately is the alarming number of teenagers dying behind the wheel. Several factors are at play here, and it's a deadly combination. The National Institutes of Health point out that the teen brain isn't fully mature for driving yet, and this immaturity, combined with sheer inexperience, leads to more fatal crashes, vehicle rollovers, speeding tickets, and off-road incidents. Add to that the fact that teens often drive with friends, which is something anyone with a speck of wisdom knows they do frequently. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found that the number of traffic accidents increases with the age of the passengers in the car.\n\nTo tackle this issue, some states have introduced temporary provisional licenses that restrict teens to drive only during certain hours and ban other minors as passengers. However, these measures are just temporary fixes. The real problem is that, as a group, young drivers just aren't ready to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes that even 18 is too young for a full driver's license. He's found that teens under 19 or 20 often crave excitement and take risks for the thrill of it, and it makes sense to delay driving until these tendencies mellow out. If we keep issuing driver's licenses to young teens, we're looking at more deadly crashes and a potential surge in teen deaths in just a few years. By 2010, the Baby Boomers' children will be eligible to drive, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads.\n\nAddressing this issue through legislation could be relatively simple. Schools could start teaching future drivers, but no one under 18 could actually drive a car. Provisional permits could still be issued, and teens would need to complete a certain number of hours of driving practice with an adult, similar to the requirements in most states. The specific number could be based on the current standards (6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult in California, for example). As the statistics show, teen driving fatalities are a concern across all states, making a uniform national policy a reasonable and effective solution.\n\nThis proposed legislation isn't a groundbreaking idea, but it could make a significant difference in the safety of our young drivers.",
            "So I decided to take a gander at the Library of Congress's collection of Edison's old films, specifically the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films were basically all about creative editing to create illusions. My film study focused on describing the poetic elements of most trick films and examining the unique characteristics of a few of the later ones. The trick films of the time were pretty much confined to a set, framed within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, long and medium shots, and sticking to the one shot, one film rule.\n\nBut some of these films at the beginning of the twentieth century were bold enough to break these rules by introducing aspects like multiple shots. One thing that stood out in these trick films was their filming style. They were shot in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera didn't move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects, drawing from the theatre and vaudeville tradition. Figures in trick films generally only moved side-to-side, not towards or away from the camera. For instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right and moved back and forth along the horizontal axis, without the camera following them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium setup also meant that shots were typically long shots or, less often, medium shots. Close-ups were never used in any of the Edison trick films. This again was borrowed from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. Since actors didn't move towards the camera, close-ups were non-existent.\n\nMost of these early trick films followed the pattern of one conceptual shot equaling a film. This usually kept the films short, about a minute or less, and limited their dramatic or narrative use. They mainly focused on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing, and switching acts, with little story. However, what appeared to be one conceptual shot to the viewer actually wasn't necessarily one physical shot. A single \"shot\" could be made up of several joined together to create illusions like apparition or disappearing. Take The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) as an example. A closer look reveals that the physical shot with Mary's \"head\" starts, even though the film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate supporter of the Republican cause. Despite being primarily a farmer, his time in politics and his commitment to his profession instilled in him a deep dedication to personal liberty and the principles of government. His devotion to an agrarian lifestyle shaped nearly all of his views on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed the United States had a unique opportunity to establish a perfect system because no native traditions hindered its founding, allowing for a government of self-governance. He held firm beliefs in the interdependence of natural rights and the need for them to be beyond government control. He argued that those with physical strength and cunning took advantage in a state of nature, but in civilization, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must account for human nature’s inherent good and evil. He was rigid in his dualistic morality, stating, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He considered principles that protected private property, improved agriculture, and discouraged capitalism as good, and believed a government founded on these principles would function fairly despite its corruptible administration.\n\nTaylor, like many of his contemporaries, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a minimal Federal government, only granting it powers explicitly stated in the Constitution. He acknowledged that an expansive Federal government could become tyrannical due to its cost, but he also cautioned that a simple, literal interpretation could lead to corruption without considering the founders' intent. The Declaration of Independence, he believed, was the true charter of the United States, as it explicitly described the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at Figure 17, we noticed a significant drop in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project. This was quite disheartening, and it's tough to pinpoint the exact cause. With winter setting in at the New England campus, commuting by bicycle or on foot naturally declined. December also marks the end of the fall semester, a time when everyone is busy with schoolwork and grading. Filling out the commuter log might have gotten lost in the shuffle. Plus, December brings the holiday season, often resulting in a month-long break for students and faculty, during which many don't need to come to campus. Classes resume in late January for the spring semester, which might have contributed to the low log submissions for that month. However, February's low submissions remain unexplained. The project might just have experienced an initial burst of energy that naturally faded. To boost engagement, we organized the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which did indeed increase log submissions. This highlights the challenge of maintaining project momentum during natural engagement dips and holiday/semester breaks. Another hurdle for this project, or any similar initiative, is the deeply ingrained culture of driving personal cars for commuting. To encourage alternative commuting, we offered gift certificates to local businesses like restaurants, coffee shops, a bookstore, and even national chains. It would have been interesting to see the impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars. If we had gradually increased the prize value over time, it might have boosted participation and engagement. The gift cards were effective at the start, but announcing larger prizes in December and January could have sustained and possibly even increased participation.",
            "Another financial tool to consider is an ETF, or exchange-traded fund. Unlike index funds, ETFs offer more flexibility and trade like individual stocks on an exchange. They bring the diversification of an index fund and the perks of owning a single stock, such as the ability to short sell, buy on margin, and purchase as few as one share. The advantages are clear, but so are some drawbacks. Like stocks, ETFs charge commissions on trades, and while their expense ratios are lower than mutual funds, they can still add up.\n\nA savvy investor should assess whether the benefits of owning an ETF, like diversification, truly exist and to what extent. For this effort, let's examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. The top 10 holdings are listed below along with their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge how well these top 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, let's calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, normalized to 100%. The results of these calculations are shown in the chart below.\n\nThe chart shows that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase. Additionally, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. Initially, it seems a portfolio of the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower Beta. However, the statistical significance of these portfolios may not be different.\n\nTo determine if the portfolios are statistically different, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Another one of Edgar Allan Poe's notable works is \"Dream-Land,\" which he himself considered one of his better poems. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which, according to Mabbott, traces back to Virgil's writings. Virgil used this term to refer to an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world by the Greeks. While it is certain that Virgil did use the term, there is a more contemporary source to which credit may also be given. Poe had a keen interest in German authors, especially the works of Goethe.\n\nThis is significant because it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" discusses the similarities between Poe's and Goethe's poems, concluding that Poe was likely influenced by Goethe's work.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a celebrated writer, particularly known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second in the year of his death, 1832. Within the second part of Faust, there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem tells the story of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet as a gift. After her death, the king becomes consumed with drinking and grief, ultimately deciding to end his life. He gives away all his possessions to his children, except for the goblet, which he throws into the sea before deleting himself from the cliff. The descriptions of the King of Thule and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, suggesting a dark reflection of Poe's own experiences and struggles with substance abuse.\n\nPoe references Thule twice in his collected works. He uses the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but he also employs the term \"Thule\" as bookends for \"Dream-Land.\" \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be read as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule, which is dark, lonely, and haunted by the memory of dead friends. The lack of color in the world mirrors the gloom of the King of Thule's situation after the loss of his wife. The entire poem is as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a significant author whose work Poe would have known, if for no other reason than his admiration for Tennyson. When asked if he admired Tennyson, Poe expressed that, aside from their connection, he would have been exposed to Goethe's work through numerous reproductions of his original publications.",
            "In the case of Jennifer Palmer suing D&D Markets, California law may allow her to seek punitive damages if she can prove the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with malicious intent. Palmer needs to show that Martin was aware of the potential harm from the applesauce spill and deliberately disregarded it. Martin was informed about the spill twice, but he failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner. This could be considered malicious if he knew the previous incidents involving slip-and-fall injuries and chose not to act. Palmer's claim that Martin's actions were despicable is weaker but still reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009.",
            "CBC was the place where I first delved into the teachings of Islam, four years ago now. The heated debates sparked in class about whether or not Islam is inherently hostile were as relevant then as they are today, perhaps even more so. Since 9/11, I've witnessed the media's view of Islam shifting from outright hostility towards extremists to an almost extreme tolerance. I doubt that, back in 2001, an American presidential candidate with an obvious Muslim background like Barack Obama could have been a possibility.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography has always intrigued me, as it seems to present a stark contrast to the historical accounts I've read. According to the biography, Muhammad is portrayed as a martyr and a humble figure who, rather than forcibly converting others, saw people come to him seeking the truth in his teachings. This depiction, however, doesn't align with the historical narrative of Muhammad's rise to power. It's as if the biography is trying to elevate Muhammad to a godly figure, portraying him as wise, gentle, and humble. Yet, history contradicts this, and I can't help but wonder if modern Muslims are aware of the true historical context surrounding Muhammad's rise.\n\nMoreover, there are uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad that intrigue me. For instance, the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men bears a striking resemblance to Jesus' miracle of feeding the five thousand. This style of writing, I believe, is an attempt to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who, through his actions and teachings, demonstrates the truth without needing to prove anything. This approach, however, diminishes the life and miracles of Jesus, making it seem like they are borrowing credit from his life.\n\nThe biography also includes numerous stories that aim to provide 'witnesses' to the conversion of people to Islam. However, many of these tales are told from a third-party perspective, such as the author hearing the story from someone who heard it from another person. I found this approach to be less convincing, as it often diminishes the stories' credibility by adding layers of uncertainty. It's as if the authors were trying to build a case for the truth of the stories, but the third-party nature of many of them makes it seem more like a string of hearsay.\n\nWhat troubles me the most about this work is the attempt to portray Muhammad as a godly, humble, and wise figure. This portrayal contradicts historical accounts of Muhammad's rise to power and makes me question whether modern Muslims are aware of the historical context surrounding his life.",
            "So, the teachings of Jesus, the beliefs he held during his lifetime, were quickly left behind as Christianity evolved after his passing. Looking at this from a broad perspective, it's clear that Christianity has drifted further and further from its origins over time. Today, we see a growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive trend. While traditional people persist and may resist any new thinking, they might not be enough to influence the entire population. Among believers, a historical awareness will undoubtedly grow in future years. There will be a longing to distinguish the doctrines added to Christianity over time from what Jesus originally intended. It may take decades or even centuries, but the end result will be inevitable: a return to the religion's original form. A movement will emerge, growing in numbers, and will peel away layers of doctrine, one by one, like a clock winding backward. When this trend reaches the United States and Europe, it will influence many to worship as if they were living during Jesus' time, following only his ideas. The church, as an institution, will remain strong to guide this path. However, as the theological clock reverses, the extreme diversity within Christendom will reduce to greater uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions, we'll see increasing similarities instead of differences. Human history is filled with such reversals. For example, Christians were once persecuted and killed by the Roman Empire, but the empire later became a Christian institution. Our country has transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversal coming in the future will play out in the realm of Christianity, undoing history and diversity in the process. A key part of what will enable this process is interpreting Jesus' words as metaphorical, rather than literal statements. So, what has happened since Jesus' lifetime?\n       If we delve deep into history, we find that Judaism was the theological foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, the belief in a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were at the core of the religion by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not unified in spirit, dividing into groups like Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots, along with a majority of common people.",
            "I believe that \"The Jungle\" illustrates how, deep down, humans are inherently selfish and focused solely on their own prosperity. They strive to make their lives as comfortable and successful as possible, without considering the well-being of those less fortunate. This is evident in the owners and managers of the massive factories, who are solely driven by the desire to expand their enterprises, often at the expense of others. They disregard any collateral damage caused by their relentless pursuit of growth. Upton Sinclair vividly portrays this with his description, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery highlights the environmental devastation and the callous disregard for all life forms affected by the factories. The owners and managers also prioritize profits over their employees' welfare, subjecting them to grueling work conditions without any concern for their well-being or safety. They exploit their workers, often firing them without notice or compensation, as there were few regulations or protections for labor in that era. Sinclair's portrayal of the workers as \"slaves\" underscores the inhuman treatment they endured, with no recourse or support systems in place. Even when unions were formed, they often worsened the situation by exploiting the workers themselves. The unchecked power of the owners and managers, combined with the desperation of the workers, resulted in a system that was as oppressive and exploitative as chattel slavery.",
            "Many authors employ various methods to evoke specific feelings or attitudes towards significant topics. Some techniques work better than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes many of these methods in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" One approach he often uses is combining an adjective and a noun that don't typically go together to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. Another technique is investing meaning in symbols and using them repeatedly for the same purpose. Fitzgerald employs the latter technique with several colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel, Fitzgerald assigns meanings to colors like white/gray and red/pink, and later uses these meanings to reinforce a particular feeling around important objects.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald assigns to white/gray is uniformity, with white representing a higher, more refined status, and gray signifying age and decay. He establishes this meaning early in the novel by frequently using both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as “in white” (8), and even Nick wears “white flannels” (41) at Gatsby’s party. Tom is in a “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). The only time people aren’t wearing white is when Nick observes Gatsby’s party: “the halls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald also uses these colors to depict common, unimportant subjects: as Nick heads to work, he descends “the white chasms of lower New York” (56), and the names of people at Gatsby’s parties become “gray names” (61) on his schedule. Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses” (28), and plain or common people and places are described as white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a “white girlhood” (19), there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\n\nAfter imbuing these colors with meaning, Fitzgerald uses them to symbolize unimportance or uniformity in subjects. This technique begins with Daisy. After a long period with little significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster” (74); readers start to perceive Daisy as less of a character and more like a uniform, something that Gatsby desires and yearns for. Fitzgerald employs this method often to emphasize Daisy’s uniformity, such as with a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18) and her wearing “white” (115) before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",
            "Another thing I've been doing is researching the land around San Diego. It's got a great climate for farming, so it's no surprise that it's super productive. You can find all sorts of stuff there like tomatoes, citrus fruits, and all sorts of greens. There's a big market for organic produce too, with many local supporters lined up. Plus, they do tours and let you enjoy the outdoors. Sounds like a sweet deal, right? But it's not all sunshine and roses. Organic farming can be pricey because you've got to put in extra work to keep things pest-free and healthy without using chemicals. And the land I found on a real estate website? It's a big piece of chaparral, grassland, and oak forest next to a national forest. It's home to some rare critters, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat and the mountain yellow-legged frog. There's a conservation plan for the area that's still being worked on, but it's got over a hundred species on the list. The land has a history too - it was used by Native Americans and later by cattle ranchers. I'm looking into government programs to see if I can get some help to make the farm more profitable and wildlife-friendly.",
            "Culture plays a significant part in any negotiation. Culture is more about what it isn't than what it is, and its significance can vary greatly. It's not one-size-fits-all, and generalizations like “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating” are too broad and oversimplified. While understanding general cultural traits is helpful, it's more important to grasp how a culture's attitudes and values impact negotiations and how to adapt to them. When encountering a foreign culture, one tends to relate it to their own, making comparisons inevitable. Understanding a foreign culture or mindset can involve delving into its history and recognizing its prejudices. Instead of judging or trying to change a culture, one should simply accept it and work within its parameters, especially if you're at a weaker bargaining position. If you're in a \"foreign\" environment, respecting local traditions and beliefs can help overcome cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt's also crucial to note that culture isn't just about national or international differences. Within a single nation, many companies have their own corporate cultures. These can vary widely, with some emphasizing long hours, while others foster a more relaxed work schedule. You can see these differences in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Some companies encourage employee philanthropy at any level, while others limit it to \"company-approved\" causes. Even within the U.S., corporate cultures can vary greatly, from region to region and from urban to suburban environments. Some cultures may appear more uniform to outsiders, but it's essential to look deeper.\n\nValues are particularly important to understand because they explain why a culture is the way it is. If saving face or communal harmony is valued in a culture, a negotiator won't publicly shame their company or superiors to succeed. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes a hard-driven bargain won't rush to settle. It's crucial to consider these generalizations before sitting down at the table, but also to learn something about your opponent's personal background to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, \"There is no God.\" This quote, found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, is the starting point for St. Anselm's argument about the existence of God. Interestingly, this sentiment is shared by another author we'll discuss, Thomas Aquinas. Both of their arguments aim to prove the existence of the same concept of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To simplify, we must assume they both believe in this God. However, neither truly provides a complete basis for belief in God.\n\nLet's first look at St. Anselm's argument. He suggests that understanding God comes from within our own hearts. He argues that since God exists within our understanding, we cannot conceive of his non-existence. This concept, although worded convolutedly, basically means that proof for God lies within our own minds. We don't need to search beyond our inner selves for evidence; the truth about God is found by exploring what we inherently know. This idea is often called faith within Christian literature.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas believes that God's existence can be proven through logic and empirical evidence, without relying on faith. Such a stance is advantageous for converting new believers, as it allows for recruitment without needing people to accept unprovable concepts. Aquinas presents five logical arguments to support this claim: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He shows that the proof of God's existence lies in the logical necessity for him. If you know you're missing a puzzle piece, you can deduce the features and existence of the missing piece without seeing it.",
            "Sometime around the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned the world and attained enlightenment, leading to the birth of Buddhism—with the most traditional sect being Theravada Buddhism. The religion is nearly twenty-five hundred years old, and it has evolved significantly from its original form. This can be seen in Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. Monks and laypeople alike take part, despite Buddha never having taught about such a ritual. These changes range from superficial traditions to the religion's core beliefs. Both monastic and lay Theravada Buddhists have had to adjust their doctrinal principles over time, due to both internal and external influences, both friendly and hostile.\n\nThis discussion will use several key terms. Internal forces are those that originate from within the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. External forces are those from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, born of a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces are those that don't intend to harm or help, but may do so as a side effect. These terms will be used frequently in this discussion.\n\nTo understand the religion, we must first explore its core doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is made up of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka includes all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka sets out rules for life, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka deals with the religion's metaphysical components. These include concepts like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering, and Anicca—impermanence. Only by accepting these ideas can one escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and overcome lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion. The Vinaya Pitaka contains rules for life, such as the five precepts for laypeople and many more for monks. The most fundamental principle of Buddhism is the four noble truths. First, life is suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico once shared a long-standing rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145) describe this rivalry, with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 being its peak. During this conflict, the United States attacked and won, gaining Texas and the American Southwest. The rivalry was fueled by differences in religion, culture, and tradition, as well as a clash of material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). This isn't uncommon among neighboring nations. David M. Pletcher (1977) notes, “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41). Mexico and Cuba, being geographically close to the United States, have historically been rivals, unlike other Latin American nations that have maintained good relations with the United States. Religious differences, similar to the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, played a significant role in this rivalry. Sally Frahm (2001) states, “If in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy” (p. 86). The distrust between the English and Spanish, a legacy from colonial times, further strained relations. Diehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes during this 57-year period, most of which were territorial issues involving border raids and frontier problems. Schmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry's decline began when Mexico became more dependent on the United States, and it ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly struck down by an illness that I had never known existed.\n\nAt the time, I was a nurse. I had chosen this profession due to a deep-seated need for the safety and security that I had lacked as a child. \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick,\" was the mantra I heard repeatedly as I grew older. Thus, even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist, perhaps a mix of both, I chose nursing.\n\nNow, here I am, 46 years old, single, and without much money in the bank, unable to work. I am still disabled, and after 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I have virtually nothing left that I can call my own. I manage to get by, but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, yet, there is one thing I know for certain. I could not have made it through all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. And let me tell you, when real disaster strikes, you do not feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life, big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well one prepares, some things are just too big to overcome on your own.\n\nI concur wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's \"basket\"; Lord knows it is moldy and falling apart, anyway. Yet, I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again—learning to help each other and to ask for help, rather than having each of us individually scrambling out to the backyard to build fallout shelters.\n\nThe Conservatives in the U.S. talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country; but in truth, what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism; it was compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and an array of batteries, candles, and waterproof matches, as well as canned goods. If you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food—do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, provided you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you are at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "Alright, so, why do organisms evolve the way they do? Are there certain rules or limits that guide the path of evolutionary change? Well, back in 1917, D’Arcy Thompson said that even then, scientists were barely scratching the surface of defining organic forms mathematically. Fast forward to today, and we're using math to understand mollusks' skeleton growth over time through both individual development and across generations. Our research is all about blending mathematical modeling with experiments to figure out how growth and size changes happen. We used X-ray images of Prunum species to spot key measurements and entered them into a software called CerioShell. By creating hypothetical shell shapes, we're exploring the limits of possible changes in Prunum. And we're combining this with experiments and descriptions to better grasp the big picture of evolution in this group.\n\nImagine a shell as a tube that wraps around a central axis called the columella, spinning in 360-degree loops called whorls. The speed at which these whorls grow varies, and a continuous line separates each one, known as a suture. The biggest whorl is usually the last one, called the body whorl, and the rest are part of the spire. The shell's tip is called the apex, and the other end is the base. The animal exits through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be seen from different angles: apical, basal, apertural, or abapertural. The most common way to view a shell is apertural, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, start by looking at the shell from the apical view, find the first suture, and draw a line through it. Count whorls from there, estimating to a quarter of a whorl as needed.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a series of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. You can trace this path using the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture. This trajectory can be shown both graphically and mathematically. Once you have a mathematical formula, you can tweak parameters to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "So, another decade has rolled by, and it seems life in Indonesia, at least when it comes to neonatal and infant mortality, has been rather stagnant. The nation's progress in meeting the Millennium Development Goals is noteworthy, with marked improvements in water and sanitation. However, the pace of progress in reducing child and maternal health issues is far from where it needs to be by 2015. Let's delve into the reasons behind these shortcomings and why we should focus on strengthening the overall health system rather than just tweaking specific programs.\n\nA positive sign is that 72% of births now see a skilled health worker, but this includes traditional workers like midwives who can't handle complications. This improvement is misleading, as there's still much work to be done. Additionally, the treatment of diarrheal cases in children under five has decreased, and postnatal care is an area of concern with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarian-section rates are still dismally low at 4%, with urban areas at 7% and rural areas at just 2%, indicating a severe equity gap in healthcare access. This disparity is further exacerbated by a 27% gap in service utilization between the richest and poorest quintiles, suggesting that the poor struggle to access healthcare services likely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care, the most crucial question is how to best address the lack of service. Should Indonesia focus on program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system? Programmatic approaches are appealing due to their targeted, manageable nature and faster results. However, investing heavily in one area may starve other sectors of funding and resources, leading to a duplication of uncoordinated services and an increase in administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels diverge from the norm by incorporating elements of mystery and the bizarre, which serve to enrich the characters and provide deeper insights into their motivations and emotions. Both works employ dream sequences or dreamlike states to convey this sense of mystery, though the specifics vary in each case.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often unveil Oliver's inner turmoil, revealing what troubles him and his awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event vividly, as if in a dream, while struggling to find help. This passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events and his dire physical condition, as reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself leaves Oliver overwhelmed, his senses numbed as he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" that bears him away; he experiences his despair anew, removed from the initial shock of pain, as the pain becomes constant and linked with fear rather than surprise. The question arises as to whose will brought about his misfortune, as it certainly wasn't his own. This shooting underscores Oliver's limited control over his circumstances, even as his life is in danger. Furthermore, it suggests a growing sense of defeat, as if Fagin has begun to break him, compelling him to accept this despair and influencing his ability to react. It can be assumed that if Oliver were not resigned to this despair, he would have made at least a minimal effort to save himself.\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as it came – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "Back in the day, I worked as a tutor for an after-school program, helping elementary kids with their homework. While I excelled in English and reading, I was recruited to assist a kid named Adrian, who was having a rough time with reading. Initially, it seemed like he had peculiar reading problems, but it turned out his issue was that he could read, but he didn't know the English alphabet well. I finally realized this when his mom walked in, speaking only Spanish. With my fledgling Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. That day, I understood Adrian's struggle, and I hope he's doing better now. I share this story to highlight the language barrier in schools, particularly in California. It's not always as evident as we think, and even kids who speak perfect English can struggle with reading due to alphabet and pronunciation issues. The solution isn't simple; it requires a combination of approaches, like dual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes. For Adrian, tutoring in English reading and pronunciation was effective, but for kids who barely speak English, the solution is more complex. The key is combining all these methods to address the language barrier effectively.",
            "From childhood, many of us are taught that something larger than ourselves exists, something we can't comprehend. Some of us learn about it through Sunday school or religious institutions, while others look within themselves or reject it altogether, embracing our own egocentric universe. Each of us defines our spirituality through our unique perspectives, searching for light in the darkness to guide us. When my father passed away, he was, in many ways, already gone. I chose not to witness his departure, preferring to remember him through his life rather than his death. I couldn't let the knowledge of his passing make it more real for both of us, so I curled up in a ball in my bed, waiting for the news. No one called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel,\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, is essentially an \"old-new\" oxymoron. The Gothic mode has been both criticized and celebrated, accused of lacking depth, and praised for its 'terrible sublime' quality (Burke). The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, merged ideas from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre and a new literary approach. Walpole combined old theatrical elements and modern mimicry of nature in his 'modern' novels, presenting what he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre often incorporates throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to modern societal and literary advancements. The blend of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" style and the new novel format, which allowed readers a more personal view of character psychology, kept Gothic relevant for a long time, making it both obsolete and new to readers far removed from the original time.\n\nOne of the key themes in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, or the training of a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it represents the classic knight—brave, honorable, competent—and the perceived lack of that ideal in their contemporary society. Through chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, hinting at the genre's evolution towards Romanticism, and used to try and improve the present. Walpole, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, was living in a politically tumultuous era and grappling with the possibility of a troubled future. Immersed in politics and unfair accusations, he may have begun to believe, if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" of people in the Gothic era had been lost in the individuals making up the 'present' society. This sentiment is evident in several characters, one being Frederic. The reader learns about Frederic before meeting him, and he embodies many chivalric traits: he is a prince, has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently thought to be killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is exaggerated, bringing into play the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain management involves the chain of events that moves goods from an initial customer order through to the stage of raw materials, production, distribution, and final delivery to the customer. The term \"supply chain management\" was coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant, who described it as the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what happens in the supply chain to meet customers' needs efficiently. This process revolves around six key elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers utilize these elements to ensure optimal customer service.\n\nThe first crucial step in the supply chain is production. Production is foundational to the entire process. Managers must understand what customers want, which can be gauged by studying the market. The market's demands influence what products should be produced and in what quantities. Once the market study is complete, managers determine where and which plant would be best for production, considering volume and quality requirements. The next step is scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Each detail in production is vital, and any oversight can result in significant time and money losses. For instance, I previously worked at Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business had a designated process, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks. These outlined processes ensure smooth operations and clarity in expectations.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply, which involves strategic decisions to shape the core capabilities of a facility and form partnerships for outsourcing. A company may have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with unique equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division best fits the product's processes. Outsourcing can also be a strategy to create velocity, which is the ability to offer high-quality and flexible services while minimizing costs.",
            "The sign reads: \"Hitler lives on in Burma.\" Ellen Page, the actor from the movie Juno, stands alone on a city street with a cardboard sign held high, the chilling message written in Sharpie. Burma, or Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a brutal military junta that seized control in 1962 following a coup d'état. In 2007, a series of public protests known as \"The Saffron Revolution\" erupted, sparked by monks. Initially, the government tolerated these peaceful gatherings, but the violence soon escalated as the military attacked monasteries nation-wide. Foreign journalists were arrested, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed during a protest on September 27th, 2007. The official death toll stands at 13, but a defected colonel claims many more were killed, numbering potentially in the thousands.\n\nThis isn't a new trend. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control over their citizens. Early Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, Japanese emperors were considered gods, and even our current president, George W. Bush, allegedly holds weekly meetings with Ted Haggard of Stupid People Worldwide, a branch of the Republican Party.\n\nNotable examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protest, where intellectuals, workers, and students gathered to challenge the government's authoritarian rule, with death tolls ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s involved Hutu militias and the government systematically killing Tutsis and political moderates, regardless of ethnicity. Hitler's \"Third Reich\" was a period of systematic persecution and murder of individuals of Jewish background across multiple countries.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz is greatly due to his longevity and the creative prowess he brought to his orchestra. Often seen as a subtle pianist in many of his compositions, Ellington excelled in composing rich and complex pieces that highlighted each band member's unique abilities. He established a framework where soloists could freely improvise, writing tightly orchestrated sections that showcased each player's style. This not only emphasized the tone of the orchestra but also created a unique and coherent sound for every piece. Ellington's mastery of individual players' sounds, as well as how they blended together into a cohesive ensemble, resulted in some of jazz's most innovative and brilliant works. The Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's use of voice as a jazz instrument, exemplified in Creole Love Call, where he utilized the voice to add texture and color without lyrics. This piece is notable for its six choruses, each featuring different instrumental sections and soloists, demonstrating Ellington's ability to complement his soloists' styles. In Hot and Bothered and It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington continued to excel at tight orchestration and tone color, using unique combinations of vocal and instrumental elements to create rich, complementary sounds.",
            "She had always felt this gnawing emptiness, a longing that couldn't be satisfied. It began when she was 14, just starting to navigate teenage life, and it persisted at 17. She had come to realize she desired a certain someone rather than some material possession, but no boy had caught her interest. Several had tried to woo her, with varying degrees of clumsiness, but none sparked the spark she craved. She often pondered this peculiar situation, wondering what could be the cause. Years of introspection offered theories, but nothing concrete enough to give her any clarity. So, she continued living her life, perpetually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually serene and peaceful. Her parents were calm and harmonious, rarely arguing with each other or her. The only disputes were over her asserting her independence and unique personality. They were fond of her for her lively spirit, which complemented their laid-back nature, making her well-liked and nice.\n\nToday, however, was not a typical peaceful day. As she moved from room to room, searching for inspiration, a sudden shriek from the kitchen pierced the air. She rushed in to find her mother lying on the floor, in obvious pain. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she cried out in panic. Her mother managed to whisper, \"Ouch...sweetie...I...need you to take me to the hospital.\" Her daughter quickly sprang into action, helped her mother into the car, and drove them to the nearest hospital.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the familiar scent of disinfectant and the underlying aroma of sickness. She wasn't focused on that, though; her mind was consumed with worrying about her mother. She rushed her mother to the nearest doctor, who immediately set to work. Her daughter was left to wait, her heart pounding with anxiety.\n\nHer mother had fallen from a ladder while trying to reach a high cabinet. The doctor's assessment was clear: her mother needed critical care.",
            "This research aimed to demonstrate that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed), is linked to reduced chances of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is a tweaked version of the Med diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, while also lowering intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is allowed.\n\nPrevious research found an inverse relationship between following the Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular mortality (CVD), and showed that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in overweight individuals. However, these studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Every six years from 1984 to 2004, the authors calculated an aMed score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). More than 95% of nurses continued participating throughout the 20-year period. FFQs were validated, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Cases without available records were considered \"probable\" and included, with around 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts classified this way. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, with leisure-time physical activity assessed starting in 1986.\n\nTo minimize random variation and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated. Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could confuse results) by considering age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the association between the aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, there were 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "Well, you know what happened in '07, it was a complete financial meltdown. Jobless rates soared, the housing market tanked, and many big shots in business were left in the dust. We've been feeling the effects ever since. I reckon we should ask ourselves, how did it all go south, and how can we avoid it happening again? Now, the crisis was cooked up by politicians who were pushing banks to give out sub-prime loans, even though the financial system wasn't ready. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were also under pressure to back these mortgages and then resell them as CDOs and CDSs. When people started defaulting on these loans, the banks were left high and dry, and it all cascaded into a full-blown economic disaster.\n\nThe seeds of this mess were sown back in '99 during the Clinton era. The President was eyeing a second term, and he wanted to boost his popularity. So, he relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime fiasco just seven years later. Steven Holmes, writing for the New York Times, warned back then, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest mortgage underwriter, was facing increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgages for low and moderate-income people and from stockholders to keep growing profits.” Holmes was right on the mark: ill-advised lending would indeed bring about the economic meltdown.\n\nA lot of things combined to send the economy into a spin. Mortgages were getting more complicated, with adjustable rates, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs becoming common. This only made the housing market more interconnected with the rest of the economy, leaving people and financial markets vulnerable to any little price changes.\n\nAnd then, the housing bubble burst. Banks that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were left with nothing but sour faces. The top five U.S. investment banks reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007—that's about 30% of the USA's GDP. Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch got sold off cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become commercial banks, all under intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were in $5 trillion worth of mortgage debt and were put under government control in September 2008. It was a mess, and it all started with some bad political decisions.",
            "So here we are, exposition time. That's the part where you spread your writer's wings and either captivate or bore your readers. Dr. Merlin, she's known to shout at her monitor when caught in the throes of Too Much Information, and not in the fun kind of way either.\n\nWe all know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still finds herself in the muck of long-winded text where nothing much happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is that little devil on your shoulder telling you to get the history out of the way to get to the good stuff, not to be confused with the devil on the other shoulder who wants you to dump every detail of your characters' pasts onto your audience.\n\nExposition means just telling the audience what happened, typically in straightforward prose. In movies, it's when one character pours out a bunch of info to another, like the Ancient Mariner. In fiction, the author does the pouring.\n\nConsider this: you're reading along and are told the heroine met her love at such a place and time, they were married in a grand fashion, and he was murdered in front of her eyes. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to stretch over two pages, with only a handful of lines of dialogue. You'd expect a bit more than just the bare facts—some insight into how he loved her, how she changed because of him. You'd mourn his death with her, and thus, become more connected to her character.\n\nIn short, you'd expect some meat on the simple bone of the story: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, presses on*) It's tempting to rush past certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he was once in the Air Force, now runs a gas station at night, has been married twice, no kids, loves fishing on weekends, and dreams of owning the station someday, just had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nBut you gotta slow down and provide those details. Show us who he is, not just tell us.",
            "I caught two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, today (August 13, 2011). The first was a \"live\" segment on NBC 4. The lead story was about a guy named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who stabbed his wife – they didn't mention her name. His mug shot was shown, and he had an eerie look about him. They only spent about two minutes on this story, which seemed appropriate given it was still developing.\n\nThe second story was about the shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and there were no arrests or suspects at the time. The SWAT Team was investigating. This story felt short, and I suspect that might be due to the fact that it involved a \"black\" man or a black neighborhood. I've noticed over the years that minorities are often overlooked when they're victims of crimes. If it were a \"white\" child or adult, the media would go crazy, but for a minority, it's lucky if it's even mentioned.\n\nNext up, they discussed a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where the incident might have occurred, and it was determined to be a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a five-thousand-dollar reward for tips leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThen, they talked about rain and thunderstorms expected for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned the temperatures would stay in the mid to low eighties over the weekend. The story was a bit short, but it was used as a teaser to keep us tuned in.\n\nThey also ran a story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man in a hoodie sweatshirt, about six feet tall and 150 pounds. They devoted an unusual amount of time talking about his race and how dark he was, which felt excessive.\n\nFinally, they mentioned a convicted drug kingpin named Rene Rodriguez. He was a Hispanic man from Texas, convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio. Instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years in prison, they said \"300\" months. I'm not sure why they did that, perhaps to make it sound harsher. They also mentioned his Hispanic background, which I don't think was really relevant to the story.",
            "There is an unbreakable bond between brothers, a connection that is as complex as it is profound. This bond carries with it a range of emotions - love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers, more than anyone else, understand each other deeply. They can see themselves reflected in their brother's eyes, seeing not how others perceive them, but their true selves. It's in moments of crisis that this bond truly shines, revealing the good and the bad. When these feelings surface, they come with a hefty price tag. Understanding these emotions, and their consequences, is part of appreciating the weight of this fraternal connection. When a brother looks at you, they see not just you, but your essence. Their actions and the outcomes of those actions unveil their true character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is explored through the journey of two brothers. Through their interactions and the narrator's perspective, the intense emotions that accompany this bond are vividly depicted. The protagonist's feelings are dominated by one emotion: pride. From their first adventure together to their final, tragic outing, the protagonist feels resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He dreams of teaching Doodle all the skills he knows, like holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing Old Woman Swamp vines. He wants a brother to race with to Horsehead Landing and to perch with in the great pine tree. These dreams are shattered when Doodle's weak heart condition is revealed. The protagonist is filled with anger, even considering suffocating Doodle with a pillow. Yet, his heart softens when Doodle smiles at him. This moment of weakness in his conviction shows the love he has, albeit hidden, for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex, innovative information processor. As technology evolved from primitive to contemporary times, so did the analogies used to describe the brain. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and most recently, a computer. As you delve into the brain, remember that these metaphors are limited in their usefulness and can lead to misconceptions. Information processing begins with input from the senses, converting physical sensations such as touch, heat, sound, or light into electrochemical signals. The sensory data is continually transformed by the brain's algorithms, both through bottom-up and top-down processes. For instance, when you see a black box against a white background, bottom-up processing helps determine the object's simple properties like color, orientation, and edges. Top-down processing speeds up recognition by using decisions made from previous steps. This could help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the background. Once data is processed, an attention filter decides its importance and which cognitive processes should access it. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. However, you might pick out your name in a noisy room. Numerous processing stages exist, with results modulated by attention repeatedly. To process information, the brain must first store it. Various memory types include sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information is encoded uniquely for each sensory stimulus type, such as structurally for printed words, phonemically for sounds, or semantically for meanings. Once stored, information must be maintained, and studies suggest working memory uses electrical signals looping through neurons for a short period. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in specific protein structures. Several models describe how knowledge is organized in the brain, including those based on human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as nodes linked by their relatedness. For example, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes a critical stance against the impending threat of both technology and the capitalist system that supports it, as depicted in his dystopian novel Brave New World. The people in this society prioritize community over individuality and are conditioned from birth to pursue immediate gratification. The citizens are essentially pawns in a grand game, controlled by the World Controller who dictates their ideology. Analyzing the novel through the lens of Marxist criticism, we find that Huxley's reservations about the development of these systems are evident. Terms like homogenization and reification reinforce the idea that the novel is a commentary on the flaws in the emerging economy during Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is satirized through the concept of false consciousness, a Marxist thesis. Essentially, common citizens are prevented from understanding their true economic relations to other classes, as they are primarily focused on their own interests. This is a result of ideological control over the proletariat and the laboring classes, evident in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The various social classes, such as Delta and Gamma, lack any real will of their own, as their drive to consume and indulge is strengthened through hypnopædia. This manipulation is carried out by the World Controller. Hegemony, the idea that one social class is dominated by another, is clearly present here. The lower classes are completely unaware of this manipulation, essentially 'buying into an ideology that supports the structure' (i.e., capitalism and consumerism). Even the upper classes, like Alphas and Betas, typically accept their place, with few exceptions like Bernard. The interactions between the social classes also indicate the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are shallow and lack depth. Characters, even the major ones, are not well-defined, suggesting that technology and capitalism together may deprive people of their free will and expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, with interactions kept superficial. Males often comment on women's physical attributes, while females discuss their encounters. This superficiality indicates the socioeconomic effect of capitalism. The absolute obedience of each societal class to their role in the community reflects Marxist thoughts on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority so long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for nearly two and a half years, which is four and a half semesters. Getting around campus can be a real challenge. During my freshman year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm, the farthest from the center of campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to classes in places like Willard building, which is near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially on days when the weather was bad. I talked to an older alum who told me that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by vast empty fields. Now, those spaces are filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and the new health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to grow, navigating from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. What's the best solution to this mobility problem? The answer is bicycles. But having a bike doesn't solve all problems. Students need to ride them regularly, and the campus needs to be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nJust the other day, I was chatting with a friend who recently started cycling again after taking a break. He said, \"Bikes are fantastic! For a few years, they weren't the coolest thing to ride, but they're the only way to commute around.\" Cycling is not only good for your body but also the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus, just as far from the center as some dorms are. The best decision I made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have a class in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding my bike can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. However, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas from my house, and it's not always an easy road to navigate, whether by bike or on foot. There are certainly benefits to walking, but I barely have time for that. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day. That's more than two and a half hours each week. Add to that the time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on. That's more time than I can spare."
