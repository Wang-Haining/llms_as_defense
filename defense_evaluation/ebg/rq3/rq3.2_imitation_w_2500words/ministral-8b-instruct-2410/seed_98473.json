            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In my pursuit of an education in social work, I aim to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services, dedicated to assisting abused or neglected children and supporting troubled families. Core values that I bring to the social work field include service, respect, ethical integrity, and a commitment to improve relationships and continually enhance my professional competence. These values are not just vital for social workers; they are essential to my personal growth. I have always aspired to help others, but was uncertain of the right career path. During my high school and college years, I witnessed many individuals avoiding their problems in denial and using ineffective coping mechanisms. This influenced my decision to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break to reflect on my future. One summer day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. He was escaping his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police. I offered to help and drove to his parents’ house, where I spoke to the police and expressed my concerns. The police, seeing limited legal recourse, asked me to talk to the parents. When I questioned them about their son's “manipulative” behavior, they seemed nervous and made excuses. This experience led me to consider a career in social work to help children with family disputes.\n\nAnother crucial value in social work is social justice. Our society claims to value individuality yet often mourns lost individuals while striving to conform. I refuse to limit myself to societal norms. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively protested social injustice: dyeing my hair unnatural colors, wearing unique clothing, piercing my ears beyond traditional norms, declaring my involvement with GSBA, and fighting against racism and discrimination. I firmly believe in social justice and will continue to stand against injustice.",
            "The following paper delves into the Biological and Sociocultural models when it comes to the sleep disorder insomnia. The Biological model emphasizes inherited genetic factors and medical aspects, while the Sociocultural model explores environmental influences like race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models and presents research to explain and relate to them. Each study's findings and explanations are then critiqued for their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized into three main types: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders related to other mental disorders, and sleep disorders linked to medical conditions or substance intake. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias involve issues with initiating or maintaining sleep, such as Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, and Narcolepsy. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are characterized by abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep, like Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder. Sleep disorders linked to other mental disorders are related to Axis I or Axis II disorders.\n\nThe paper primarily focuses on insomnia and touches on primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models. The Biological model identifies genetic and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. For instance, neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice found that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep/wake states. Activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition causes reduced anxiety and sleep induction. The use of GABAB agonists like baclofen increased sleep time in the study, suggesting that mice and humans share similar genetic and environmental factors affecting sleep. This suggests that a malfunction in these receptors could impair sleep quality without medication. Socioculturally, this could mean that inherited traits influence sleep, and any alteration in these receptors could disrupt sleep and negatively impact daily life tasks.",
            "Alright, let me break this down into three main points. First off, we gotta understand what's up with Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short. It's basically the brain's ability to process what we hear, and when that doesn't work right, you've got CAPD. You can hear alright, but your brain's just not translating it as it should.\n\nNow, this disorder's been around since the mid-50s, back when it was called \"auditory imperception\". The Italians were the ones who started evaluating kids with comms disorders, and Kimura came up with that dichotic testing stuff. And in 1977, a big conference got everyone talking about CAPD, which led to more research.\n\nCAPD can show up in a bunch of ways. You might have trouble figuring out where sounds are coming from, or you might struggle to tell two sounds apart. Maybe you can't pick up on patterns or changes in speech, like detecting sarcasm. Or, you might have trouble hearing one sound over another. And sometimes, you just can't make sense of what you hear, or follow the order of what's being said.\n\nTo diagnose it, you need to look at how someone listens and performs on tests. This can be done by audiologists, speech therapists, psychologists, and others. There's no one-size-fits-all test, and the cause is still unknown. Some tests might play multiple sounds at once and ask you to pick out certain ones. Others might record sounds in your ear and measure your responses.",
            "Twelfth Night seems to say that although masquerade is in fact a useful tool for carrying out prolonged deceptions, in the end, a person must shed that newly adopted persona, or else risk losing oneself. The challenge of ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves estranged as a result. Therefore, one must ultimately choose between one’s own self-preservation or preserving relationships with those around them. Although some may accept the deception with neutrality, others may take it quite seriously and be offended by the charade.\n\nThe issue of deception in gender role reversal is particularly troublesome, as it raises numerous side questions, with the most crucial one being why? Why does the subject feel the need to discard their own identity and take on the guise of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it is clearly a form of self-defense: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) Having newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels compelled to pretend to be a man to safeguard herself from potential assailants. Her plan works, but it also isolates her from the women around her, cutting her off from a vital support network. To make matters worse, she is so convincing in her disguise that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) She also has to grapple with suppressed romantic feelings between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261)\n\nWhile this could be seen as a progressive stance, to a modern reader, Twelfth Night may serve as an example of how deception can help uncover repressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Some passages suggest that these characters may harbor unexpressed subconscious desires that the presence of Viola/Cesario forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because he appears to be a man, or does she secretly have feelings for women? One might argue that this is not the case, as Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems to be more likely to judge others based solely on their appearance.\n\nThis is evident by the ease with which Olivia shifts her romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to view Cesario/Viola as a family member rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "Another month has passed. Life's been pretty much the same, nothing much happening. But let me fill you in on what did occur. I finally completed the beta version of the tradenet website, after a lot of procrastination, I'll admit. Probably gonna register the domain and launch the site around the middle of January. The delay was due to a lack of funds and a means to transfer it to the web host. My partner's getting his credit card in January, so that's when we'll set it up. I also flunked accounting. I guess I knew it was coming, but it still stings. I scored a 47 out of 100. I put in an appeal, not expecting much, but at least there's hope. I did get distinctions for law and economics, though. I suppose if you like a course, you're more motivated to do well in it. But if it's easy to understand, you're more likely to like it. So it's a catch-22 situation. I'll find out the appeal result this week, fingers crossed.\n\nNot much else has happened, so that's all for now. Until next time.\n\nSo, I've been dealing with this affliction called shyness. Talking to strangers, especially the opposite sex, turns me into jelly. I can't think, start trembling, and freeze up. It happened today at the YEN meeting. Couldn't even tell Genevieve that I hadn't received the club mailing list invitation. I'm working on this, though. That's one of the reasons I joined YEN - to force myself into situations that make me interact with strangers, especially those from the opposite gender. I won't get anywhere in life if I can't do this. It's so frustrating to want something so bad but be too afraid to reach out and grab it. I WILL overcome this disability. The only way is through increased interaction.\n\nAnother problem I'm dealing with is negative thinking, which affects my motivation. I don't want to sound cliché, but it's true. It's mostly my mom's fault. She's so negative all the time, and it's rubbed off on me. I'm working on changing this, though. I talked to a YEN guy I met through Darren, a total 'Adam Knoo' convert. He made me realize how negative my thoughts have been lately. I'm going to stop using the word 'try' and use 'MUST' instead. It makes a huge difference. I MUST come up with a study and work schedule this Sunday and STICK to it.\n\nWell, Kings got himself a girlfriend. Wouldn't have thought that would happen anytime soon. Shows how life can surprise you. I don't blame him, but the reasons for their relationship are a bit suspect. I'm not sure if he's really into her or if he's just trying to prove something to himself. I hope he's happy, though.\n\nI've been lazy about updating my blog for a while, but I'm back now. School holidays are here, and I hope I passed all my papers. I'm heading down to the registry of companies today to register a business partnership with Kumar. I'm calling it 'Epac Trading Company' in honor of our earlier partnership plans. I'm also working on tradenet, which I loathe, but I promised I'd do it.\n\nI just read an article about Bill Cosby's remarks on the culture of victimism in America. It made me think about the culture of victimism in the civilized world today. I get tired of people blaming everything but themselves for their troubles. Unless you're mentally incapacitated, you're responsible for your life. What's the point of blaming everything? Why not take action? I'm trying to do that by setting specific life goals and being disciplined about working towards them. You can't go anywhere if you don't have a clear goal.\n\nI slept at 10 last night, something I haven't done in ages. I must study economics tomorrow, MUST. Saying 'will' is not enough, I need to say 'MUST'. I MUST complete the first three topics tomorrow. I know it's ambitious, considering my procrastinating past, but I MUST do it. I'm answering to myself, and lying to myself is far worse than lying to anyone else.\n\nIt's been a week and a half since the last semester ended. The holidays flew by. This is probably the last holiday I'll have to laze around and do nothing. The next one, at the end of this year, will be busy with the DPP project and starting up the tuition center. The following one, in mid-2005, I'll be in Melbourne at RMIT for most of that month. I look forward to earning my keep, but I don't want to leave the security of school so soon. But time marches on, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. I just hope life doesn't chew me up and spit me out. But that's just being pessimistic. Remember, the glass is half full!\n\nI was just in a contemplative mood, thinking about how it's sad that good friends can grow apart as you grow up. You gain new perspectives, and those might not align with your friends. Sometimes it's due to differing views or circumstances. Some things are out of your control, but most aren't. It's a choice we all have to make. I've had many good people in my life. It's sad to reminisce about the good times, but I don't want to hold them back from shaping me into the person I am today or the person I'll be tomorrow. The choices we make.",
            "The classification of popular music has expanded over the last 100 years to encompass a vast array of genres, making it challenging to list them all. This is further complicated by the fact that most genres, from rap to country, and jazz to folk, have spawned numerous sub and sub-sub genres. Heavy Metal rock, particularly, has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in popular music over the past 40 years. It's expressive because it conveys a wide range of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker side of the spectrum. It's also diverse as individuals quickly recognized its flexibility, leading to the creation of their own sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a chain that continues to this day.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement has evolved to the point where it's hard to define what exactly heavy metal is. It has absorbed themes from various other genres but, like everything else, it originated from somewhere. To truly understand the metal music prevalent today, one must first comprehend what the metal movement is and why it's considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement shaped by darkness. It can be seen as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. There's less primitivism and more technical skill; metal bands truly know how to play their instruments, and it's evident in their music. Metal is also, notably, a drug-induced movement. The mid-70s psychedelic drug boom led to artists creating wild, otherworldly records, using drugs as a catalyst for their creation. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which was new to the music scene as much of popular music didn't delve into the darker emotional spectrum. Later generations of metal artists also took inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like the following exemplify this:",
            "A few decades before the Surrealists began painting their dreamlike works, Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own dreams in both literal and figurative ways. The Dream, a painting from 1910 by the renowned Post-Impressionist, depicts not just a woman in awe of the wonders she experiences in a dream, but also Rousseau’s own dreams and aspirations as an artist. Ever since he started his journey, he longed for recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art lovers, only to confront a challenging internal conflict: to either imitate existing styles to gain acceptance or to forge his own unique path. The Dream encapsulates Rousseau’s lifelong struggle with this dilemma.\n\nTo truly understand The Dream, we must first delve into Rousseau’s life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France, his father was a prosperous tinsmith and hardware dealer. He grew up without formal art training and worked as a gabelou for France until the age of forty, erroneously known as a douanier, or customs inspector. After the loss of his first wife and eight children, Rousseau turned to painting for solace and new beginnings. Unlike many of his contemporaries, who romanticized the peasant in their paintings, Rousseau was a folk artist, reflecting the aspirations and dreams of the common class.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance by the art world is understandable given his background: he was uneducated in formal painting and began his career later in life, working alongside more established and recognized artists. It was not until around the same time that Matisse was building his reputation that Rousseau started to gain recognition for his art. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, “Matisse was a painter who feared painting in a conventional way, while Rousseau strove to paint in a conventional manner to be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Another thing that's captured my attention is the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics that many great thinkers have explored. It's not just about education or experience, but something more profound. As John Keats put it in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Ethics and aesthetics seem to talk to each other without us even realizing it. We often study art and morals to understand why something is beautiful or right, rather than to prescribe specific rules for beauty or morality. Even when we try to describe what makes a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa great, we often find ourselves saying, \"There's just something about it\" before diving into a more complex explanation. This is because art and morals can't be fully captured by description alone. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Both art and morals have this transcendent quality, this ineffable \"something\" that makes them so powerful. This \"something\" is what connects ethics and aesthetics. I believe this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics is the reason they feel so deeply impactful, especially when it comes to literature. As McKean argues, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts... is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany in its present form is a powerful, united country, with a rich cultural tapestry that weaves through its landscape, from the scenic Alps in München to the Baltic Sea coastal city of Kiel. This unique blend of culture is evident whether you are in Köln by the Rhine, the heart of Germany, or the historical city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given the diverse origins of its inhabitants, it's not surprising that Germany, as we know it today, is a fusion of various tribes and influences.\n\nThe origins of the name \"Germania\" are shrouded in historical debate. Some scholars claim it comes from the Germanic tribe known as Tungrians, who were once called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, first used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others suggest the name is derived from the German spear, known as a \"ger\" (O.E.D., 2010), or from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" implying the Germans were loud or warlike (Names of Germany).\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" described the Germans as \"aboriginal\" and not mixed with other races through immigration. He questioned why anyone would leave the warm climates of Asia or Africa for the harsher lands of Germany, with its wild terrain, harsh weather, and stern demeanor (Tacitus, 98). The Romans, while they often raided German lands for resources, generally preferred to return to their own empire rather than settle in Germania (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).\n\nAs the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the outskirts of the Roman Empire. They traded their land-grown goods and served in the Roman army, integrating their skills and culture into the Roman fold (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I looked down at the view in front of me, my mind as blank as the scene itself. Silently, unemotionally, with a practiced eye that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding, I analyzed the picture. Thoughts flowed in and out like a gentle stream. It was as if I had no thoughts of my own, just an active and fluid experience of what I was seeing. Once, an artist I worked with suggested I get a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had always wanted to learn to draw, and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to the brain's processes for interpreting lines. One technique it teaches is to place a square frame around any picture to simplify it. At that moment, standing there, I couldn't mentally project that frame. I was too overwhelmed, too awed. I felt like I was at the beginning of my own artistic journey, starting my own story. Fingertips lightly touched my chosen art tool, muscles tensed and relaxed as I began to recreate the scene in my mind. Water swirled smoothly, crystals clear and clean. A flurry of matter broke away, carried away to nothingness. My hand smacked the handle again, the brown package still stubbornly in place. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet thought, and then I gripped the toilet paper like a gloved hand. I stood up, then bent at the waist, and slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, like a mother retrieving a Thanksgiving turkey from the oven...",
            "Another grim trend has emerged among our youth, one that's been claiming lives behind the wheel. Several elements converge to create this deadly pattern for our youngest drivers. The National Institutes of Health highlight that the teen brain is simply not equipped to handle the perils of driving, and this lack of experience leads to more fatal accidents, as well as a higher rate of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. But the hazards don't stop there—teens are even more vulnerable when driving with their friends, a fact that anyone with an inkling of common sense understands. Studies have shown that the presence of passengers, especially teens, significantly increases the risk of accidents. California and other states have implemented measures like temporary provisional licenses, limiting driving hours and passengers, but these are merely Band-Aids. The core issue is that, collectively, our youngest drivers aren't ready to handle the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman even suggests that 18 is too young for a standard driver's license, citing research that shows teens under 19-20 often seek out thrills and risks. Therefore, delaying driving until this tendency subsides could help reduce accidents and save lives. By 2010, the first wave of Baby Boomer's children will be eligible to drive, potentially adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads. A sensible solution is to continue driver's education classes in schools, but no one under 18 should be allowed to drive a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued, with a set number of practical driving hours required, mirroring existing state requirements. Uniform, national legislation could help protect teens across the country. This approach is not a new idea.",
            "After sifting through the Library of Congress’s treasure trove of early Edison films, I made it my mission to watch all the trick films from 1895 to 1901, numbering fifteen in total. These films are known for their clever use of editing to create illusions. My study primarily focused on describing the poetic elements of the bulk of these trick films and exploring the unique qualities of a few of the latter films. Most trick films from this era adhere to a set-bound style, confined within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, and utilizing long and medium shots. They stick to the one shot equals one film method. However, some films at the dawn of the twentieth century were bold enough to break these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common thread among these trick films is their use of an interior set confined within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationery, not moving to follow figures or objects. This style finds its roots in the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. The constraint of the stage means that figures in trick films usually move side-to-side, never walking towards or away from the camera. A clear example is the action in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). Actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, but the camera never follows them out of the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also dictates that shots are typically long and occasionally medium shots. Close-ups are absent from all the trick films in the Edison catalog. This is a nod to the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where audiences saw the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. As in most early films, actors don’t move towards the camera, so close-ups are non-existent.\n\nMost early trick films follow the rule that one conceptual shot equates to one film. This caps the length at about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. It also limits the dramatic or narrative scope of the films; most focus on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. However, in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes doesn’t correspond to a physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be composed of several joined together to create illusions of apparition or disappearing. Examine The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A closer look reveals that the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "So John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republicanism. Though primarily an agriculturalist, his career in politics greatly influenced his dedication and vocal support for personal freedom and government. His commitment to an agrarian system shaped his views on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the United States as a unique opportunity to create an ideal system, unhampered by traditional constraints, allowing for self-government. He firmly believed in the natural rights of man, asserting their interdependence—if one is denied, the rest fail, and their remaining value diminishes. These rights should remain beyond government reach. He argued that the \"state of nature\" allowed the powerful and malevolent to thrive, but civilization must prevent this.\n\nTo establish an ideal society, Taylor believed a government should account for human goodness and evil. He was rigid in his dualistic morality, claiming, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). Good principles, like protecting private property and agriculture, and discouraging capitalism, were fundamental. A government founded on these principles would function fairly despite its administration's self-interest.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans of his time, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution. He wanted a minimal Federal Government, with no rights or powers beyond those explicitly stated. He recognized potential corruption in a literal interpretation without considering the writers' intent. He considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter, as it described the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Alright, so let's revisit Figure 17. A major dip in commuter log submissions happened in the third month of our project. That was a bit of a bummer, and the reason behind it? Well, it's a bit unclear. The New England winter might've been the culprit, with fewer folks commuting by bike or on foot. Plus, December is the end of the semester, leaving many with schoolwork and grades on their minds, possibly causing the log to slip their radar. On top of that, the holiday season brings a month-long break for students and faculty, with many not needing to come to campus at all. Classes resume in late January, which could explain the low February log submissions. But what about the February dip? It could just be a natural ebb and flow of excitement with any new project. To combat this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which did bring back some of our log submissions. So, we faced the challenge of keeping the momentum going despite holiday breaks and a decline in natural excitement. Another big issue for this or any similar project is the deep cultural love for the freedom and flexibility of driving. To counter this, we offered various prizes like gift cards to local places. It'd be awesome to see if bigger prizes like a bicycle, hybrid, or electric car would've boosted participation. The value of the prizes didn't change throughout the project, but announcing bigger prizes later might've helped. The gift cards were great at the start, but adding some bicycles and cars as bigger prizes could've been a game-changer.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of investment that is designed to mimic the performance of an index, a commodity, or a group of assets, similar to an index fund. However, unlike index funds, ETFs trade like stocks on an exchange. This setup offers several advantages: the diversification of an index fund, the flexibility of selling short, buying on margin, and the ability to purchase as few as one share at a time. While these benefits are enticing, it's important to note that ETFs come with a downside—the need to pay a commission on trades, much like stock orders. Additionally, ETFs offer a wide range of funds to choose from. However, as a savvy investor, it's crucial to assess whether the stated advantages, such as diversification, genuinely exist and to what extent they do so.\n\nFor this analysis, let's examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of its total assets. The top holdings and their respective percentages are as follows:\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we can calculate the contribution of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio were composed entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions that the ETF has established. The Beta and Return calculations for each stock are shown in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it's clear that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, a 16% increase. Moreover, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 points lower than the ETF's overall Beta. These initial results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower risk, but it's essential to determine if these portfolios are statistically different from one another.\n\nTo assess this, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is often regarded as one of his superior works. Within it, he employs the term \"Thulé,\" which Mabbott attributes to Virgil. Virgil referred to an island north of Britain, marking the edge of the known world. While Virgil indeed used the term, a more recent and significant influence should be recognized. Poe was deeply interested in German literature, particularly the works of Goethe.\n\nThis knowledge is significant because it reveals Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" notes the similarities between the two poets' works, suggesting that Poe was inspired by Goethe. Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of poetic drama, including his magnum opus \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his death. Within \"Faust,\" Part II contains a short poem titled \"The King of Thule,\" which tells of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. Overwhelmed by sorrow, he drinks heavily and cries, then decides to end his life by throwing the goblet into the sea. His actions and the description of the king in \"Dream-Land\" bear a striking resemblance, hinting at a dark reflection of Poe's own experiences.\n\nPoe references \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but in \"Dream-Land,\" he uses the term as a framing device. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a dark, lonely landscape where he is haunted by deceased friends, which mirrors the feelings of the king in \"The King of Thule.\" Both poems depict a world without color and life, suggesting that the speaker has stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was an influential author, and Poe would have been exposed to his work through various reproductions and his admiration for Tennyson, whom Poe greatly respected. When asked if he admired Tennyson, Poe's response underscored his familiarity with German literature and the works of Goethe.",
            "Alright, another thing I'd like to talk about is this legal conundrum. Could a customer injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice? Well, under California law, it's not a clear-cut case. To prove punitive damages, the plaintiff needs to show that the defendant's actions were intentional and that they were committed with a willful disregard for the probable harm that would result. In Jennifer Palmer's case, she fell on an applesauce spill that was reported twice to the manager, Paul Martin, but he failed to clean it up because he was eating dinner. Six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the store before Palmer's accident, so it's reasonable for her to argue that Martin should have known the risk and still failed to act. However, proving that Martin's actions were despicable might be more challenging. But given the circumstances, her claim is not without merit.",
            "Four years ago, I took a course on Islam at CBC where a significant topic of debate was whether Islam is inherently hostile. This discussion remains pertinent today. Since 9/11, I've witnessed a shift in media portrayal, from hostility towards both Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance toward Islam in America. In 2001, it would've been unthinkable to imagine a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who has a Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe life story of Muhammad, as presented in the biography, is intriguing but seems to contradict historical accounts. From what I know, Muhammad was depicted as a forceful figure who conquered tribes and coerced them into adopting Islam. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble, who attracted followers through his teachings and miracles. This portrayal seems designed to present him as a humble prophet who needed no proof but was centered around truth and miracles. This approach trivializes the life and miracles of Jesus, as if Muhammad is being used to take credit for Jesus' life and personhood.\n\nAdditionally, many stories in the biography suggest an agenda to provide evidence of voluntary conversions. However, these accounts often come from third-party sources, which I find suspicious. For instance, the author might claim to have heard from someone who heard it from someone else, weakening the credibility of the stories.\n\nWhat bothers me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man. Historical records suggest otherwise, and I can't help but wonder if current Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "So, the lessons Jesus taught and his beliefs during his life have been left behind in the evolution of Christian thought, which has since moved on from its roots after his life. If we look at the broader picture, we see that Christianity has strayed further and further from its origin over time. Today's world shows an increasing awareness and unprecedented progressiveness. While traditional people and thinkers still exist and might resist any new ideas, they may not have the influence to shape the whole. Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a growing desire to distinguish the doctrines that have been added to Christianity over time from the original intent of the religion's founder. It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable: a reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a movement that removes layers of doctrine, one by one, as if the clock is turning back, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God remains, before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend spreads through the United States and Europe, influencing masses to worship as if they were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of every kind, we will see increasing similarities instead of differences. Human history is filled with great reversions. An example is how Christians once were persecuted, shunned, and killed by the Roman Empire, but later that empire became a Christian institution. Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process. It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus' words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements. So, what happened after Jesus' lifetime?\n\nLooking far back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were all at the core of the religion even as the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not united. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "Oh, so The Jungle, it's all about how humans, deep down, are greedy and self-centred, huh? They're all about making their own lives as cushy as possible, never mind who gets stepped on along the way. Sinclair makes it crystal clear with his descriptions of the factory owners and managers. They're just after big, fat profits, not caring a whit about anyone or anything in their path, including the pollution they spew out. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" he writes. They couldn't care less about the smoke, the animal waste, or even the people they're exploiting.\n\nAnd the workers? Well, they're just tools for these greedy folks to make money with. They'll do anything to squeeze out an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". Workers are forced to work in appalling conditions, with no job security and no safety net. Back then, there were barely any laws protecting workers' rights, so managers could run amok, pushing workers to the breaking point. And if you can't handle it, well, tough luck. There were no unions to help, just more people looking to make a buck off the workers' misery. It was a system of slavery, plain and simple, with workers \"dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors have their own methods to evoke certain feelings or ideas in their readers, with some techniques proving more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs a variety of these methods in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he combines an adjective and a noun in an unusual way to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. Other times, he imbues a symbol with meaning and then uses it to convey that same meaning. Fitzgerald frequently uses this latter technique with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel, he attributes specific meanings to white/gray and red/pink before later employing those meanings to evoke feelings around important objects.\n\nFitzgerald associates white/gray with uniformity, with white being slightly more elegant and refined, and gray representing something older and worn. He establishes this connection at the beginning of the novel by repeatedly using both colors. Daisy and Jordan are continually “in white” (8), and everyone else is dressed in white as well: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears a “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). The only exceptions are when Nick is observing Gatsby’s party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). He also uses these colors to describe ordinary objects and people: the “names” at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray” (61) on Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—uniformity (28). He uses white/gray to describe ordinary or common people and places, such as Daisy and Jordan having a “white girlhood” (19), the “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\n\nAfter building up these meanings, Fitzgerald employs them to signify unimportance or uniformity for certain subjects. This use of colors to convey meaning starts with Daisy. After a prolonged period without significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster,” causing readers to perceive her as less of a character and more like a uniform object that Gatsby desires and longs for (74). He continues this technique around Daisy to emphasize her uniformity, for example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",
            "San Diego County is pretty much a powerhouse when it comes to agriculture, with its mild and sunny climate. The area's main crops include tomatoes, lemons, peaches, berries, honey, and a variety of leafy greens, squash, broccoli, and peppers. There's a pretty solid demand in the area for organic, community-supported agriculture, with many local groups having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also quite popular. Many organic farms here offer tours of their operations and access for activities like hiking and birdwatching, which can help the landowner make some extra cash or provide educational experiences. This kind of setup would let the landowner benefit from government programs while also improving habitat, providing recreational activities, and creating opportunities for farm tours and other programs.",
            "So, culture, it's a big deal in any negotiation. It's not something you can define with one word or one stereotype. It's like saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" right? That's way too broad and simple. Instead, it's better to understand how a culture affects the conversation at hand and how it plays into the negotiation. When you're dealing with a foreign culture, you'll compare it to your own, and that's normal. But it's important not to judge or change a culture, but to work within it, especially if you're at a disadvantage.\n\nUnderstanding a culture can mean looking into its past or seeing its prejudices. You don't have to agree with them or try to change them, just accept them for what they are. And when you're in a foreign environment, respect can go a long way in breaking down cultural barriers and moving the negotiation forward.\n\nCulture isn't just about national boundaries. Companies also have their own cultures. Some might value long work hours, others a relaxed schedule. You can see a company's culture in how employees dress, how they communicate, and how they hire. Even within the same country, there's a lot of diversity. For example, American companies can have very different cultures. Some might encourage employee philanthropy, others might restrict it. The point is, a lot of thought goes into the culture of a society or a company.\n\nValues are key too, because they tell you why a culture is the way it is. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, you won't publicly shame anyone at the negotiation table. And if a culture values a hard-driven bargain, you won't settle too quickly. Understanding these generalities before you start negotiating can really help. But it's also important to learn about your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation effective.",
            "So, as it stands, let's assume that both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas are onto something with their beliefs in the existence of the God of the Bible. After all, they're both arguing for the same thing, so we'll start with that premise. However, I'm not convinced that either of them really gives a solid foundation for believing in God. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at St. Anselm's argument. He's all about finding God within ourselves, using our own understanding to prove his existence. He says that because God is within our comprehension, we can't really grasp his nonexistence. It's a bit convoluted, but the gist is that we don't need external evidence to know God is real; we just need to look inside ourselves. This is essentially faith, as it's accepting something without irrefutable proof.\n\nNow, contrast that with Thomas Aquinas. He's all about reason and empirical evidence. He believes we can prove God's existence using logic, without any faith. This is super handy for conversions, as we can convince people with reasoning alone. He's got five arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He shows that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for his existence.\n\nSo, while they both have valid points, I think neither really gives a complete picture for believing in God.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future Buddha was born. Over his lifetime, he gave up the world, attained enlightenment, and his teachings became Buddhism, specifically Theravada Buddhism, which has existed for around twenty-five hundred years. The religion, from its customs to its core beliefs, has evolved since Buddha's time. For instance, in Sri Lanka, a Theravada nation, an annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated, a practice Buddha never taught. Differences extend from superficial traditions to the religion's essence. Both monastic and lay communities have had to adjust their doctrines over time due to external and internal influences, both friendly and hostile.\n\nThis discussion will frequently use terms like internal and external forces. Internal forces come from Buddhists, regardless of their status, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces harm or aim to harm the Buddhist community, born of a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces, while not intentionally helping or harming, may do so as a result.\n\nLet's start by understanding the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. The Dhamma, composed of the Tripitaka—three baskets of Buddhist texts—includes the Sutta Pitaka (Suttas), Vinaya Pitaka (disciplinary rules), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical components like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering, and Anicca—impermanence of all things). Recognizing these concepts helps end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and cease lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, upon enlightenment.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for life. Laypeople follow five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances), while monks follow many more rules. The four noble truths form the fundamental doctrine: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The height of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States defeated Mexico and gained new territories like Texas and the American Southwest (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). Apart from this war, there were numerous other skirmishes between the two nations that finally subsided just before World War I.\n\nThis scenario is not unique to the U.S. and Mexico; many nations that share a border often have disputes due to shared interests. David M. Pletcher (1977) points out that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41), stressing the closeness of these nations to the U.S. and their historic rivalries, unlike other Latin American nations which have typically enjoyed good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious issues were a significant factor in the rivalry between the U.S. and Mexico, much like the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). The enduring distrust between the U.S. and Mexico can be traced back to the historical tension between the English and Spanish, which carried over into their colonial legacies.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during their 57-year rivalry, with most of these disputes being territorial issues related to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a persistent problem until both nations exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to wane as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and ended as American ambitions shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century.",
            "Fifteen‭ ‬years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly struck down by an illness that I had never known existed. I was a nurse at the time, having chosen my profession out of a deep-seated need for the safety and security that eluded me as a child. The mantra I heard as I grew older was, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" So, even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist—preferably a bit of both—I chose nursing.\n\nYet there I was: 46‭ ‬years old, single, with no money to speak of, and unable to work. To this day, I am disabled, and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability, I have absolutely nothing left that I can call my own. I manage to get by, but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, yet there's one thing I know to be true—I could not have made it through these years without the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. And believe me, when real disaster strikes, you do not feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life—big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well one prepares, some things are just too big to overcome on one's own.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that we in the U.S. need to stop relying so heavily on big government. Lord knows it's crumbling. Yet, I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again—learning to help each other and to ask for help—rather than each of us individually scrambling to build fallout shelters in our backyards.\n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country, but in truth, what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism, it was compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit—first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and plastic sheeting for the windows in case of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and batteries, candle and waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food—do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "So, why do organisms evolve the way they do? Are there limits or constraints that guide evolutionary change? While in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson stated that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" the same can still be said today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny, for example, as seen in Raup and Stanley's work from 1981. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help understand the mechanisms behind the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to define quantitative parameters that could be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that extends through 360 degrees of space over time. These turns or revolutions of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis called the columella. The columella runs through the central column of the shell. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, known as a suture. The largest whorl of a shell is typically the last one, called the body whorl, with the spire being all the whorls except the last one. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is the base. The animal exits its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture pointing toward the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical view and determine where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts, then count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures traveling through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced via the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is made, parameters can be varied and modified to alter the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "Well, another decade has passed, and Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates haven't moved an inch. While the country's on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, like water and sanitation, the progress in child and maternal health has been dismally slow, falling short of the target. Let's delve into the reasons behind these shortcomings and the urgent need to bolster the overall health system rather than just focusing on specific programs.\n\nLooking at the numbers, it's clear that Indonesia's progress in having skilled birth attendants is somewhat misleading. While 72% of births now have a skilled worker present, traditional midwives can't provide medical interventions, leading to a high maternal death rate from hemorrhage. Additionally, there's a decline in treating diarrheal cases in children under five. Postnatal care data is also incomplete, but it's evident that this area needs attention, with low rates across the country. Cesarian-section rates are still low, at 4%, but there's a worrying discrepancy between urban and rural areas, with a 5% rate in cities and only 2% in rural settings. This inequity in access to healthcare is clear, as is the stark difference in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, with a 27% gap.\n\nWhen considering next steps for improving neonatal and maternal care, a crucial question is how to tackle the service gap effectively. Should Indonesia focus on program-specific approaches or strengthen the health system as a whole? Programmatic approaches are attractive because they offer targeted, manageable goals and quicker results. However, investing heavily in one area can lead to funding shortages and human resource migration to better-resourced sectors. Plus, running multiple parallel programs can cause duplications and uncoordinated services, resulting in increased paperwork.\n\nSo, there's a need to balance these approaches and consider both.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocracy. Two notable exceptions to this norm are 'Oliver Twist' and 'Wuthering Heights'. These works add an element of mystery and a hint of the unusual, which helps to deepen the characters within each story, providing insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“And now, a multitude of bewildering and confusing thoughts rushed into his mind. It seemed as if he was still walking between Sikes and Crackit, arguing fiercely. The very words they spoke echoed in his ears, and he realized that he was actually talking to them. Suddenly, he recoiled at the sound of gunshots. Shouts and screams filled his ears, and lights flashed before his eyes, everything was chaos and commotion, as an unseen force carried him away quickly. Throughout these vivid visions, a constant, vague sense of pain gnawed at him, tormenting him endlessly.\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often use dream sequences or dreamlike states to incorporate this mystery. In 'Oliver Twist', these strange occurrences reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, his pains, and his awareness of the true nature of the events happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, it happens as if in a dream, as he struggles to find help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events, as well as the dire state his health had reached, as seen through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overpowers him, numbing his senses, and he doesn't notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away. He re-experiences his despair again, removed from the initial shock of pain, now linked with constant fear. The question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, as it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything, even while his life is in danger. A sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied, suggesting that old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed – or did it? There was no day; it was gone as soon as it began – and night came on again; a night that was endless yet fleeting, long in its dreadful silence and brief in its hurried hours.",
            "A couple of years back, I was working in an after-school program, tutoring younger kids. I did my best to assist them in their studies, but my strongest subjects were English and reading. I was asked by one of the instructors to help a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. He was in third or fourth grade and spoke perfect English, which made his reading difficulties particularly puzzling. At first, I thought Adrian had some peculiar problems. He could pronounce some letters correctly, but others, not at all. It was strange. He was of Latino descent, and I knew his mother only spoke Spanish. When she came to pick him up, I realized his issue was not with reading but with knowing the English alphabet. I don't know if that revelation helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier problem in schools, especially in California. It's often not as clear-cut as we think, even for a child who speaks perfect English. Reading can still be a real challenge. This issue is acknowledged, but what can we do about it? In Adrian's case, the solution was simple: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for many children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer. Combining dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, or any of these methods alone won't fix the problem. The key is to combine all these approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a fantastic idea, not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all children. Studies have shown that children in these programs outperform their peers academically. This idea is often feared as a waste of resources, but that's not accurate. If implemented widely, all children would benefit. How, though? Should we make all teachers bilingual? No, that's unreasonable. However, having bilingual aides or tutors available would be a practical solution.",
            "Since childhood, many of us are told about a force greater than ourselves, something we can't fully understand. Some learn about it at Sunday school, others at the Temple, or delve within themselves for answers. Often, we follow the religions passed down by our parents, but some reject them outright, denying any existence beyond our personal, egocentric worlds. Our values and belief systems may shift over time, but our spiritual journeys are uniquely ours. We search for light to guide us out of the darkness. \"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked him about his favorite bird. We sat on our porch, listening to the rain, our cigarettes offering a brief respite from the tension. He looked out into the storm, his gaze both searching and remembering. His body was gaunt, his hair sparse. I couldn't bring myself to talk about his passing, afraid it would make the reality more tangible. I hugged him, repositioned my chair, and stared into the falling rain together.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just days after I turned twenty-two. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering but not eased it. I couldn't watch my father's life end. I wanted to remember him as he lived, not die. I hid in my bed for three days, waiting for news. No one called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is essentially an \"oxymoronic fusion of 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt points out in his book The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both reviled and lauded, accused of being shallow, and praised for its 'terrible sublime' effect (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined elements of both \"ancient and modern\" romances to birth the proto-Gothic genre and a novel way of literary expression. Walpole utilizes \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily on throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary advancements. This combination of more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing readers a deeper insight into character psychology) is what keeps Gothic literature enduring and both obsolete and fresh to readers from different times.\n\nOne of the most distinctive Gothic themes is the notion of Chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is particularly significant to Gothic writers because it represents the ideal knight—brave, honorable, and competent—and the perceived lack of these qualities in contemporary society. Through the use of chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized, hinting at the evolution of Gothic to Romantic literature, and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole, who wrote The Castle of Otranto during a politically troubled time and was despairing over the future, may have felt that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" of the gothic era had been lost in the individuals of 'present' society. This concept is evident in several characters, such as Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits. The reader learns that Frederic is a prince, has suffered tragedy, and is now believed to be killed by infidels, embodying the figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" (66).",
            "So, supply chain management is all about the flow of goods from a customer's order to raw materials, through production, distribution, and finally, the customer. The term was coined in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. He saw it as the planning, implementation, and control of the entire process to meet customer needs swiftly and efficiently. Now, there are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the tools business managers use to deliver top-notch customer service. Let's break it down:\n\nProduction is the first step in the chain. It's the backbone, outlining when, why, where, and how things get made. Managers need to know what customers want, so they look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator of what customers demand. Once they've analyzed it, they decide what to produce and how much. Then comes the location – where and which plant will be best for volume and quality, keeping the customer in mind. After that, it's about scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Production is crucial, every detail matters. For instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target. Both had detailed processes for everything from uniforms to receiving shipments. These processes help keep things running smoothly with clear direction and expectations.\n\nThe second key element is supply. This is about making strategic decisions to determine a facility's core capabilities and decide on outsourcing partnerships. A company might have several divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers decide which division is best for each process. They might also outsource work to other companies to create velocity – providing quality and flexibility while reducing or maintaining low costs.",
            "So, another shocking truth has come to light. There's a sign in Burma reading, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, the star of Juno, stood alone on a street corner with a cardboard sign, the message written in Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country under the control of a tyrannical military junta that seized power in 1962. Just a decade ago, the country saw widespread public protests led by Buddhist monks. These peaceful gatherings, known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" turned violent, with the military cracking down on the monks and ransacking monasteries. Foreign journalists were arrested and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed for being present at a protest. The official death toll is 13, but a defected colonel puts the number closer to several thousand.\n\nThis isn't new; it's a recurring theme throughout history. From early Roman emperors declaring themselves gods to the current U.S. president consulting with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, governments have always sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control. Notable instances include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where the official death toll ranges from 200 to 3,000, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the government, systematically murdered Tutsis. Nazi Germany's \"Third Reich\" is another extreme example, during which anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed. It's a grim reminder of the lengths governments will go to protect their power.",
            "Well, Duke Ellington's influence on jazz is primarily due to his perseverance and exceptional talent at orchestrating his band. His subtle presence on the piano in many tracks is overshadowed by his brilliance as a composer. Ellington was a master at crafting complex pieces that highlighted the unique skills of his musicians. He established a framework where soloists could freely improvise, while also writing intricate arrangements that showcased the distinct styles of his band members. This balance allowed him to create original and cohesive sounds that were tailor-made for each piece, resulting in some of the most innovative jazz compositions in history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of the voice as a musical instrument, as seen in his early piece, Creole Love Call. This song demonstrates his ability to incorporate the voice to add depth and color without lyrics. The piece features a call and response between the voice and reeds, with the voice starting smoothly and transitioning to a rougher sound by the end of the first chorus. The six-chorus structure showcases a variety of solos, from a muted trumpet solo in the second chorus to a soaring clarinet solo in the third. The climactic fifth chorus features a high-register call and response, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The sixth chorus returns to the initial structure, with the voice employing a \"growl\" technique. The tag features a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending, highlighting Ellington's mastery in using voices and instruments interchangeably.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a layer of tone color is a consistent stylistic trait in his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, he showcased his ability to blend tight orchestration with unique tone colors. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing exemplifies this, combining Miley's vocal elements with Cox's instrumental voice. Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) further illustrates this approach, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton’s muted trombone introduction of the melody.\n\nEllington’s legacy is defined by his ability to empower his band members while creating cohesive and innovative compositions, making him one of the most influential figures in jazz history.",
            "Well, I have this persistent feeling of lacking something. It's been with me since I was 14, entering my teenage life. And even now, at 17, it's still there. I thought I wanted a person more than anything else, but no one has caught my interest. Some boys have tried, but none of them have appealed to me. I often wonder what this peculiar situation is about. Over the past few years, I've tossed up several theories, but nothing concrete has stuck. So I continue to live my life, questioning my desires. A typical day at home is usually peaceful. My parents are both calm and get along well, even with me. We don't argue much, except when I try to assert my independence and vibrant personality. They're good people, and I think my lively nature makes me quite likeable. But today was different. As I wandered from room to room, looking for inspiration, I heard my mother scream from the kitchen. I rushed in and found her lying on the floor, obviously in pain. She told me to take her to the hospital. I carried her to the car and drove straight to the ER. The scent of disinfectant and sickness filled the air, but I was too focused on helping her. At the hospital, they took her to be examined. She had fallen while trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet.",
            "So this study was all about proving that sticking to a Mediterranean diet (Med diet), especially if you've got a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", is tied to a lower risk of getting chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, and even dying from a stroke. The aMed diet is basically a tweak on the Med diet, with more plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, along with more monounsaturated fats and fish, and less animal products and saturated fats. It's okay to have a bit of alcohol too.\n\nPreviously, studies showed that following the Med diet is linked to a lower risk of dying from heart disease or cardiovascular problems, and in a trial, it was better than a low-fat diet for losing weight and lowering \"bad\" cholesterol in people who are overweight. But no one had looked into stroke or stroke deaths.\n\nNow, this research followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 who didn't have heart disease or diabetes and were part of the Nurses' Health Study. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, they calculated an aMed diet score using food questionnaires. Over 95% of the nurses stayed in the study for the entire 20 years. These questionnaires were checked for accuracy. Reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, death certificates, or even autopsies. If records weren't available, cases were considered \"probable\" and included in the study.\n\nTo get a better idea of each person's long-term diet, the study used average aMed scores from the repeated questionnaires. They also adjusted for things that might mess up the results, like age, smoking, body weight, menopause, hormone use, vitamin intake, alcohol, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThey used something called Cox proportional-hazard modeling to see how an aMed score was linked to the risk of heart disease and stroke. In the end, they found that women who stuck to the Mediterranean diet the most (based on their aMed score) had a lower risk of getting heart disease and stroke. During the 20 years, they found 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from heart disease or stroke. Women who were in the top group for aMed score had a 29% lower risk for heart disease and stroke compared to those in the bottom group (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "So, fast forward to 2007. The good ol' US of A found itself in a real pickle - a financial crisis that was as crushing as it was unexpected. Joblessness skyrocketed, the housing market went belly up, and some of America's biggest fish in the corporate pond were left floundering. The thing is, how did we end up here, and how do we keep it from happening again?\n\nWell, let's rewind to the Clinton years, specifically 1999. The prez was eyeing a second term, and he figured the best way to boost his popularity was to relax lending restrictions. This move, combined with the pressure from shareholders, led to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac taking on a whole lot of sub-prime mortgages and repackaging them into CDOs and CDSs. When the borrowers couldn't make their loan payments, the banks found themselves in a right mess, and the consequences were felt throughout the economy.\n\nThere were plenty of factors that pushed the economy into a tailspin, one of which was the newfangled mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs were all the rage before the crisis, and they only made the economy more intertwined with the housing market. This left households and financial markets super vulnerable to even the smallest price changes.\n\nAs the housing bubble popped, the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities got a rude awakening. The top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which was about a third of the USA’s GDP. Things got so bad that Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch got sold off cheap, Lehman Brothers went kaput, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become regular old commercial banks with heavy regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in the red, and they ended up under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That section of your narrative where you attempt to flex your writer's wings and soar to new heights, or where your readers may fall asleep and abandon ship. Dr. Merlin has often found herself screaming at her monitor when she encounters too much information, none of which is in a fun way.\n\nExposition isn't your friend. Your readers already know the basics, like \"show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into lengthy passages where nothing happens, or where too much does. Exposition is the little demon sitting on your shoulder, whispering, \"Get the history out of the way to get to the good parts\" (though not to be confused with the other devil on your shoulder that wants to tell you every last detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition means sharing what happened with your audience, typically in straightforward prose. In film, it's when one character delivers a monologue of information, like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author is the one doing the telling.\n\nLet's consider an example. As you read a story, you learn that the heroine met her beloved at a certain place and time, got married in a grand style, and then witnessed her husband's murder. You wouldn't expect all of that to take up two pages, during which both characters only exchange a handful of lines. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, showing by his words and actions how deeply he loved his wife. You'd also expect the heroine to reveal through her actions and thoughts how much his presence changed her life. A thorough introduction to the husband's character would let you connect emotionally with his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her dreams and beliefs as seen through his eyes, and so on. You'd mourn his death with her, growing more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you'd expect substance, not just the bare bones of the story: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you must provide that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, continues*) Sometimes, it's tempting to rush through certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, and you know he used to be in the Air Force, now works nights at a gas station, was married twice, has no kids, enjoys fishing on weekends, dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nProvide the details.",
            "Well, let me tell you about the news from Columbus, Ohio. It's a bit grim, but here it goes. First off, there was a live broadcast on NBC 4 this morning, and the headline was about a guy named Shad Hostettler who had stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. They showed his mug shot, and he looked like pure evil. They spent only a couple of minutes on it, which I think was appropriate given that the story was still developing. The only details they gave were that he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I reckon they allocated a suitable amount of time to this news.\n\nNext up was a story about an 18-year-old, Travis Buyers, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, but no arrests had been made. The SWAT Team was looking into it. This story seemed quite brief, and I think that was probably because the victim was a black man, or from a black neighborhood. Now, I've noticed for years that minorities often get overlooked when they're crime victims. If it's a white person, the media goes crazy, but if it's a minority, it's lucky if it gets mentioned.\n\nFollowing that, the news covered a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. They mentioned the area where it might have happened and that the bullet was a .22 caliber from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers are offering five grand for tips leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThere was also a robbery story about a UDF on Clime Road. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. He was about six feet tall and weighed around 150 pounds. The news seemed to spend an unusual amount of time emphasizing his race.\n\nAnd finally, they reported on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was sentenced for conspiring to distribute marijuana in large quantities from Texas to Ohio. Instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years, they said \"300 months\". I'm not sure why that was, but they also mentioned he was Hispanic, which didn't seem particularly relevant to the story.",
            "There is a special tie between brothers, a bond so strong it can't be broken. This link carries with it a mix of feelings, like love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers understand each other in a way no one else can, and they often see themselves reflected in their sibling. It's in the direst of situations that this bond truly reveals itself, whether it's a force for good or ill. When these emotions surface, they come at a price. A part of understanding the feelings that stem from this fraternal bond is dealing with the fallout. When you look into your brother's eyes, you see not how others perceive you, but who you truly are. Your actions and their outcomes showcase your character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers grapple with this theme and the emotions that come with it. Amidst a lush, vividly described setting, these two boys embark on a doomed journey. The story reaches its climax with Doodle facing death from his older brother's disappointment and pride. The theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist and his interactions with Doodle, as well as the narrator's perspective, which highlights the complex emotions the protagonist feels and his view of the world around him.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single key emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their tragic last adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearns for a brother who can learn all his skills, like holding his breath underwater, running, or climbing, or even racing to Horsehead Landing. But Doodle is frail, born with a weak heart, making it unlikely he'd survive such activities. The young protagonist's dreams shatter when he realizes Doodle can't fulfill these expectations. He even entertains thoughts of suffocating Doodle with a pillow, showing his anger and frustration. Yet, Doodle's smile can melt his heart, giving him hope. This indicates that his conviction may not have been strong. Deep down, he cares for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and ingenious information-processing machine. As our technology has evolved from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. Keep in mind that these metaphors, while useful, have limitations and can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. This information is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when you see a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple aspects like color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are to determine that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the initial decisions made during bottom-up processing to speed up your recognition, like identifying it as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\n\nOnce information is processed to a certain extent, an attention filter decides its importance and which cognitive processes should access it. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name in a noisy room. There are numerous stages of processing, and the results are continually refined by attention.\n\nThe brain must store information before processing it. Memory types include sensory, working, and long-term. Information is first encoded, with specific types of encoding for each sensory stimulus. Verbal input, for instance, can be encoded structurally (what the word looks like), phonemically (what it sounds like), or semantically (what it means). Once stored, information must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for around 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained by the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are various models for how knowledge is organized in the brain, based on human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes a swipe at the looming threats of advanced technology and the capitalist system that supports it, painting a grim picture in Brave New World. The society values collective unity over individuality, with citizens brainwashed from birth to chase instant happiness. The populace is essentially puppets in a grand scheme, under the thumb of the World Controller, who dictates their every move. Looking at Brave New World through the lens of Marxism, one can't help but notice Huxley's reservations about these developments. Terms like homogenization and reification reinforce the idea that Huxley's novel is a critique of the flaws in society's economic structures of his time.\n\nCapitalism is openly mocked through the concept of false consciousness. Here, the common folk are blinded to the true nature of their economic standing, their interests solely driven by personal gain. This is the result of ideological control over the working class, which is clearly seen in the conditioning of Brave New World's citizens. The lower classes, like Delta and Gamma, lack their own will, with hypnopædia reinforcing a drive to consume and indulge, all manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where a dominant group controls others, is evident here, with the lower classes unknowingly buying into the very system that oppresses them. Upper classes, while aware of this manipulation, do little to resist it, much like the few Alphas or Betas, such as Bernard, who simply accept their place. The interactions between social classes further illustrate the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nThere's no room for genuine relationships in Brave New World. Characters, even major ones, are one-dimensional, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley suggests that the rise of technology and capitalism strips us of our free will and expression. Emotions are kept shallow, with men discussing women primarily based on their physical characteristics, and women openly talking about their encounters. The societal classes' contentment with their status indicates the socioeconomic impact of capitalism, reflecting Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely made to believe their superiority through their continued consumption and obedience.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for a couple of years now, which means I've spent a good chunk of my college life navigating the sprawling campus. During my freshman year, I was stuck in the East Halls dorms, which were tucked away in the far east corner of campus. Walking to classes scattered across campus, like the Willard building near the center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially when the weather was bad. I got the scoop from an alumni that not long ago, the campus was much bigger, with vast empty plots of land that have since been filled with sports fields and new buildings like the Creamery and health services facility. As the campus continues to grow, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. The solution? Cycling, of course. But bikes alone won't solve the problem. Students need to adopt them, and the campus must be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nI had a chat with a friend who recently picked up cycling after a long break. He marveled at how great bikes are and wondered why he had ever stopped. \"They’re the best way to get around,\" he said, \"especially when you're short on time and need to save energy.\" Biking doesn't just benefit your body; it's also the most efficient mode of transport. A simple bowl of oatmeal and a little exercise can take you 30 miles or more. Currently, I live off campus, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest move I made this year was buying a bike. Every day, I have classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my place, which cuts down to 5 minutes on a bike if I pedal fast. The only hiccup is that Pollock Road, the direct route to Thomas, isn't always easy to navigate, whether on bike or foot. Walking has its merits, but with my busy schedule, it's a luxury I can't afford. If I didn't have a bike, walking would be my only option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily commute. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add that to all the other time I'd spend walking to other classes, appointments, and so on—that’s more time than I can spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.

While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In my pursuit of an education in social work, I aim to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services, dedicated to assisting abused or neglected children and supporting troubled families. Core values that I bring to the social work field include service, respect, ethical integrity, and a commitment to improve relationships and continually enhance my professional competence. These values are not just vital for social workers; they are essential to my personal growth. I have always aspired to help others, but was uncertain of the right career path. During my high school and college years, I witnessed many individuals avoiding their problems in denial and using ineffective coping mechanisms. This influenced my decision to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break to reflect on my future. One summer day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. He was escaping his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police. I offered to help and drove to his parents’ house, where I spoke to the police and expressed my concerns. The police, seeing limited legal recourse, asked me to talk to the parents. When I questioned them about their son's “manipulative” behavior, they seemed nervous and made excuses. This experience led me to consider a career in social work to help children with family disputes.\n\nAnother crucial value in social work is social justice. Our society claims to value individuality yet often mourns lost individuals while striving to conform. I refuse to limit myself to societal norms. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively protested social injustice: dyeing my hair unnatural colors, wearing unique clothing, piercing my ears beyond traditional norms, declaring my involvement with GSBA, and fighting against racism and discrimination. I firmly believe in social justice and will continue to stand against injustice.",
            "The following paper delves into the Biological and Sociocultural models when it comes to the sleep disorder insomnia. The Biological model emphasizes inherited genetic factors and medical aspects, while the Sociocultural model explores environmental influences like race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models and presents research to explain and relate to them. Each study's findings and explanations are then critiqued for their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized into three main types: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders related to other mental disorders, and sleep disorders linked to medical conditions or substance intake. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias involve issues with initiating or maintaining sleep, such as Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, and Narcolepsy. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are characterized by abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep, like Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder. Sleep disorders linked to other mental disorders are related to Axis I or Axis II disorders.\n\nThe paper primarily focuses on insomnia and touches on primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models. The Biological model identifies genetic and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. For instance, neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice found that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep/wake states. Activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition causes reduced anxiety and sleep induction. The use of GABAB agonists like baclofen increased sleep time in the study, suggesting that mice and humans share similar genetic and environmental factors affecting sleep. This suggests that a malfunction in these receptors could impair sleep quality without medication. Socioculturally, this could mean that inherited traits influence sleep, and any alteration in these receptors could disrupt sleep and negatively impact daily life tasks.",
            "Alright, let me break this down into three main points. First off, we gotta understand what's up with Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short. It's basically the brain's ability to process what we hear, and when that doesn't work right, you've got CAPD. You can hear alright, but your brain's just not translating it as it should.\n\nNow, this disorder's been around since the mid-50s, back when it was called \"auditory imperception\". The Italians were the ones who started evaluating kids with comms disorders, and Kimura came up with that dichotic testing stuff. And in 1977, a big conference got everyone talking about CAPD, which led to more research.\n\nCAPD can show up in a bunch of ways. You might have trouble figuring out where sounds are coming from, or you might struggle to tell two sounds apart. Maybe you can't pick up on patterns or changes in speech, like detecting sarcasm. Or, you might have trouble hearing one sound over another. And sometimes, you just can't make sense of what you hear, or follow the order of what's being said.\n\nTo diagnose it, you need to look at how someone listens and performs on tests. This can be done by audiologists, speech therapists, psychologists, and others. There's no one-size-fits-all test, and the cause is still unknown. Some tests might play multiple sounds at once and ask you to pick out certain ones. Others might record sounds in your ear and measure your responses.",
            "Twelfth Night seems to say that although masquerade is in fact a useful tool for carrying out prolonged deceptions, in the end, a person must shed that newly adopted persona, or else risk losing oneself. The challenge of ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves estranged as a result. Therefore, one must ultimately choose between one’s own self-preservation or preserving relationships with those around them. Although some may accept the deception with neutrality, others may take it quite seriously and be offended by the charade.\n\nThe issue of deception in gender role reversal is particularly troublesome, as it raises numerous side questions, with the most crucial one being why? Why does the subject feel the need to discard their own identity and take on the guise of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it is clearly a form of self-defense: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) Having newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels compelled to pretend to be a man to safeguard herself from potential assailants. Her plan works, but it also isolates her from the women around her, cutting her off from a vital support network. To make matters worse, she is so convincing in her disguise that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) She also has to grapple with suppressed romantic feelings between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261)\n\nWhile this could be seen as a progressive stance, to a modern reader, Twelfth Night may serve as an example of how deception can help uncover repressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Some passages suggest that these characters may harbor unexpressed subconscious desires that the presence of Viola/Cesario forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because he appears to be a man, or does she secretly have feelings for women? One might argue that this is not the case, as Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems to be more likely to judge others based solely on their appearance.\n\nThis is evident by the ease with which Olivia shifts her romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to view Cesario/Viola as a family member rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "Another month has passed. Life's been pretty much the same, nothing much happening. But let me fill you in on what did occur. I finally completed the beta version of the tradenet website, after a lot of procrastination, I'll admit. Probably gonna register the domain and launch the site around the middle of January. The delay was due to a lack of funds and a means to transfer it to the web host. My partner's getting his credit card in January, so that's when we'll set it up. I also flunked accounting. I guess I knew it was coming, but it still stings. I scored a 47 out of 100. I put in an appeal, not expecting much, but at least there's hope. I did get distinctions for law and economics, though. I suppose if you like a course, you're more motivated to do well in it. But if it's easy to understand, you're more likely to like it. So it's a catch-22 situation. I'll find out the appeal result this week, fingers crossed.\n\nNot much else has happened, so that's all for now. Until next time.\n\nSo, I've been dealing with this affliction called shyness. Talking to strangers, especially the opposite sex, turns me into jelly. I can't think, start trembling, and freeze up. It happened today at the YEN meeting. Couldn't even tell Genevieve that I hadn't received the club mailing list invitation. I'm working on this, though. That's one of the reasons I joined YEN - to force myself into situations that make me interact with strangers, especially those from the opposite gender. I won't get anywhere in life if I can't do this. It's so frustrating to want something so bad but be too afraid to reach out and grab it. I WILL overcome this disability. The only way is through increased interaction.\n\nAnother problem I'm dealing with is negative thinking, which affects my motivation. I don't want to sound cliché, but it's true. It's mostly my mom's fault. She's so negative all the time, and it's rubbed off on me. I'm working on changing this, though. I talked to a YEN guy I met through Darren, a total 'Adam Knoo' convert. He made me realize how negative my thoughts have been lately. I'm going to stop using the word 'try' and use 'MUST' instead. It makes a huge difference. I MUST come up with a study and work schedule this Sunday and STICK to it.\n\nWell, Kings got himself a girlfriend. Wouldn't have thought that would happen anytime soon. Shows how life can surprise you. I don't blame him, but the reasons for their relationship are a bit suspect. I'm not sure if he's really into her or if he's just trying to prove something to himself. I hope he's happy, though.\n\nI've been lazy about updating my blog for a while, but I'm back now. School holidays are here, and I hope I passed all my papers. I'm heading down to the registry of companies today to register a business partnership with Kumar. I'm calling it 'Epac Trading Company' in honor of our earlier partnership plans. I'm also working on tradenet, which I loathe, but I promised I'd do it.\n\nI just read an article about Bill Cosby's remarks on the culture of victimism in America. It made me think about the culture of victimism in the civilized world today. I get tired of people blaming everything but themselves for their troubles. Unless you're mentally incapacitated, you're responsible for your life. What's the point of blaming everything? Why not take action? I'm trying to do that by setting specific life goals and being disciplined about working towards them. You can't go anywhere if you don't have a clear goal.\n\nI slept at 10 last night, something I haven't done in ages. I must study economics tomorrow, MUST. Saying 'will' is not enough, I need to say 'MUST'. I MUST complete the first three topics tomorrow. I know it's ambitious, considering my procrastinating past, but I MUST do it. I'm answering to myself, and lying to myself is far worse than lying to anyone else.\n\nIt's been a week and a half since the last semester ended. The holidays flew by. This is probably the last holiday I'll have to laze around and do nothing. The next one, at the end of this year, will be busy with the DPP project and starting up the tuition center. The following one, in mid-2005, I'll be in Melbourne at RMIT for most of that month. I look forward to earning my keep, but I don't want to leave the security of school so soon. But time marches on, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. I just hope life doesn't chew me up and spit me out. But that's just being pessimistic. Remember, the glass is half full!\n\nI was just in a contemplative mood, thinking about how it's sad that good friends can grow apart as you grow up. You gain new perspectives, and those might not align with your friends. Sometimes it's due to differing views or circumstances. Some things are out of your control, but most aren't. It's a choice we all have to make. I've had many good people in my life. It's sad to reminisce about the good times, but I don't want to hold them back from shaping me into the person I am today or the person I'll be tomorrow. The choices we make.",
            "The classification of popular music has expanded over the last 100 years to encompass a vast array of genres, making it challenging to list them all. This is further complicated by the fact that most genres, from rap to country, and jazz to folk, have spawned numerous sub and sub-sub genres. Heavy Metal rock, particularly, has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in popular music over the past 40 years. It's expressive because it conveys a wide range of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker side of the spectrum. It's also diverse as individuals quickly recognized its flexibility, leading to the creation of their own sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a chain that continues to this day.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement has evolved to the point where it's hard to define what exactly heavy metal is. It has absorbed themes from various other genres but, like everything else, it originated from somewhere. To truly understand the metal music prevalent today, one must first comprehend what the metal movement is and why it's considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement shaped by darkness. It can be seen as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. There's less primitivism and more technical skill; metal bands truly know how to play their instruments, and it's evident in their music. Metal is also, notably, a drug-induced movement. The mid-70s psychedelic drug boom led to artists creating wild, otherworldly records, using drugs as a catalyst for their creation. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which was new to the music scene as much of popular music didn't delve into the darker emotional spectrum. Later generations of metal artists also took inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like the following exemplify this:",
            "A few decades before the Surrealists began painting their dreamlike works, Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own dreams in both literal and figurative ways. The Dream, a painting from 1910 by the renowned Post-Impressionist, depicts not just a woman in awe of the wonders she experiences in a dream, but also Rousseau’s own dreams and aspirations as an artist. Ever since he started his journey, he longed for recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art lovers, only to confront a challenging internal conflict: to either imitate existing styles to gain acceptance or to forge his own unique path. The Dream encapsulates Rousseau’s lifelong struggle with this dilemma.\n\nTo truly understand The Dream, we must first delve into Rousseau’s life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France, his father was a prosperous tinsmith and hardware dealer. He grew up without formal art training and worked as a gabelou for France until the age of forty, erroneously known as a douanier, or customs inspector. After the loss of his first wife and eight children, Rousseau turned to painting for solace and new beginnings. Unlike many of his contemporaries, who romanticized the peasant in their paintings, Rousseau was a folk artist, reflecting the aspirations and dreams of the common class.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance by the art world is understandable given his background: he was uneducated in formal painting and began his career later in life, working alongside more established and recognized artists. It was not until around the same time that Matisse was building his reputation that Rousseau started to gain recognition for his art. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, “Matisse was a painter who feared painting in a conventional way, while Rousseau strove to paint in a conventional manner to be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Another thing that's captured my attention is the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics that many great thinkers have explored. It's not just about education or experience, but something more profound. As John Keats put it in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Ethics and aesthetics seem to talk to each other without us even realizing it. We often study art and morals to understand why something is beautiful or right, rather than to prescribe specific rules for beauty or morality. Even when we try to describe what makes a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa great, we often find ourselves saying, \"There's just something about it\" before diving into a more complex explanation. This is because art and morals can't be fully captured by description alone. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Both art and morals have this transcendent quality, this ineffable \"something\" that makes them so powerful. This \"something\" is what connects ethics and aesthetics. I believe this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics is the reason they feel so deeply impactful, especially when it comes to literature. As McKean argues, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts... is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany in its present form is a powerful, united country, with a rich cultural tapestry that weaves through its landscape, from the scenic Alps in München to the Baltic Sea coastal city of Kiel. This unique blend of culture is evident whether you are in Köln by the Rhine, the heart of Germany, or the historical city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given the diverse origins of its inhabitants, it's not surprising that Germany, as we know it today, is a fusion of various tribes and influences.\n\nThe origins of the name \"Germania\" are shrouded in historical debate. Some scholars claim it comes from the Germanic tribe known as Tungrians, who were once called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, first used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others suggest the name is derived from the German spear, known as a \"ger\" (O.E.D., 2010), or from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" implying the Germans were loud or warlike (Names of Germany).\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" described the Germans as \"aboriginal\" and not mixed with other races through immigration. He questioned why anyone would leave the warm climates of Asia or Africa for the harsher lands of Germany, with its wild terrain, harsh weather, and stern demeanor (Tacitus, 98). The Romans, while they often raided German lands for resources, generally preferred to return to their own empire rather than settle in Germania (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).\n\nAs the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the outskirts of the Roman Empire. They traded their land-grown goods and served in the Roman army, integrating their skills and culture into the Roman fold (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I looked down at the view in front of me, my mind as blank as the scene itself. Silently, unemotionally, with a practiced eye that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding, I analyzed the picture. Thoughts flowed in and out like a gentle stream. It was as if I had no thoughts of my own, just an active and fluid experience of what I was seeing. Once, an artist I worked with suggested I get a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had always wanted to learn to draw, and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to the brain's processes for interpreting lines. One technique it teaches is to place a square frame around any picture to simplify it. At that moment, standing there, I couldn't mentally project that frame. I was too overwhelmed, too awed. I felt like I was at the beginning of my own artistic journey, starting my own story. Fingertips lightly touched my chosen art tool, muscles tensed and relaxed as I began to recreate the scene in my mind. Water swirled smoothly, crystals clear and clean. A flurry of matter broke away, carried away to nothingness. My hand smacked the handle again, the brown package still stubbornly in place. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet thought, and then I gripped the toilet paper like a gloved hand. I stood up, then bent at the waist, and slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, like a mother retrieving a Thanksgiving turkey from the oven...",
            "Another grim trend has emerged among our youth, one that's been claiming lives behind the wheel. Several elements converge to create this deadly pattern for our youngest drivers. The National Institutes of Health highlight that the teen brain is simply not equipped to handle the perils of driving, and this lack of experience leads to more fatal accidents, as well as a higher rate of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. But the hazards don't stop there—teens are even more vulnerable when driving with their friends, a fact that anyone with an inkling of common sense understands. Studies have shown that the presence of passengers, especially teens, significantly increases the risk of accidents. California and other states have implemented measures like temporary provisional licenses, limiting driving hours and passengers, but these are merely Band-Aids. The core issue is that, collectively, our youngest drivers aren't ready to handle the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman even suggests that 18 is too young for a standard driver's license, citing research that shows teens under 19-20 often seek out thrills and risks. Therefore, delaying driving until this tendency subsides could help reduce accidents and save lives. By 2010, the first wave of Baby Boomer's children will be eligible to drive, potentially adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads. A sensible solution is to continue driver's education classes in schools, but no one under 18 should be allowed to drive a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued, with a set number of practical driving hours required, mirroring existing state requirements. Uniform, national legislation could help protect teens across the country. This approach is not a new idea.",
            "After sifting through the Library of Congress’s treasure trove of early Edison films, I made it my mission to watch all the trick films from 1895 to 1901, numbering fifteen in total. These films are known for their clever use of editing to create illusions. My study primarily focused on describing the poetic elements of the bulk of these trick films and exploring the unique qualities of a few of the latter films. Most trick films from this era adhere to a set-bound style, confined within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, and utilizing long and medium shots. They stick to the one shot equals one film method. However, some films at the dawn of the twentieth century were bold enough to break these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common thread among these trick films is their use of an interior set confined within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationery, not moving to follow figures or objects. This style finds its roots in the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. The constraint of the stage means that figures in trick films usually move side-to-side, never walking towards or away from the camera. A clear example is the action in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). Actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, but the camera never follows them out of the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also dictates that shots are typically long and occasionally medium shots. Close-ups are absent from all the trick films in the Edison catalog. This is a nod to the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where audiences saw the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. As in most early films, actors don’t move towards the camera, so close-ups are non-existent.\n\nMost early trick films follow the rule that one conceptual shot equates to one film. This caps the length at about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. It also limits the dramatic or narrative scope of the films; most focus on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. However, in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes doesn’t correspond to a physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be composed of several joined together to create illusions of apparition or disappearing. Examine The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A closer look reveals that the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "So John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republicanism. Though primarily an agriculturalist, his career in politics greatly influenced his dedication and vocal support for personal freedom and government. His commitment to an agrarian system shaped his views on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the United States as a unique opportunity to create an ideal system, unhampered by traditional constraints, allowing for self-government. He firmly believed in the natural rights of man, asserting their interdependence—if one is denied, the rest fail, and their remaining value diminishes. These rights should remain beyond government reach. He argued that the \"state of nature\" allowed the powerful and malevolent to thrive, but civilization must prevent this.\n\nTo establish an ideal society, Taylor believed a government should account for human goodness and evil. He was rigid in his dualistic morality, claiming, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). Good principles, like protecting private property and agriculture, and discouraging capitalism, were fundamental. A government founded on these principles would function fairly despite its administration's self-interest.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans of his time, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution. He wanted a minimal Federal Government, with no rights or powers beyond those explicitly stated. He recognized potential corruption in a literal interpretation without considering the writers' intent. He considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter, as it described the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Alright, so let's revisit Figure 17. A major dip in commuter log submissions happened in the third month of our project. That was a bit of a bummer, and the reason behind it? Well, it's a bit unclear. The New England winter might've been the culprit, with fewer folks commuting by bike or on foot. Plus, December is the end of the semester, leaving many with schoolwork and grades on their minds, possibly causing the log to slip their radar. On top of that, the holiday season brings a month-long break for students and faculty, with many not needing to come to campus at all. Classes resume in late January, which could explain the low February log submissions. But what about the February dip? It could just be a natural ebb and flow of excitement with any new project. To combat this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which did bring back some of our log submissions. So, we faced the challenge of keeping the momentum going despite holiday breaks and a decline in natural excitement. Another big issue for this or any similar project is the deep cultural love for the freedom and flexibility of driving. To counter this, we offered various prizes like gift cards to local places. It'd be awesome to see if bigger prizes like a bicycle, hybrid, or electric car would've boosted participation. The value of the prizes didn't change throughout the project, but announcing bigger prizes later might've helped. The gift cards were great at the start, but adding some bicycles and cars as bigger prizes could've been a game-changer.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of investment that is designed to mimic the performance of an index, a commodity, or a group of assets, similar to an index fund. However, unlike index funds, ETFs trade like stocks on an exchange. This setup offers several advantages: the diversification of an index fund, the flexibility of selling short, buying on margin, and the ability to purchase as few as one share at a time. While these benefits are enticing, it's important to note that ETFs come with a downside—the need to pay a commission on trades, much like stock orders. Additionally, ETFs offer a wide range of funds to choose from. However, as a savvy investor, it's crucial to assess whether the stated advantages, such as diversification, genuinely exist and to what extent they do so.\n\nFor this analysis, let's examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of its total assets. The top holdings and their respective percentages are as follows:\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we can calculate the contribution of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio were composed entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions that the ETF has established. The Beta and Return calculations for each stock are shown in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it's clear that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, a 16% increase. Moreover, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 points lower than the ETF's overall Beta. These initial results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower risk, but it's essential to determine if these portfolios are statistically different from one another.\n\nTo assess this, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is often regarded as one of his superior works. Within it, he employs the term \"Thulé,\" which Mabbott attributes to Virgil. Virgil referred to an island north of Britain, marking the edge of the known world. While Virgil indeed used the term, a more recent and significant influence should be recognized. Poe was deeply interested in German literature, particularly the works of Goethe.\n\nThis knowledge is significant because it reveals Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" notes the similarities between the two poets' works, suggesting that Poe was inspired by Goethe. Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of poetic drama, including his magnum opus \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his death. Within \"Faust,\" Part II contains a short poem titled \"The King of Thule,\" which tells of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. Overwhelmed by sorrow, he drinks heavily and cries, then decides to end his life by throwing the goblet into the sea. His actions and the description of the king in \"Dream-Land\" bear a striking resemblance, hinting at a dark reflection of Poe's own experiences.\n\nPoe references \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but in \"Dream-Land,\" he uses the term as a framing device. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a dark, lonely landscape where he is haunted by deceased friends, which mirrors the feelings of the king in \"The King of Thule.\" Both poems depict a world without color and life, suggesting that the speaker has stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was an influential author, and Poe would have been exposed to his work through various reproductions and his admiration for Tennyson, whom Poe greatly respected. When asked if he admired Tennyson, Poe's response underscored his familiarity with German literature and the works of Goethe.",
            "Alright, another thing I'd like to talk about is this legal conundrum. Could a customer injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice? Well, under California law, it's not a clear-cut case. To prove punitive damages, the plaintiff needs to show that the defendant's actions were intentional and that they were committed with a willful disregard for the probable harm that would result. In Jennifer Palmer's case, she fell on an applesauce spill that was reported twice to the manager, Paul Martin, but he failed to clean it up because he was eating dinner. Six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the store before Palmer's accident, so it's reasonable for her to argue that Martin should have known the risk and still failed to act. However, proving that Martin's actions were despicable might be more challenging. But given the circumstances, her claim is not without merit.",
            "Four years ago, I took a course on Islam at CBC where a significant topic of debate was whether Islam is inherently hostile. This discussion remains pertinent today. Since 9/11, I've witnessed a shift in media portrayal, from hostility towards both Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance toward Islam in America. In 2001, it would've been unthinkable to imagine a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who has a Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe life story of Muhammad, as presented in the biography, is intriguing but seems to contradict historical accounts. From what I know, Muhammad was depicted as a forceful figure who conquered tribes and coerced them into adopting Islam. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble, who attracted followers through his teachings and miracles. This portrayal seems designed to present him as a humble prophet who needed no proof but was centered around truth and miracles. This approach trivializes the life and miracles of Jesus, as if Muhammad is being used to take credit for Jesus' life and personhood.\n\nAdditionally, many stories in the biography suggest an agenda to provide evidence of voluntary conversions. However, these accounts often come from third-party sources, which I find suspicious. For instance, the author might claim to have heard from someone who heard it from someone else, weakening the credibility of the stories.\n\nWhat bothers me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man. Historical records suggest otherwise, and I can't help but wonder if current Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "So, the lessons Jesus taught and his beliefs during his life have been left behind in the evolution of Christian thought, which has since moved on from its roots after his life. If we look at the broader picture, we see that Christianity has strayed further and further from its origin over time. Today's world shows an increasing awareness and unprecedented progressiveness. While traditional people and thinkers still exist and might resist any new ideas, they may not have the influence to shape the whole. Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a growing desire to distinguish the doctrines that have been added to Christianity over time from the original intent of the religion's founder. It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable: a reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a movement that removes layers of doctrine, one by one, as if the clock is turning back, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God remains, before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend spreads through the United States and Europe, influencing masses to worship as if they were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of every kind, we will see increasing similarities instead of differences. Human history is filled with great reversions. An example is how Christians once were persecuted, shunned, and killed by the Roman Empire, but later that empire became a Christian institution. Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process. It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus' words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements. So, what happened after Jesus' lifetime?\n\nLooking far back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were all at the core of the religion even as the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not united. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "Oh, so The Jungle, it's all about how humans, deep down, are greedy and self-centred, huh? They're all about making their own lives as cushy as possible, never mind who gets stepped on along the way. Sinclair makes it crystal clear with his descriptions of the factory owners and managers. They're just after big, fat profits, not caring a whit about anyone or anything in their path, including the pollution they spew out. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" he writes. They couldn't care less about the smoke, the animal waste, or even the people they're exploiting.\n\nAnd the workers? Well, they're just tools for these greedy folks to make money with. They'll do anything to squeeze out an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". Workers are forced to work in appalling conditions, with no job security and no safety net. Back then, there were barely any laws protecting workers' rights, so managers could run amok, pushing workers to the breaking point. And if you can't handle it, well, tough luck. There were no unions to help, just more people looking to make a buck off the workers' misery. It was a system of slavery, plain and simple, with workers \"dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors have their own methods to evoke certain feelings or ideas in their readers, with some techniques proving more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs a variety of these methods in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he combines an adjective and a noun in an unusual way to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. Other times, he imbues a symbol with meaning and then uses it to convey that same meaning. Fitzgerald frequently uses this latter technique with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel, he attributes specific meanings to white/gray and red/pink before later employing those meanings to evoke feelings around important objects.\n\nFitzgerald associates white/gray with uniformity, with white being slightly more elegant and refined, and gray representing something older and worn. He establishes this connection at the beginning of the novel by repeatedly using both colors. Daisy and Jordan are continually “in white” (8), and everyone else is dressed in white as well: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears a “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). The only exceptions are when Nick is observing Gatsby’s party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). He also uses these colors to describe ordinary objects and people: the “names” at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray” (61) on Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—uniformity (28). He uses white/gray to describe ordinary or common people and places, such as Daisy and Jordan having a “white girlhood” (19), the “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\n\nAfter building up these meanings, Fitzgerald employs them to signify unimportance or uniformity for certain subjects. This use of colors to convey meaning starts with Daisy. After a prolonged period without significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster,” causing readers to perceive her as less of a character and more like a uniform object that Gatsby desires and longs for (74). He continues this technique around Daisy to emphasize her uniformity, for example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",
            "San Diego County is pretty much a powerhouse when it comes to agriculture, with its mild and sunny climate. The area's main crops include tomatoes, lemons, peaches, berries, honey, and a variety of leafy greens, squash, broccoli, and peppers. There's a pretty solid demand in the area for organic, community-supported agriculture, with many local groups having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also quite popular. Many organic farms here offer tours of their operations and access for activities like hiking and birdwatching, which can help the landowner make some extra cash or provide educational experiences. This kind of setup would let the landowner benefit from government programs while also improving habitat, providing recreational activities, and creating opportunities for farm tours and other programs.",
            "So, culture, it's a big deal in any negotiation. It's not something you can define with one word or one stereotype. It's like saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" right? That's way too broad and simple. Instead, it's better to understand how a culture affects the conversation at hand and how it plays into the negotiation. When you're dealing with a foreign culture, you'll compare it to your own, and that's normal. But it's important not to judge or change a culture, but to work within it, especially if you're at a disadvantage.\n\nUnderstanding a culture can mean looking into its past or seeing its prejudices. You don't have to agree with them or try to change them, just accept them for what they are. And when you're in a foreign environment, respect can go a long way in breaking down cultural barriers and moving the negotiation forward.\n\nCulture isn't just about national boundaries. Companies also have their own cultures. Some might value long work hours, others a relaxed schedule. You can see a company's culture in how employees dress, how they communicate, and how they hire. Even within the same country, there's a lot of diversity. For example, American companies can have very different cultures. Some might encourage employee philanthropy, others might restrict it. The point is, a lot of thought goes into the culture of a society or a company.\n\nValues are key too, because they tell you why a culture is the way it is. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, you won't publicly shame anyone at the negotiation table. And if a culture values a hard-driven bargain, you won't settle too quickly. Understanding these generalities before you start negotiating can really help. But it's also important to learn about your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation effective.",
            "So, as it stands, let's assume that both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas are onto something with their beliefs in the existence of the God of the Bible. After all, they're both arguing for the same thing, so we'll start with that premise. However, I'm not convinced that either of them really gives a solid foundation for believing in God. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at St. Anselm's argument. He's all about finding God within ourselves, using our own understanding to prove his existence. He says that because God is within our comprehension, we can't really grasp his nonexistence. It's a bit convoluted, but the gist is that we don't need external evidence to know God is real; we just need to look inside ourselves. This is essentially faith, as it's accepting something without irrefutable proof.\n\nNow, contrast that with Thomas Aquinas. He's all about reason and empirical evidence. He believes we can prove God's existence using logic, without any faith. This is super handy for conversions, as we can convince people with reasoning alone. He's got five arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He shows that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for his existence.\n\nSo, while they both have valid points, I think neither really gives a complete picture for believing in God.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future Buddha was born. Over his lifetime, he gave up the world, attained enlightenment, and his teachings became Buddhism, specifically Theravada Buddhism, which has existed for around twenty-five hundred years. The religion, from its customs to its core beliefs, has evolved since Buddha's time. For instance, in Sri Lanka, a Theravada nation, an annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated, a practice Buddha never taught. Differences extend from superficial traditions to the religion's essence. Both monastic and lay communities have had to adjust their doctrines over time due to external and internal influences, both friendly and hostile.\n\nThis discussion will frequently use terms like internal and external forces. Internal forces come from Buddhists, regardless of their status, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces harm or aim to harm the Buddhist community, born of a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces, while not intentionally helping or harming, may do so as a result.\n\nLet's start by understanding the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. The Dhamma, composed of the Tripitaka—three baskets of Buddhist texts—includes the Sutta Pitaka (Suttas), Vinaya Pitaka (disciplinary rules), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical components like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering, and Anicca—impermanence of all things). Recognizing these concepts helps end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and cease lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, upon enlightenment.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for life. Laypeople follow five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances), while monks follow many more rules. The four noble truths form the fundamental doctrine: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The height of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States defeated Mexico and gained new territories like Texas and the American Southwest (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). Apart from this war, there were numerous other skirmishes between the two nations that finally subsided just before World War I.\n\nThis scenario is not unique to the U.S. and Mexico; many nations that share a border often have disputes due to shared interests. David M. Pletcher (1977) points out that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41), stressing the closeness of these nations to the U.S. and their historic rivalries, unlike other Latin American nations which have typically enjoyed good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious issues were a significant factor in the rivalry between the U.S. and Mexico, much like the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). The enduring distrust between the U.S. and Mexico can be traced back to the historical tension between the English and Spanish, which carried over into their colonial legacies.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during their 57-year rivalry, with most of these disputes being territorial issues related to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a persistent problem until both nations exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to wane as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and ended as American ambitions shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century.",
            "Fifteen‭ ‬years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly struck down by an illness that I had never known existed. I was a nurse at the time, having chosen my profession out of a deep-seated need for the safety and security that eluded me as a child. The mantra I heard as I grew older was, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" So, even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist—preferably a bit of both—I chose nursing.\n\nYet there I was: 46‭ ‬years old, single, with no money to speak of, and unable to work. To this day, I am disabled, and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability, I have absolutely nothing left that I can call my own. I manage to get by, but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, yet there's one thing I know to be true—I could not have made it through these years without the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. And believe me, when real disaster strikes, you do not feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life—big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well one prepares, some things are just too big to overcome on one's own.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that we in the U.S. need to stop relying so heavily on big government. Lord knows it's crumbling. Yet, I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again—learning to help each other and to ask for help—rather than each of us individually scrambling to build fallout shelters in our backyards.\n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country, but in truth, what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism, it was compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit—first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and plastic sheeting for the windows in case of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and batteries, candle and waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food—do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "So, why do organisms evolve the way they do? Are there limits or constraints that guide evolutionary change? While in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson stated that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" the same can still be said today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny, for example, as seen in Raup and Stanley's work from 1981. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help understand the mechanisms behind the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to define quantitative parameters that could be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that extends through 360 degrees of space over time. These turns or revolutions of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis called the columella. The columella runs through the central column of the shell. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, known as a suture. The largest whorl of a shell is typically the last one, called the body whorl, with the spire being all the whorls except the last one. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is the base. The animal exits its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture pointing toward the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical view and determine where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts, then count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures traveling through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced via the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is made, parameters can be varied and modified to alter the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "Well, another decade has passed, and Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates haven't moved an inch. While the country's on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, like water and sanitation, the progress in child and maternal health has been dismally slow, falling short of the target. Let's delve into the reasons behind these shortcomings and the urgent need to bolster the overall health system rather than just focusing on specific programs.\n\nLooking at the numbers, it's clear that Indonesia's progress in having skilled birth attendants is somewhat misleading. While 72% of births now have a skilled worker present, traditional midwives can't provide medical interventions, leading to a high maternal death rate from hemorrhage. Additionally, there's a decline in treating diarrheal cases in children under five. Postnatal care data is also incomplete, but it's evident that this area needs attention, with low rates across the country. Cesarian-section rates are still low, at 4%, but there's a worrying discrepancy between urban and rural areas, with a 5% rate in cities and only 2% in rural settings. This inequity in access to healthcare is clear, as is the stark difference in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, with a 27% gap.\n\nWhen considering next steps for improving neonatal and maternal care, a crucial question is how to tackle the service gap effectively. Should Indonesia focus on program-specific approaches or strengthen the health system as a whole? Programmatic approaches are attractive because they offer targeted, manageable goals and quicker results. However, investing heavily in one area can lead to funding shortages and human resource migration to better-resourced sectors. Plus, running multiple parallel programs can cause duplications and uncoordinated services, resulting in increased paperwork.\n\nSo, there's a need to balance these approaches and consider both.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocracy. Two notable exceptions to this norm are 'Oliver Twist' and 'Wuthering Heights'. These works add an element of mystery and a hint of the unusual, which helps to deepen the characters within each story, providing insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“And now, a multitude of bewildering and confusing thoughts rushed into his mind. It seemed as if he was still walking between Sikes and Crackit, arguing fiercely. The very words they spoke echoed in his ears, and he realized that he was actually talking to them. Suddenly, he recoiled at the sound of gunshots. Shouts and screams filled his ears, and lights flashed before his eyes, everything was chaos and commotion, as an unseen force carried him away quickly. Throughout these vivid visions, a constant, vague sense of pain gnawed at him, tormenting him endlessly.\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often use dream sequences or dreamlike states to incorporate this mystery. In 'Oliver Twist', these strange occurrences reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, his pains, and his awareness of the true nature of the events happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, it happens as if in a dream, as he struggles to find help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events, as well as the dire state his health had reached, as seen through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overpowers him, numbing his senses, and he doesn't notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away. He re-experiences his despair again, removed from the initial shock of pain, now linked with constant fear. The question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, as it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything, even while his life is in danger. A sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied, suggesting that old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed – or did it? There was no day; it was gone as soon as it began – and night came on again; a night that was endless yet fleeting, long in its dreadful silence and brief in its hurried hours.",
            "A couple of years back, I was working in an after-school program, tutoring younger kids. I did my best to assist them in their studies, but my strongest subjects were English and reading. I was asked by one of the instructors to help a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. He was in third or fourth grade and spoke perfect English, which made his reading difficulties particularly puzzling. At first, I thought Adrian had some peculiar problems. He could pronounce some letters correctly, but others, not at all. It was strange. He was of Latino descent, and I knew his mother only spoke Spanish. When she came to pick him up, I realized his issue was not with reading but with knowing the English alphabet. I don't know if that revelation helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier problem in schools, especially in California. It's often not as clear-cut as we think, even for a child who speaks perfect English. Reading can still be a real challenge. This issue is acknowledged, but what can we do about it? In Adrian's case, the solution was simple: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for many children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer. Combining dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, or any of these methods alone won't fix the problem. The key is to combine all these approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a fantastic idea, not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all children. Studies have shown that children in these programs outperform their peers academically. This idea is often feared as a waste of resources, but that's not accurate. If implemented widely, all children would benefit. How, though? Should we make all teachers bilingual? No, that's unreasonable. However, having bilingual aides or tutors available would be a practical solution.",
            "Since childhood, many of us are told about a force greater than ourselves, something we can't fully understand. Some learn about it at Sunday school, others at the Temple, or delve within themselves for answers. Often, we follow the religions passed down by our parents, but some reject them outright, denying any existence beyond our personal, egocentric worlds. Our values and belief systems may shift over time, but our spiritual journeys are uniquely ours. We search for light to guide us out of the darkness. \"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked him about his favorite bird. We sat on our porch, listening to the rain, our cigarettes offering a brief respite from the tension. He looked out into the storm, his gaze both searching and remembering. His body was gaunt, his hair sparse. I couldn't bring myself to talk about his passing, afraid it would make the reality more tangible. I hugged him, repositioned my chair, and stared into the falling rain together.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just days after I turned twenty-two. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering but not eased it. I couldn't watch my father's life end. I wanted to remember him as he lived, not die. I hid in my bed for three days, waiting for news. No one called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is essentially an \"oxymoronic fusion of 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt points out in his book The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both reviled and lauded, accused of being shallow, and praised for its 'terrible sublime' effect (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined elements of both \"ancient and modern\" romances to birth the proto-Gothic genre and a novel way of literary expression. Walpole utilizes \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily on throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary advancements. This combination of more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing readers a deeper insight into character psychology) is what keeps Gothic literature enduring and both obsolete and fresh to readers from different times.\n\nOne of the most distinctive Gothic themes is the notion of Chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is particularly significant to Gothic writers because it represents the ideal knight—brave, honorable, and competent—and the perceived lack of these qualities in contemporary society. Through the use of chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized, hinting at the evolution of Gothic to Romantic literature, and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole, who wrote The Castle of Otranto during a politically troubled time and was despairing over the future, may have felt that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" of the gothic era had been lost in the individuals of 'present' society. This concept is evident in several characters, such as Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits. The reader learns that Frederic is a prince, has suffered tragedy, and is now believed to be killed by infidels, embodying the figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" (66).",
            "So, supply chain management is all about the flow of goods from a customer's order to raw materials, through production, distribution, and finally, the customer. The term was coined in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. He saw it as the planning, implementation, and control of the entire process to meet customer needs swiftly and efficiently. Now, there are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the tools business managers use to deliver top-notch customer service. Let's break it down:\n\nProduction is the first step in the chain. It's the backbone, outlining when, why, where, and how things get made. Managers need to know what customers want, so they look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator of what customers demand. Once they've analyzed it, they decide what to produce and how much. Then comes the location – where and which plant will be best for volume and quality, keeping the customer in mind. After that, it's about scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Production is crucial, every detail matters. For instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target. Both had detailed processes for everything from uniforms to receiving shipments. These processes help keep things running smoothly with clear direction and expectations.\n\nThe second key element is supply. This is about making strategic decisions to determine a facility's core capabilities and decide on outsourcing partnerships. A company might have several divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers decide which division is best for each process. They might also outsource work to other companies to create velocity – providing quality and flexibility while reducing or maintaining low costs.",
            "So, another shocking truth has come to light. There's a sign in Burma reading, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, the star of Juno, stood alone on a street corner with a cardboard sign, the message written in Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country under the control of a tyrannical military junta that seized power in 1962. Just a decade ago, the country saw widespread public protests led by Buddhist monks. These peaceful gatherings, known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" turned violent, with the military cracking down on the monks and ransacking monasteries. Foreign journalists were arrested and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed for being present at a protest. The official death toll is 13, but a defected colonel puts the number closer to several thousand.\n\nThis isn't new; it's a recurring theme throughout history. From early Roman emperors declaring themselves gods to the current U.S. president consulting with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, governments have always sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control. Notable instances include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where the official death toll ranges from 200 to 3,000, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the government, systematically murdered Tutsis. Nazi Germany's \"Third Reich\" is another extreme example, during which anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed. It's a grim reminder of the lengths governments will go to protect their power.",
            "Well, Duke Ellington's influence on jazz is primarily due to his perseverance and exceptional talent at orchestrating his band. His subtle presence on the piano in many tracks is overshadowed by his brilliance as a composer. Ellington was a master at crafting complex pieces that highlighted the unique skills of his musicians. He established a framework where soloists could freely improvise, while also writing intricate arrangements that showcased the distinct styles of his band members. This balance allowed him to create original and cohesive sounds that were tailor-made for each piece, resulting in some of the most innovative jazz compositions in history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of the voice as a musical instrument, as seen in his early piece, Creole Love Call. This song demonstrates his ability to incorporate the voice to add depth and color without lyrics. The piece features a call and response between the voice and reeds, with the voice starting smoothly and transitioning to a rougher sound by the end of the first chorus. The six-chorus structure showcases a variety of solos, from a muted trumpet solo in the second chorus to a soaring clarinet solo in the third. The climactic fifth chorus features a high-register call and response, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The sixth chorus returns to the initial structure, with the voice employing a \"growl\" technique. The tag features a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending, highlighting Ellington's mastery in using voices and instruments interchangeably.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a layer of tone color is a consistent stylistic trait in his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, he showcased his ability to blend tight orchestration with unique tone colors. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing exemplifies this, combining Miley's vocal elements with Cox's instrumental voice. Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) further illustrates this approach, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton’s muted trombone introduction of the melody.\n\nEllington’s legacy is defined by his ability to empower his band members while creating cohesive and innovative compositions, making him one of the most influential figures in jazz history.",
            "Well, I have this persistent feeling of lacking something. It's been with me since I was 14, entering my teenage life. And even now, at 17, it's still there. I thought I wanted a person more than anything else, but no one has caught my interest. Some boys have tried, but none of them have appealed to me. I often wonder what this peculiar situation is about. Over the past few years, I've tossed up several theories, but nothing concrete has stuck. So I continue to live my life, questioning my desires. A typical day at home is usually peaceful. My parents are both calm and get along well, even with me. We don't argue much, except when I try to assert my independence and vibrant personality. They're good people, and I think my lively nature makes me quite likeable. But today was different. As I wandered from room to room, looking for inspiration, I heard my mother scream from the kitchen. I rushed in and found her lying on the floor, obviously in pain. She told me to take her to the hospital. I carried her to the car and drove straight to the ER. The scent of disinfectant and sickness filled the air, but I was too focused on helping her. At the hospital, they took her to be examined. She had fallen while trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet.",
            "So this study was all about proving that sticking to a Mediterranean diet (Med diet), especially if you've got a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", is tied to a lower risk of getting chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, and even dying from a stroke. The aMed diet is basically a tweak on the Med diet, with more plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, along with more monounsaturated fats and fish, and less animal products and saturated fats. It's okay to have a bit of alcohol too.\n\nPreviously, studies showed that following the Med diet is linked to a lower risk of dying from heart disease or cardiovascular problems, and in a trial, it was better than a low-fat diet for losing weight and lowering \"bad\" cholesterol in people who are overweight. But no one had looked into stroke or stroke deaths.\n\nNow, this research followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 who didn't have heart disease or diabetes and were part of the Nurses' Health Study. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, they calculated an aMed diet score using food questionnaires. Over 95% of the nurses stayed in the study for the entire 20 years. These questionnaires were checked for accuracy. Reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, death certificates, or even autopsies. If records weren't available, cases were considered \"probable\" and included in the study.\n\nTo get a better idea of each person's long-term diet, the study used average aMed scores from the repeated questionnaires. They also adjusted for things that might mess up the results, like age, smoking, body weight, menopause, hormone use, vitamin intake, alcohol, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThey used something called Cox proportional-hazard modeling to see how an aMed score was linked to the risk of heart disease and stroke. In the end, they found that women who stuck to the Mediterranean diet the most (based on their aMed score) had a lower risk of getting heart disease and stroke. During the 20 years, they found 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from heart disease or stroke. Women who were in the top group for aMed score had a 29% lower risk for heart disease and stroke compared to those in the bottom group (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "So, fast forward to 2007. The good ol' US of A found itself in a real pickle - a financial crisis that was as crushing as it was unexpected. Joblessness skyrocketed, the housing market went belly up, and some of America's biggest fish in the corporate pond were left floundering. The thing is, how did we end up here, and how do we keep it from happening again?\n\nWell, let's rewind to the Clinton years, specifically 1999. The prez was eyeing a second term, and he figured the best way to boost his popularity was to relax lending restrictions. This move, combined with the pressure from shareholders, led to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac taking on a whole lot of sub-prime mortgages and repackaging them into CDOs and CDSs. When the borrowers couldn't make their loan payments, the banks found themselves in a right mess, and the consequences were felt throughout the economy.\n\nThere were plenty of factors that pushed the economy into a tailspin, one of which was the newfangled mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs were all the rage before the crisis, and they only made the economy more intertwined with the housing market. This left households and financial markets super vulnerable to even the smallest price changes.\n\nAs the housing bubble popped, the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities got a rude awakening. The top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which was about a third of the USA’s GDP. Things got so bad that Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch got sold off cheap, Lehman Brothers went kaput, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become regular old commercial banks with heavy regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in the red, and they ended up under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That section of your narrative where you attempt to flex your writer's wings and soar to new heights, or where your readers may fall asleep and abandon ship. Dr. Merlin has often found herself screaming at her monitor when she encounters too much information, none of which is in a fun way.\n\nExposition isn't your friend. Your readers already know the basics, like \"show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into lengthy passages where nothing happens, or where too much does. Exposition is the little demon sitting on your shoulder, whispering, \"Get the history out of the way to get to the good parts\" (though not to be confused with the other devil on your shoulder that wants to tell you every last detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition means sharing what happened with your audience, typically in straightforward prose. In film, it's when one character delivers a monologue of information, like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author is the one doing the telling.\n\nLet's consider an example. As you read a story, you learn that the heroine met her beloved at a certain place and time, got married in a grand style, and then witnessed her husband's murder. You wouldn't expect all of that to take up two pages, during which both characters only exchange a handful of lines. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, showing by his words and actions how deeply he loved his wife. You'd also expect the heroine to reveal through her actions and thoughts how much his presence changed her life. A thorough introduction to the husband's character would let you connect emotionally with his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her dreams and beliefs as seen through his eyes, and so on. You'd mourn his death with her, growing more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you'd expect substance, not just the bare bones of the story: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you must provide that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, continues*) Sometimes, it's tempting to rush through certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, and you know he used to be in the Air Force, now works nights at a gas station, was married twice, has no kids, enjoys fishing on weekends, dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nProvide the details.",
            "Well, let me tell you about the news from Columbus, Ohio. It's a bit grim, but here it goes. First off, there was a live broadcast on NBC 4 this morning, and the headline was about a guy named Shad Hostettler who had stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. They showed his mug shot, and he looked like pure evil. They spent only a couple of minutes on it, which I think was appropriate given that the story was still developing. The only details they gave were that he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I reckon they allocated a suitable amount of time to this news.\n\nNext up was a story about an 18-year-old, Travis Buyers, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, but no arrests had been made. The SWAT Team was looking into it. This story seemed quite brief, and I think that was probably because the victim was a black man, or from a black neighborhood. Now, I've noticed for years that minorities often get overlooked when they're crime victims. If it's a white person, the media goes crazy, but if it's a minority, it's lucky if it gets mentioned.\n\nFollowing that, the news covered a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. They mentioned the area where it might have happened and that the bullet was a .22 caliber from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers are offering five grand for tips leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThere was also a robbery story about a UDF on Clime Road. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. He was about six feet tall and weighed around 150 pounds. The news seemed to spend an unusual amount of time emphasizing his race.\n\nAnd finally, they reported on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was sentenced for conspiring to distribute marijuana in large quantities from Texas to Ohio. Instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years, they said \"300 months\". I'm not sure why that was, but they also mentioned he was Hispanic, which didn't seem particularly relevant to the story.",
            "There is a special tie between brothers, a bond so strong it can't be broken. This link carries with it a mix of feelings, like love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers understand each other in a way no one else can, and they often see themselves reflected in their sibling. It's in the direst of situations that this bond truly reveals itself, whether it's a force for good or ill. When these emotions surface, they come at a price. A part of understanding the feelings that stem from this fraternal bond is dealing with the fallout. When you look into your brother's eyes, you see not how others perceive you, but who you truly are. Your actions and their outcomes showcase your character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers grapple with this theme and the emotions that come with it. Amidst a lush, vividly described setting, these two boys embark on a doomed journey. The story reaches its climax with Doodle facing death from his older brother's disappointment and pride. The theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist and his interactions with Doodle, as well as the narrator's perspective, which highlights the complex emotions the protagonist feels and his view of the world around him.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single key emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their tragic last adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearns for a brother who can learn all his skills, like holding his breath underwater, running, or climbing, or even racing to Horsehead Landing. But Doodle is frail, born with a weak heart, making it unlikely he'd survive such activities. The young protagonist's dreams shatter when he realizes Doodle can't fulfill these expectations. He even entertains thoughts of suffocating Doodle with a pillow, showing his anger and frustration. Yet, Doodle's smile can melt his heart, giving him hope. This indicates that his conviction may not have been strong. Deep down, he cares for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and ingenious information-processing machine. As our technology has evolved from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. Keep in mind that these metaphors, while useful, have limitations and can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. This information is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when you see a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple aspects like color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are to determine that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the initial decisions made during bottom-up processing to speed up your recognition, like identifying it as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\n\nOnce information is processed to a certain extent, an attention filter decides its importance and which cognitive processes should access it. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name in a noisy room. There are numerous stages of processing, and the results are continually refined by attention.\n\nThe brain must store information before processing it. Memory types include sensory, working, and long-term. Information is first encoded, with specific types of encoding for each sensory stimulus. Verbal input, for instance, can be encoded structurally (what the word looks like), phonemically (what it sounds like), or semantically (what it means). Once stored, information must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for around 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained by the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are various models for how knowledge is organized in the brain, based on human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes a swipe at the looming threats of advanced technology and the capitalist system that supports it, painting a grim picture in Brave New World. The society values collective unity over individuality, with citizens brainwashed from birth to chase instant happiness. The populace is essentially puppets in a grand scheme, under the thumb of the World Controller, who dictates their every move. Looking at Brave New World through the lens of Marxism, one can't help but notice Huxley's reservations about these developments. Terms like homogenization and reification reinforce the idea that Huxley's novel is a critique of the flaws in society's economic structures of his time.\n\nCapitalism is openly mocked through the concept of false consciousness. Here, the common folk are blinded to the true nature of their economic standing, their interests solely driven by personal gain. This is the result of ideological control over the working class, which is clearly seen in the conditioning of Brave New World's citizens. The lower classes, like Delta and Gamma, lack their own will, with hypnopædia reinforcing a drive to consume and indulge, all manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where a dominant group controls others, is evident here, with the lower classes unknowingly buying into the very system that oppresses them. Upper classes, while aware of this manipulation, do little to resist it, much like the few Alphas or Betas, such as Bernard, who simply accept their place. The interactions between social classes further illustrate the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nThere's no room for genuine relationships in Brave New World. Characters, even major ones, are one-dimensional, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley suggests that the rise of technology and capitalism strips us of our free will and expression. Emotions are kept shallow, with men discussing women primarily based on their physical characteristics, and women openly talking about their encounters. The societal classes' contentment with their status indicates the socioeconomic impact of capitalism, reflecting Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely made to believe their superiority through their continued consumption and obedience.",

During my freshman year, I was stuck in the East Halls dorms, which were tucked away in the far east corner of campus. Walking to classes scattered across campus, like the Willard building near the center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially when the weather was bad. I got the scoop from an alumni that not long ago, the campus was much bigger, with vast empty plots of land that have since been filled with sports fields and new buildings like the Creamery and health services facility. As the campus continues to grow, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. The solution? Cycling, of course. But bikes alone won't solve the problem. Students need to adopt them, and the campus must be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nI had a chat with a friend who recently picked up cycling after a long break. He marveled at how great bikes are and wondered why he had ever stopped. \"They’re the best way to get around,\" he said, \"especially when you're short on time and need to save energy.\" Biking doesn't just benefit your body; it's also the most efficient mode of transport. A simple bowl of oatmeal and a little exercise can take you 30 miles or more. Currently, I live off campus, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest move I made this year was buying a bike. Every day, I have classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my place, which cuts down to 5 minutes on a bike if I pedal fast. The only hiccup is that Pollock Road, the direct route to Thomas, isn't always easy to navigate, whether on bike or foot. Walking has its merits, but with my busy schedule, it's a luxury I can't afford. If I didn't have a bike, walking would be my only option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily commute. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add that to all the other time I'd spend walking to other classes, appointments, and so on—that’s more time than I can spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "In my pursuit of an education in social work, I aim to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services, dedicated to assisting abused or neglected children and supporting troubled families. Core values that I bring to the social work field include service, respect, ethical integrity, and a commitment to improve relationships and continually enhance my professional competence. These values are not just vital for social workers; they are essential to my personal growth. I have always aspired to help others, but was uncertain of the right career path. During my high school and college years, I witnessed many individuals avoiding their problems in denial and using ineffective coping mechanisms. This influenced my decision to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break to reflect on my future. One summer day, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. He was escaping his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police. I offered to help and drove to his parents’ house, where I spoke to the police and expressed my concerns. The police, seeing limited legal recourse, asked me to talk to the parents. When I questioned them about their son's “manipulative” behavior, they seemed nervous and made excuses. This experience led me to consider a career in social work to help children with family disputes.\n\nAnother crucial value in social work is social justice. Our society claims to value individuality yet often mourns lost individuals while striving to conform. I refuse to limit myself to societal norms. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively protested social injustice: dyeing my hair unnatural colors, wearing unique clothing, piercing my ears beyond traditional norms, declaring my involvement with GSBA, and fighting against racism and discrimination. I firmly believe in social justice and will continue to stand against injustice.",
            "The following paper delves into the Biological and Sociocultural models when it comes to the sleep disorder insomnia. The Biological model emphasizes inherited genetic factors and medical aspects, while the Sociocultural model explores environmental influences like race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models and presents research to explain and relate to them. Each study's findings and explanations are then critiqued for their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized into three main types: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders related to other mental disorders, and sleep disorders linked to medical conditions or substance intake. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias involve issues with initiating or maintaining sleep, such as Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, and Narcolepsy. Parasomnias, on the other hand, are characterized by abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep, like Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder. Sleep disorders linked to other mental disorders are related to Axis I or Axis II disorders.\n\nThe paper primarily focuses on insomnia and touches on primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models. The Biological model identifies genetic and physiological aspects of sleep disorders. For instance, neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice found that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep/wake states. Activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition causes reduced anxiety and sleep induction. The use of GABAB agonists like baclofen increased sleep time in the study, suggesting that mice and humans share similar genetic and environmental factors affecting sleep. This suggests that a malfunction in these receptors could impair sleep quality without medication. Socioculturally, this could mean that inherited traits influence sleep, and any alteration in these receptors could disrupt sleep and negatively impact daily life tasks.",
            "Alright, let me break this down into three main points. First off, we gotta understand what's up with Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD for short. It's basically the brain's ability to process what we hear, and when that doesn't work right, you've got CAPD. You can hear alright, but your brain's just not translating it as it should.\n\nNow, this disorder's been around since the mid-50s, back when it was called \"auditory imperception\". The Italians were the ones who started evaluating kids with comms disorders, and Kimura came up with that dichotic testing stuff. And in 1977, a big conference got everyone talking about CAPD, which led to more research.\n\nCAPD can show up in a bunch of ways. You might have trouble figuring out where sounds are coming from, or you might struggle to tell two sounds apart. Maybe you can't pick up on patterns or changes in speech, like detecting sarcasm. Or, you might have trouble hearing one sound over another. And sometimes, you just can't make sense of what you hear, or follow the order of what's being said.\n\nTo diagnose it, you need to look at how someone listens and performs on tests. This can be done by audiologists, speech therapists, psychologists, and others. There's no one-size-fits-all test, and the cause is still unknown. Some tests might play multiple sounds at once and ask you to pick out certain ones. Others might record sounds in your ear and measure your responses.",
            "Twelfth Night seems to say that although masquerade is in fact a useful tool for carrying out prolonged deceptions, in the end, a person must shed that newly adopted persona, or else risk losing oneself. The challenge of ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves estranged as a result. Therefore, one must ultimately choose between one’s own self-preservation or preserving relationships with those around them. Although some may accept the deception with neutrality, others may take it quite seriously and be offended by the charade.\n\nThe issue of deception in gender role reversal is particularly troublesome, as it raises numerous side questions, with the most crucial one being why? Why does the subject feel the need to discard their own identity and take on the guise of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it is clearly a form of self-defense: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249) Having newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels compelled to pretend to be a man to safeguard herself from potential assailants. Her plan works, but it also isolates her from the women around her, cutting her off from a vital support network. To make matters worse, she is so convincing in her disguise that Olivia mistakes her for Sebastian and falls in love with her: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) She also has to grapple with suppressed romantic feelings between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261)\n\nWhile this could be seen as a progressive stance, to a modern reader, Twelfth Night may serve as an example of how deception can help uncover repressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Some passages suggest that these characters may harbor unexpressed subconscious desires that the presence of Viola/Cesario forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because he appears to be a man, or does she secretly have feelings for women? One might argue that this is not the case, as Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems to be more likely to judge others based solely on their appearance.\n\nThis is evident by the ease with which Olivia shifts her romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to view Cesario/Viola as a family member rather than a romantic interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "Another month has passed. Life's been pretty much the same, nothing much happening. But let me fill you in on what did occur. I finally completed the beta version of the tradenet website, after a lot of procrastination, I'll admit. Probably gonna register the domain and launch the site around the middle of January. The delay was due to a lack of funds and a means to transfer it to the web host. My partner's getting his credit card in January, so that's when we'll set it up. I also flunked accounting. I guess I knew it was coming, but it still stings. I scored a 47 out of 100. I put in an appeal, not expecting much, but at least there's hope. I did get distinctions for law and economics, though. I suppose if you like a course, you're more motivated to do well in it. But if it's easy to understand, you're more likely to like it. So it's a catch-22 situation. I'll find out the appeal result this week, fingers crossed.\n\nNot much else has happened, so that's all for now. Until next time.\n\nSo, I've been dealing with this affliction called shyness. Talking to strangers, especially the opposite sex, turns me into jelly. I can't think, start trembling, and freeze up. It happened today at the YEN meeting. Couldn't even tell Genevieve that I hadn't received the club mailing list invitation. I'm working on this, though. That's one of the reasons I joined YEN - to force myself into situations that make me interact with strangers, especially those from the opposite gender. I won't get anywhere in life if I can't do this. It's so frustrating to want something so bad but be too afraid to reach out and grab it. I WILL overcome this disability. The only way is through increased interaction.\n\nAnother problem I'm dealing with is negative thinking, which affects my motivation. I don't want to sound cliché, but it's true. It's mostly my mom's fault. She's so negative all the time, and it's rubbed off on me. I'm working on changing this, though. I talked to a YEN guy I met through Darren, a total 'Adam Knoo' convert. He made me realize how negative my thoughts have been lately. I'm going to stop using the word 'try' and use 'MUST' instead. It makes a huge difference. I MUST come up with a study and work schedule this Sunday and STICK to it.\n\nWell, Kings got himself a girlfriend. Wouldn't have thought that would happen anytime soon. Shows how life can surprise you. I don't blame him, but the reasons for their relationship are a bit suspect. I'm not sure if he's really into her or if he's just trying to prove something to himself. I hope he's happy, though.\n\nI've been lazy about updating my blog for a while, but I'm back now. School holidays are here, and I hope I passed all my papers. I'm heading down to the registry of companies today to register a business partnership with Kumar. I'm calling it 'Epac Trading Company' in honor of our earlier partnership plans. I'm also working on tradenet, which I loathe, but I promised I'd do it.\n\nI just read an article about Bill Cosby's remarks on the culture of victimism in America. It made me think about the culture of victimism in the civilized world today. I get tired of people blaming everything but themselves for their troubles. Unless you're mentally incapacitated, you're responsible for your life. What's the point of blaming everything? Why not take action? I'm trying to do that by setting specific life goals and being disciplined about working towards them. You can't go anywhere if you don't have a clear goal.\n\nI slept at 10 last night, something I haven't done in ages. I must study economics tomorrow, MUST. Saying 'will' is not enough, I need to say 'MUST'. I MUST complete the first three topics tomorrow. I know it's ambitious, considering my procrastinating past, but I MUST do it. I'm answering to myself, and lying to myself is far worse than lying to anyone else.\n\nIt's been a week and a half since the last semester ended. The holidays flew by. This is probably the last holiday I'll have to laze around and do nothing. The next one, at the end of this year, will be busy with the DPP project and starting up the tuition center. The following one, in mid-2005, I'll be in Melbourne at RMIT for most of that month. I look forward to earning my keep, but I don't want to leave the security of school so soon. But time marches on, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. I just hope life doesn't chew me up and spit me out. But that's just being pessimistic. Remember, the glass is half full!\n\nI was just in a contemplative mood, thinking about how it's sad that good friends can grow apart as you grow up. You gain new perspectives, and those might not align with your friends. Sometimes it's due to differing views or circumstances. Some things are out of your control, but most aren't. It's a choice we all have to make. I've had many good people in my life. It's sad to reminisce about the good times, but I don't want to hold them back from shaping me into the person I am today or the person I'll be tomorrow. The choices we make.",
            "The classification of popular music has expanded over the last 100 years to encompass a vast array of genres, making it challenging to list them all. This is further complicated by the fact that most genres, from rap to country, and jazz to folk, have spawned numerous sub and sub-sub genres. Heavy Metal rock, particularly, has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres in popular music over the past 40 years. It's expressive because it conveys a wide range of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker side of the spectrum. It's also diverse as individuals quickly recognized its flexibility, leading to the creation of their own sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a chain that continues to this day.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement has evolved to the point where it's hard to define what exactly heavy metal is. It has absorbed themes from various other genres but, like everything else, it originated from somewhere. To truly understand the metal music prevalent today, one must first comprehend what the metal movement is and why it's considered a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement shaped by darkness. It can be seen as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. There's less primitivism and more technical skill; metal bands truly know how to play their instruments, and it's evident in their music. Metal is also, notably, a drug-induced movement. The mid-70s psychedelic drug boom led to artists creating wild, otherworldly records, using drugs as a catalyst for their creation. It possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which was new to the music scene as much of popular music didn't delve into the darker emotional spectrum. Later generations of metal artists also took inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like the following exemplify this:",
            "A few decades before the Surrealists began painting their dreamlike works, Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own dreams in both literal and figurative ways. The Dream, a painting from 1910 by the renowned Post-Impressionist, depicts not just a woman in awe of the wonders she experiences in a dream, but also Rousseau’s own dreams and aspirations as an artist. Ever since he started his journey, he longed for recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art lovers, only to confront a challenging internal conflict: to either imitate existing styles to gain acceptance or to forge his own unique path. The Dream encapsulates Rousseau’s lifelong struggle with this dilemma.\n\nTo truly understand The Dream, we must first delve into Rousseau’s life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France, his father was a prosperous tinsmith and hardware dealer. He grew up without formal art training and worked as a gabelou for France until the age of forty, erroneously known as a douanier, or customs inspector. After the loss of his first wife and eight children, Rousseau turned to painting for solace and new beginnings. Unlike many of his contemporaries, who romanticized the peasant in their paintings, Rousseau was a folk artist, reflecting the aspirations and dreams of the common class.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance by the art world is understandable given his background: he was uneducated in formal painting and began his career later in life, working alongside more established and recognized artists. It was not until around the same time that Matisse was building his reputation that Rousseau started to gain recognition for his art. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, “Matisse was a painter who feared painting in a conventional way, while Rousseau strove to paint in a conventional manner to be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Another thing that's captured my attention is the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics that many great thinkers have explored. It's not just about education or experience, but something more profound. As John Keats put it in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Ethics and aesthetics seem to talk to each other without us even realizing it. We often study art and morals to understand why something is beautiful or right, rather than to prescribe specific rules for beauty or morality. Even when we try to describe what makes a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa great, we often find ourselves saying, \"There's just something about it\" before diving into a more complex explanation. This is because art and morals can't be fully captured by description alone. Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Both art and morals have this transcendent quality, this ineffable \"something\" that makes them so powerful. This \"something\" is what connects ethics and aesthetics. I believe this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics is the reason they feel so deeply impactful, especially when it comes to literature. As McKean argues, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts... is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany in its present form is a powerful, united country, with a rich cultural tapestry that weaves through its landscape, from the scenic Alps in München to the Baltic Sea coastal city of Kiel. This unique blend of culture is evident whether you are in Köln by the Rhine, the heart of Germany, or the historical city of Dresden on the Elbe. Given the diverse origins of its inhabitants, it's not surprising that Germany, as we know it today, is a fusion of various tribes and influences.\n\nThe origins of the name \"Germania\" are shrouded in historical debate. Some scholars claim it comes from the Germanic tribe known as Tungrians, who were once called Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, first used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others suggest the name is derived from the German spear, known as a \"ger\" (O.E.D., 2010), or from the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" implying the Germans were loud or warlike (Names of Germany).\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" described the Germans as \"aboriginal\" and not mixed with other races through immigration. He questioned why anyone would leave the warm climates of Asia or Africa for the harsher lands of Germany, with its wild terrain, harsh weather, and stern demeanor (Tacitus, 98). The Romans, while they often raided German lands for resources, generally preferred to return to their own empire rather than settle in Germania (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).\n\nAs the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the outskirts of the Roman Empire. They traded their land-grown goods and served in the Roman army, integrating their skills and culture into the Roman fold (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I looked down at the view in front of me, my mind as blank as the scene itself. Silently, unemotionally, with a practiced eye that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding, I analyzed the picture. Thoughts flowed in and out like a gentle stream. It was as if I had no thoughts of my own, just an active and fluid experience of what I was seeing. Once, an artist I worked with suggested I get a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I had always wanted to learn to draw, and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to the brain's processes for interpreting lines. One technique it teaches is to place a square frame around any picture to simplify it. At that moment, standing there, I couldn't mentally project that frame. I was too overwhelmed, too awed. I felt like I was at the beginning of my own artistic journey, starting my own story. Fingertips lightly touched my chosen art tool, muscles tensed and relaxed as I began to recreate the scene in my mind. Water swirled smoothly, crystals clear and clean. A flurry of matter broke away, carried away to nothingness. My hand smacked the handle again, the brown package still stubbornly in place. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet thought, and then I gripped the toilet paper like a gloved hand. I stood up, then bent at the waist, and slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, like a mother retrieving a Thanksgiving turkey from the oven...",
            "Another grim trend has emerged among our youth, one that's been claiming lives behind the wheel. Several elements converge to create this deadly pattern for our youngest drivers. The National Institutes of Health highlight that the teen brain is simply not equipped to handle the perils of driving, and this lack of experience leads to more fatal accidents, as well as a higher rate of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. But the hazards don't stop there—teens are even more vulnerable when driving with their friends, a fact that anyone with an inkling of common sense understands. Studies have shown that the presence of passengers, especially teens, significantly increases the risk of accidents. California and other states have implemented measures like temporary provisional licenses, limiting driving hours and passengers, but these are merely Band-Aids. The core issue is that, collectively, our youngest drivers aren't ready to handle the risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman even suggests that 18 is too young for a standard driver's license, citing research that shows teens under 19-20 often seek out thrills and risks. Therefore, delaying driving until this tendency subsides could help reduce accidents and save lives. By 2010, the first wave of Baby Boomer's children will be eligible to drive, potentially adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads. A sensible solution is to continue driver's education classes in schools, but no one under 18 should be allowed to drive a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued, with a set number of practical driving hours required, mirroring existing state requirements. Uniform, national legislation could help protect teens across the country. This approach is not a new idea.",
            "After sifting through the Library of Congress’s treasure trove of early Edison films, I made it my mission to watch all the trick films from 1895 to 1901, numbering fifteen in total. These films are known for their clever use of editing to create illusions. My study primarily focused on describing the poetic elements of the bulk of these trick films and exploring the unique qualities of a few of the latter films. Most trick films from this era adhere to a set-bound style, confined within a frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, and utilizing long and medium shots. They stick to the one shot equals one film method. However, some films at the dawn of the twentieth century were bold enough to break these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common thread among these trick films is their use of an interior set confined within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationery, not moving to follow figures or objects. This style finds its roots in the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. The constraint of the stage means that figures in trick films usually move side-to-side, never walking towards or away from the camera. A clear example is the action in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). Actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, but the camera never follows them out of the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also dictates that shots are typically long and occasionally medium shots. Close-ups are absent from all the trick films in the Edison catalog. This is a nod to the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where audiences saw the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. As in most early films, actors don’t move towards the camera, so close-ups are non-existent.\n\nMost early trick films follow the rule that one conceptual shot equates to one film. This caps the length at about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. It also limits the dramatic or narrative scope of the films; most focus on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. However, in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes doesn’t correspond to a physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be composed of several joined together to create illusions of apparition or disappearing. Examine The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A closer look reveals that the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "So John Taylor of Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republicanism. Though primarily an agriculturalist, his career in politics greatly influenced his dedication and vocal support for personal freedom and government. His commitment to an agrarian system shaped his views on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the United States as a unique opportunity to create an ideal system, unhampered by traditional constraints, allowing for self-government. He firmly believed in the natural rights of man, asserting their interdependence—if one is denied, the rest fail, and their remaining value diminishes. These rights should remain beyond government reach. He argued that the \"state of nature\" allowed the powerful and malevolent to thrive, but civilization must prevent this.\n\nTo establish an ideal society, Taylor believed a government should account for human goodness and evil. He was rigid in his dualistic morality, claiming, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). Good principles, like protecting private property and agriculture, and discouraging capitalism, were fundamental. A government founded on these principles would function fairly despite its administration's self-interest.\n\nTaylor, like other Republicans of his time, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution. He wanted a minimal Federal Government, with no rights or powers beyond those explicitly stated. He recognized potential corruption in a literal interpretation without considering the writers' intent. He considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter, as it described the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Alright, so let's revisit Figure 17. A major dip in commuter log submissions happened in the third month of our project. That was a bit of a bummer, and the reason behind it? Well, it's a bit unclear. The New England winter might've been the culprit, with fewer folks commuting by bike or on foot. Plus, December is the end of the semester, leaving many with schoolwork and grades on their minds, possibly causing the log to slip their radar. On top of that, the holiday season brings a month-long break for students and faculty, with many not needing to come to campus at all. Classes resume in late January, which could explain the low February log submissions. But what about the February dip? It could just be a natural ebb and flow of excitement with any new project. To combat this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which did bring back some of our log submissions. So, we faced the challenge of keeping the momentum going despite holiday breaks and a decline in natural excitement. Another big issue for this or any similar project is the deep cultural love for the freedom and flexibility of driving. To counter this, we offered various prizes like gift cards to local places. It'd be awesome to see if bigger prizes like a bicycle, hybrid, or electric car would've boosted participation. The value of the prizes didn't change throughout the project, but announcing bigger prizes later might've helped. The gift cards were great at the start, but adding some bicycles and cars as bigger prizes could've been a game-changer.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of investment that is designed to mimic the performance of an index, a commodity, or a group of assets, similar to an index fund. However, unlike index funds, ETFs trade like stocks on an exchange. This setup offers several advantages: the diversification of an index fund, the flexibility of selling short, buying on margin, and the ability to purchase as few as one share at a time. While these benefits are enticing, it's important to note that ETFs come with a downside—the need to pay a commission on trades, much like stock orders. Additionally, ETFs offer a wide range of funds to choose from. However, as a savvy investor, it's crucial to assess whether the stated advantages, such as diversification, genuinely exist and to what extent they do so.\n\nFor this analysis, let's examine the ETF IHF and compare it to its top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of its total assets. The top holdings and their respective percentages are as follows:\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF, we can calculate the contribution of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio were composed entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions that the ETF has established. The Beta and Return calculations for each stock are shown in the chart below.\n\nFrom this chart, it's clear that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, a 16% increase. Moreover, the Beta of this portfolio is 0.12 points lower than the ETF's overall Beta. These initial results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower risk, but it's essential to determine if these portfolios are statistically different from one another.\n\nTo assess this, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their combined standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" is often regarded as one of his superior works. Within it, he employs the term \"Thulé,\" which Mabbott attributes to Virgil. Virgil referred to an island north of Britain, marking the edge of the known world. While Virgil indeed used the term, a more recent and significant influence should be recognized. Poe was deeply interested in German literature, particularly the works of Goethe.\n\nThis knowledge is significant because it reveals Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" notes the similarities between the two poets' works, suggesting that Poe was inspired by Goethe. Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of poetic drama, including his magnum opus \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his death. Within \"Faust,\" Part II contains a short poem titled \"The King of Thule,\" which tells of a king whose wife dies after giving him a goblet. Overwhelmed by sorrow, he drinks heavily and cries, then decides to end his life by throwing the goblet into the sea. His actions and the description of the king in \"Dream-Land\" bear a striking resemblance, hinting at a dark reflection of Poe's own experiences.\n\nPoe references \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" but in \"Dream-Land,\" he uses the term as a framing device. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a dark, lonely landscape where he is haunted by deceased friends, which mirrors the feelings of the king in \"The King of Thule.\" Both poems depict a world without color and life, suggesting that the speaker has stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was an influential author, and Poe would have been exposed to his work through various reproductions and his admiration for Tennyson, whom Poe greatly respected. When asked if he admired Tennyson, Poe's response underscored his familiarity with German literature and the works of Goethe.",
            "Alright, another thing I'd like to talk about is this legal conundrum. Could a customer injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice? Well, under California law, it's not a clear-cut case. To prove punitive damages, the plaintiff needs to show that the defendant's actions were intentional and that they were committed with a willful disregard for the probable harm that would result. In Jennifer Palmer's case, she fell on an applesauce spill that was reported twice to the manager, Paul Martin, but he failed to clean it up because he was eating dinner. Six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the store before Palmer's accident, so it's reasonable for her to argue that Martin should have known the risk and still failed to act. However, proving that Martin's actions were despicable might be more challenging. But given the circumstances, her claim is not without merit.",
            "Four years ago, I took a course on Islam at CBC where a significant topic of debate was whether Islam is inherently hostile. This discussion remains pertinent today. Since 9/11, I've witnessed a shift in media portrayal, from hostility towards both Islam and extremists to an extreme form of tolerance toward Islam in America. In 2001, it would've been unthinkable to imagine a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, who has a Muslim background in his family.\n\nThe life story of Muhammad, as presented in the biography, is intriguing but seems to contradict historical accounts. From what I know, Muhammad was depicted as a forceful figure who conquered tribes and coerced them into adopting Islam. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble, who attracted followers through his teachings and miracles. This portrayal seems designed to present him as a humble prophet who needed no proof but was centered around truth and miracles. This approach trivializes the life and miracles of Jesus, as if Muhammad is being used to take credit for Jesus' life and personhood.\n\nAdditionally, many stories in the biography suggest an agenda to provide evidence of voluntary conversions. However, these accounts often come from third-party sources, which I find suspicious. For instance, the author might claim to have heard from someone who heard it from someone else, weakening the credibility of the stories.\n\nWhat bothers me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man. Historical records suggest otherwise, and I can't help but wonder if current Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "So, the lessons Jesus taught and his beliefs during his life have been left behind in the evolution of Christian thought, which has since moved on from its roots after his life. If we look at the broader picture, we see that Christianity has strayed further and further from its origin over time. Today's world shows an increasing awareness and unprecedented progressiveness. While traditional people and thinkers still exist and might resist any new ideas, they may not have the influence to shape the whole. Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow significantly in the coming years. There will be a growing desire to distinguish the doctrines that have been added to Christianity over time from the original intent of the religion's founder. It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable: a reversal in the trend of Christian history. There will be a movement that removes layers of doctrine, one by one, as if the clock is turning back, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God remains, before any other thinkers made such claims. When this trend spreads through the United States and Europe, influencing masses to worship as if they were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way. However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions of every kind, we will see increasing similarities instead of differences. Human history is filled with great reversions. An example is how Christians once were persecuted, shunned, and killed by the Roman Empire, but later that empire became a Christian institution. Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process. It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus' words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements. So, what happened after Jesus' lifetime?\n\nLooking far back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were all at the core of the religion even as the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not united. They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common people.",
            "Oh, so The Jungle, it's all about how humans, deep down, are greedy and self-centred, huh? They're all about making their own lives as cushy as possible, never mind who gets stepped on along the way. Sinclair makes it crystal clear with his descriptions of the factory owners and managers. They're just after big, fat profits, not caring a whit about anyone or anything in their path, including the pollution they spew out. \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" he writes. They couldn't care less about the smoke, the animal waste, or even the people they're exploiting.\n\nAnd the workers? Well, they're just tools for these greedy folks to make money with. They'll do anything to squeeze out an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". Workers are forced to work in appalling conditions, with no job security and no safety net. Back then, there were barely any laws protecting workers' rights, so managers could run amok, pushing workers to the breaking point. And if you can't handle it, well, tough luck. There were no unions to help, just more people looking to make a buck off the workers' misery. It was a system of slavery, plain and simple, with workers \"dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Many authors have their own methods to evoke certain feelings or ideas in their readers, with some techniques proving more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs a variety of these methods in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, he combines an adjective and a noun in an unusual way to create a certain atmosphere around a subject. Other times, he imbues a symbol with meaning and then uses it to convey that same meaning. Fitzgerald frequently uses this latter technique with colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel, he attributes specific meanings to white/gray and red/pink before later employing those meanings to evoke feelings around important objects.\n\nFitzgerald associates white/gray with uniformity, with white being slightly more elegant and refined, and gray representing something older and worn. He establishes this connection at the beginning of the novel by repeatedly using both colors. Daisy and Jordan are continually “in white” (8), and everyone else is dressed in white as well: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears a “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). The only exceptions are when Nick is observing Gatsby’s party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). He also uses these colors to describe ordinary objects and people: the “names” at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray” (61) on Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—uniformity (28). He uses white/gray to describe ordinary or common people and places, such as Daisy and Jordan having a “white girlhood” (19), the “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of ashes, the “Italian child” is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\n\nAfter building up these meanings, Fitzgerald employs them to signify unimportance or uniformity for certain subjects. This use of colors to convey meaning starts with Daisy. After a prolonged period without significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster,” causing readers to perceive her as less of a character and more like a uniform object that Gatsby desires and longs for (74). He continues this technique around Daisy to emphasize her uniformity, for example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.",
            "San Diego County is pretty much a powerhouse when it comes to agriculture, with its mild and sunny climate. The area's main crops include tomatoes, lemons, peaches, berries, honey, and a variety of leafy greens, squash, broccoli, and peppers. There's a pretty solid demand in the area for organic, community-supported agriculture, with many local groups having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also quite popular. Many organic farms here offer tours of their operations and access for activities like hiking and birdwatching, which can help the landowner make some extra cash or provide educational experiences. This kind of setup would let the landowner benefit from government programs while also improving habitat, providing recreational activities, and creating opportunities for farm tours and other programs.",
            "So, culture, it's a big deal in any negotiation. It's not something you can define with one word or one stereotype. It's like saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" right? That's way too broad and simple. Instead, it's better to understand how a culture affects the conversation at hand and how it plays into the negotiation. When you're dealing with a foreign culture, you'll compare it to your own, and that's normal. But it's important not to judge or change a culture, but to work within it, especially if you're at a disadvantage.\n\nUnderstanding a culture can mean looking into its past or seeing its prejudices. You don't have to agree with them or try to change them, just accept them for what they are. And when you're in a foreign environment, respect can go a long way in breaking down cultural barriers and moving the negotiation forward.\n\nCulture isn't just about national boundaries. Companies also have their own cultures. Some might value long work hours, others a relaxed schedule. You can see a company's culture in how employees dress, how they communicate, and how they hire. Even within the same country, there's a lot of diversity. For example, American companies can have very different cultures. Some might encourage employee philanthropy, others might restrict it. The point is, a lot of thought goes into the culture of a society or a company.\n\nValues are key too, because they tell you why a culture is the way it is. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, you won't publicly shame anyone at the negotiation table. And if a culture values a hard-driven bargain, you won't settle too quickly. Understanding these generalities before you start negotiating can really help. But it's also important to learn about your opponent on a personal level to make the negotiation effective.",
            "So, as it stands, let's assume that both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas are onto something with their beliefs in the existence of the God of the Bible. After all, they're both arguing for the same thing, so we'll start with that premise. However, I'm not convinced that either of them really gives a solid foundation for believing in God. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's take a look at St. Anselm's argument. He's all about finding God within ourselves, using our own understanding to prove his existence. He says that because God is within our comprehension, we can't really grasp his nonexistence. It's a bit convoluted, but the gist is that we don't need external evidence to know God is real; we just need to look inside ourselves. This is essentially faith, as it's accepting something without irrefutable proof.\n\nNow, contrast that with Thomas Aquinas. He's all about reason and empirical evidence. He believes we can prove God's existence using logic, without any faith. This is super handy for conversions, as we can convince people with reasoning alone. He's got five arguments for God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He shows that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for his existence.\n\nSo, while they both have valid points, I think neither really gives a complete picture for believing in God.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future Buddha was born. Over his lifetime, he gave up the world, attained enlightenment, and his teachings became Buddhism, specifically Theravada Buddhism, which has existed for around twenty-five hundred years. The religion, from its customs to its core beliefs, has evolved since Buddha's time. For instance, in Sri Lanka, a Theravada nation, an annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated, a practice Buddha never taught. Differences extend from superficial traditions to the religion's essence. Both monastic and lay communities have had to adjust their doctrines over time due to external and internal influences, both friendly and hostile.\n\nThis discussion will frequently use terms like internal and external forces. Internal forces come from Buddhists, regardless of their status, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces harm or aim to harm the Buddhist community, born of a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces, while not intentionally helping or harming, may do so as a result.\n\nLet's start by understanding the basics of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. The Dhamma, composed of the Tripitaka—three baskets of Buddhist texts—includes the Sutta Pitaka (Suttas), Vinaya Pitaka (disciplinary rules), and Abhidhamma Pitaka (metaphysical components like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering, and Anicca—impermanence of all things). Recognizing these concepts helps end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and cease lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, upon enlightenment.\n\nThe Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for life. Laypeople follow five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances), while monks follow many more rules. The four noble truths form the fundamental doctrine: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. The height of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States defeated Mexico and gained new territories like Texas and the American Southwest (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). Apart from this war, there were numerous other skirmishes between the two nations that finally subsided just before World War I.\n\nThis scenario is not unique to the U.S. and Mexico; many nations that share a border often have disputes due to shared interests. David M. Pletcher (1977) points out that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41), stressing the closeness of these nations to the U.S. and their historic rivalries, unlike other Latin American nations which have typically enjoyed good relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious issues were a significant factor in the rivalry between the U.S. and Mexico, much like the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p.86). The enduring distrust between the U.S. and Mexico can be traced back to the historical tension between the English and Spanish, which carried over into their colonial legacies.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during their 57-year rivalry, with most of these disputes being territorial issues related to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems. Border raids by bandits and outlaws from American border towns were a persistent problem until both nations exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to wane as \"Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way\" (p. 109) and ended as American ambitions shifted \"from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico\" (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century.",
            "Fifteen‭ ‬years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly struck down by an illness that I had never known existed. I was a nurse at the time, having chosen my profession out of a deep-seated need for the safety and security that eluded me as a child. The mantra I heard as I grew older was, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" So, even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist—preferably a bit of both—I chose nursing.\n\nYet there I was: 46‭ ‬years old, single, with no money to speak of, and unable to work. To this day, I am disabled, and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability, I have absolutely nothing left that I can call my own. I manage to get by, but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore, yet there's one thing I know to be true—I could not have made it through these years without the help of my family and a few good friends, no matter how strong I was. And believe me, when real disaster strikes, you do not feel very strong at all.\n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life—big and small. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well one prepares, some things are just too big to overcome on one's own.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that we in the U.S. need to stop relying so heavily on big government. Lord knows it's crumbling. Yet, I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again—learning to help each other and to ask for help—rather than each of us individually scrambling to build fallout shelters in our backyards.\n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the \"rugged individualism\" that built this country, but in truth, what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism, it was compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone.\n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit—first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and plastic sheeting for the windows in case of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and batteries, candle and waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food—do it. It's a great idea, as is a wood stove, as long as you don't live in an apartment.\n\nBut while you're at it, get to know your neighbors.",
            "So, why do organisms evolve the way they do? Are there limits or constraints that guide evolutionary change? While in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson stated that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" the same can still be said today. More recently, mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny, for example, as seen in Raup and Stanley's work from 1981. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help understand the mechanisms behind the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to define quantitative parameters that could be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a tube that extends through 360 degrees of space over time. These turns or revolutions of a coiled shell are called whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis called the columella. The columella runs through the central column of the shell. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, known as a suture. The largest whorl of a shell is typically the last one, called the body whorl, with the spire being all the whorls except the last one. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is the base. The animal exits its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The \"usual\" orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture pointing toward the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical view and determine where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts, then count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures traveling through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced via the coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a mathematical formulation is made, parameters can be varied and modified to alter the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.",
            "Well, another decade has passed, and Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates haven't moved an inch. While the country's on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, like water and sanitation, the progress in child and maternal health has been dismally slow, falling short of the target. Let's delve into the reasons behind these shortcomings and the urgent need to bolster the overall health system rather than just focusing on specific programs.\n\nLooking at the numbers, it's clear that Indonesia's progress in having skilled birth attendants is somewhat misleading. While 72% of births now have a skilled worker present, traditional midwives can't provide medical interventions, leading to a high maternal death rate from hemorrhage. Additionally, there's a decline in treating diarrheal cases in children under five. Postnatal care data is also incomplete, but it's evident that this area needs attention, with low rates across the country. Cesarian-section rates are still low, at 4%, but there's a worrying discrepancy between urban and rural areas, with a 5% rate in cities and only 2% in rural settings. This inequity in access to healthcare is clear, as is the stark difference in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, with a 27% gap.\n\nWhen considering next steps for improving neonatal and maternal care, a crucial question is how to tackle the service gap effectively. Should Indonesia focus on program-specific approaches or strengthen the health system as a whole? Programmatic approaches are attractive because they offer targeted, manageable goals and quicker results. However, investing heavily in one area can lead to funding shortages and human resource migration to better-resourced sectors. Plus, running multiple parallel programs can cause duplications and uncoordinated services, resulting in increased paperwork.\n\nSo, there's a need to balance these approaches and consider both.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocracy. Two notable exceptions to this norm are 'Oliver Twist' and 'Wuthering Heights'. These works add an element of mystery and a hint of the unusual, which helps to deepen the characters within each story, providing insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“And now, a multitude of bewildering and confusing thoughts rushed into his mind. It seemed as if he was still walking between Sikes and Crackit, arguing fiercely. The very words they spoke echoed in his ears, and he realized that he was actually talking to them. Suddenly, he recoiled at the sound of gunshots. Shouts and screams filled his ears, and lights flashed before his eyes, everything was chaos and commotion, as an unseen force carried him away quickly. Throughout these vivid visions, a constant, vague sense of pain gnawed at him, tormenting him endlessly.\n(Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often use dream sequences or dreamlike states to incorporate this mystery. In 'Oliver Twist', these strange occurrences reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, his pains, and his awareness of the true nature of the events happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, it happens as if in a dream, as he struggles to find help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the events, as well as the dire state his health had reached, as seen through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overpowers him, numbing his senses, and he doesn't notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away. He re-experiences his despair again, removed from the initial shock of pain, now linked with constant fear. The question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, as it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything, even while his life is in danger. A sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied, suggesting that old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed – or did it? There was no day; it was gone as soon as it began – and night came on again; a night that was endless yet fleeting, long in its dreadful silence and brief in its hurried hours.",
            "A couple of years back, I was working in an after-school program, tutoring younger kids. I did my best to assist them in their studies, but my strongest subjects were English and reading. I was asked by one of the instructors to help a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. He was in third or fourth grade and spoke perfect English, which made his reading difficulties particularly puzzling. At first, I thought Adrian had some peculiar problems. He could pronounce some letters correctly, but others, not at all. It was strange. He was of Latino descent, and I knew his mother only spoke Spanish. When she came to pick him up, I realized his issue was not with reading but with knowing the English alphabet. I don't know if that revelation helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier problem in schools, especially in California. It's often not as clear-cut as we think, even for a child who speaks perfect English. Reading can still be a real challenge. This issue is acknowledged, but what can we do about it? In Adrian's case, the solution was simple: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. But for many children who barely speak English, the solution is far more complex. There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer. Combining dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, or any of these methods alone won't fix the problem. The key is to combine all these approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a fantastic idea, not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all children. Studies have shown that children in these programs outperform their peers academically. This idea is often feared as a waste of resources, but that's not accurate. If implemented widely, all children would benefit. How, though? Should we make all teachers bilingual? No, that's unreasonable. However, having bilingual aides or tutors available would be a practical solution.",
            "Since childhood, many of us are told about a force greater than ourselves, something we can't fully understand. Some learn about it at Sunday school, others at the Temple, or delve within themselves for answers. Often, we follow the religions passed down by our parents, but some reject them outright, denying any existence beyond our personal, egocentric worlds. Our values and belief systems may shift over time, but our spiritual journeys are uniquely ours. We search for light to guide us out of the darkness. \"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I asked him about his favorite bird. We sat on our porch, listening to the rain, our cigarettes offering a brief respite from the tension. He looked out into the storm, his gaze both searching and remembering. His body was gaunt, his hair sparse. I couldn't bring myself to talk about his passing, afraid it would make the reality more tangible. I hugged him, repositioned my chair, and stared into the falling rain together.\n\nMy father passed away in December, just days after I turned twenty-two. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering but not eased it. I couldn't watch my father's life end. I wanted to remember him as he lived, not die. I hid in my bed for three days, waiting for news. No one called me.",
            "The traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is essentially an \"oxymoronic fusion of 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt points out in his book The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been both reviled and lauded, accused of being shallow, and praised for its 'terrible sublime' effect (Burke). The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, combined elements of both \"ancient and modern\" romances to birth the proto-Gothic genre and a novel way of literary expression. Walpole utilizes \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he calls \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily on throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even when The Castle of Otranto was published, the term \"gothic\" was used to describe various peoples, styles, and time periods, often seen as archaic or unsophisticated compared to \"modern\" societal and literary advancements. This combination of more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing readers a deeper insight into character psychology) is what keeps Gothic literature enduring and both obsolete and fresh to readers from different times.\n\nOne of the most distinctive Gothic themes is the notion of Chivalry. The medieval concept of chivalry, the training of a proper knight, is both preserved and transformed in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is particularly significant to Gothic writers because it represents the ideal knight—brave, honorable, and competent—and the perceived lack of these qualities in contemporary society. Through the use of chivalric concepts and manners, the \"gothic past\" becomes idealized and romanticized, hinting at the evolution of Gothic to Romantic literature, and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole, who wrote The Castle of Otranto during a politically troubled time and was despairing over the future, may have felt that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" of the gothic era had been lost in the individuals of 'present' society. This concept is evident in several characters, such as Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits. The reader learns that Frederic is a prince, has suffered tragedy, and is now believed to be killed by infidels, embodying the figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" (66).",
            "So, supply chain management is all about the flow of goods from a customer's order to raw materials, through production, distribution, and finally, the customer. The term was coined in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. He saw it as the planning, implementation, and control of the entire process to meet customer needs swiftly and efficiently. Now, there are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These are the tools business managers use to deliver top-notch customer service. Let's break it down:\n\nProduction is the first step in the chain. It's the backbone, outlining when, why, where, and how things get made. Managers need to know what customers want, so they look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator of what customers demand. Once they've analyzed it, they decide what to produce and how much. Then comes the location – where and which plant will be best for volume and quality, keeping the customer in mind. After that, it's about scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Production is crucial, every detail matters. For instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target. Both had detailed processes for everything from uniforms to receiving shipments. These processes help keep things running smoothly with clear direction and expectations.\n\nThe second key element is supply. This is about making strategic decisions to determine a facility's core capabilities and decide on outsourcing partnerships. A company might have several divisions for a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers decide which division is best for each process. They might also outsource work to other companies to create velocity – providing quality and flexibility while reducing or maintaining low costs.",
            "So, another shocking truth has come to light. There's a sign in Burma reading, \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Ellen Page, the star of Juno, stood alone on a street corner with a cardboard sign, the message written in Sharpie. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian country under the control of a tyrannical military junta that seized power in 1962. Just a decade ago, the country saw widespread public protests led by Buddhist monks. These peaceful gatherings, known as \"The Saffron Revolution,\" turned violent, with the military cracking down on the monks and ransacking monasteries. Foreign journalists were arrested and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed for being present at a protest. The official death toll is 13, but a defected colonel puts the number closer to several thousand.\n\nThis isn't new; it's a recurring theme throughout history. From early Roman emperors declaring themselves gods to the current U.S. president consulting with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, governments have always sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control. Notable instances include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where the official death toll ranges from 200 to 3,000, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the government, systematically murdered Tutsis. Nazi Germany's \"Third Reich\" is another extreme example, during which anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed. It's a grim reminder of the lengths governments will go to protect their power.",
            "Well, Duke Ellington's influence on jazz is primarily due to his perseverance and exceptional talent at orchestrating his band. His subtle presence on the piano in many tracks is overshadowed by his brilliance as a composer. Ellington was a master at crafting complex pieces that highlighted the unique skills of his musicians. He established a framework where soloists could freely improvise, while also writing intricate arrangements that showcased the distinct styles of his band members. This balance allowed him to create original and cohesive sounds that were tailor-made for each piece, resulting in some of the most innovative jazz compositions in history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of the voice as a musical instrument, as seen in his early piece, Creole Love Call. This song demonstrates his ability to incorporate the voice to add depth and color without lyrics. The piece features a call and response between the voice and reeds, with the voice starting smoothly and transitioning to a rougher sound by the end of the first chorus. The six-chorus structure showcases a variety of solos, from a muted trumpet solo in the second chorus to a soaring clarinet solo in the third. The climactic fifth chorus features a high-register call and response, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The sixth chorus returns to the initial structure, with the voice employing a \"growl\" technique. The tag features a vocal run and a dissonant trombone ending, highlighting Ellington's mastery in using voices and instruments interchangeably.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a layer of tone color is a consistent stylistic trait in his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, he showcased his ability to blend tight orchestration with unique tone colors. A call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing exemplifies this, combining Miley's vocal elements with Cox's instrumental voice. Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) further illustrates this approach, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton’s muted trombone introduction of the melody.\n\nEllington’s legacy is defined by his ability to empower his band members while creating cohesive and innovative compositions, making him one of the most influential figures in jazz history.",
            "Well, I have this persistent feeling of lacking something. It's been with me since I was 14, entering my teenage life. And even now, at 17, it's still there. I thought I wanted a person more than anything else, but no one has caught my interest. Some boys have tried, but none of them have appealed to me. I often wonder what this peculiar situation is about. Over the past few years, I've tossed up several theories, but nothing concrete has stuck. So I continue to live my life, questioning my desires. A typical day at home is usually peaceful. My parents are both calm and get along well, even with me. We don't argue much, except when I try to assert my independence and vibrant personality. They're good people, and I think my lively nature makes me quite likeable. But today was different. As I wandered from room to room, looking for inspiration, I heard my mother scream from the kitchen. I rushed in and found her lying on the floor, obviously in pain. She told me to take her to the hospital. I carried her to the car and drove straight to the ER. The scent of disinfectant and sickness filled the air, but I was too focused on helping her. At the hospital, they took her to be examined. She had fallen while trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet.",
            "So this study was all about proving that sticking to a Mediterranean diet (Med diet), especially if you've got a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", is tied to a lower risk of getting chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, and even dying from a stroke. The aMed diet is basically a tweak on the Med diet, with more plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, along with more monounsaturated fats and fish, and less animal products and saturated fats. It's okay to have a bit of alcohol too.\n\nPreviously, studies showed that following the Med diet is linked to a lower risk of dying from heart disease or cardiovascular problems, and in a trial, it was better than a low-fat diet for losing weight and lowering \"bad\" cholesterol in people who are overweight. But no one had looked into stroke or stroke deaths.\n\nNow, this research followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 who didn't have heart disease or diabetes and were part of the Nurses' Health Study. Six times, from 1984 to 2004, they calculated an aMed diet score using food questionnaires. Over 95% of the nurses stayed in the study for the entire 20 years. These questionnaires were checked for accuracy. Reports of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were confirmed through medical or hospital records, death certificates, or even autopsies. If records weren't available, cases were considered \"probable\" and included in the study.\n\nTo get a better idea of each person's long-term diet, the study used average aMed scores from the repeated questionnaires. They also adjusted for things that might mess up the results, like age, smoking, body weight, menopause, hormone use, vitamin intake, alcohol, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThey used something called Cox proportional-hazard modeling to see how an aMed score was linked to the risk of heart disease and stroke. In the end, they found that women who stuck to the Mediterranean diet the most (based on their aMed score) had a lower risk of getting heart disease and stroke. During the 20 years, they found 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from heart disease or stroke. Women who were in the top group for aMed score had a 29% lower risk for heart disease and stroke compared to those in the bottom group (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "So, fast forward to 2007. The good ol' US of A found itself in a real pickle - a financial crisis that was as crushing as it was unexpected. Joblessness skyrocketed, the housing market went belly up, and some of America's biggest fish in the corporate pond were left floundering. The thing is, how did we end up here, and how do we keep it from happening again?\n\nWell, let's rewind to the Clinton years, specifically 1999. The prez was eyeing a second term, and he figured the best way to boost his popularity was to relax lending restrictions. This move, combined with the pressure from shareholders, led to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac taking on a whole lot of sub-prime mortgages and repackaging them into CDOs and CDSs. When the borrowers couldn't make their loan payments, the banks found themselves in a right mess, and the consequences were felt throughout the economy.\n\nThere were plenty of factors that pushed the economy into a tailspin, one of which was the newfangled mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs were all the rage before the crisis, and they only made the economy more intertwined with the housing market. This left households and financial markets super vulnerable to even the smallest price changes.\n\nAs the housing bubble popped, the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities got a rude awakening. The top five U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which was about a third of the USA’s GDP. Things got so bad that Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch got sold off cheap, Lehman Brothers went kaput, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to become regular old commercial banks with heavy regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in the red, and they ended up under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That section of your narrative where you attempt to flex your writer's wings and soar to new heights, or where your readers may fall asleep and abandon ship. Dr. Merlin has often found herself screaming at her monitor when she encounters too much information, none of which is in a fun way.\n\nExposition isn't your friend. Your readers already know the basics, like \"show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into lengthy passages where nothing happens, or where too much does. Exposition is the little demon sitting on your shoulder, whispering, \"Get the history out of the way to get to the good parts\" (though not to be confused with the other devil on your shoulder that wants to tell you every last detail of each character's childhood).\n\nExposition means sharing what happened with your audience, typically in straightforward prose. In film, it's when one character delivers a monologue of information, like \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author is the one doing the telling.\n\nLet's consider an example. As you read a story, you learn that the heroine met her beloved at a certain place and time, got married in a grand style, and then witnessed her husband's murder. You wouldn't expect all of that to take up two pages, during which both characters only exchange a handful of lines. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, showing by his words and actions how deeply he loved his wife. You'd also expect the heroine to reveal through her actions and thoughts how much his presence changed her life. A thorough introduction to the husband's character would let you connect emotionally with his fate and provide insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her dreams and beliefs as seen through his eyes, and so on. You'd mourn his death with her, growing more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you'd expect substance, not just the bare bones of the story: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you must provide that substance. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, continues*) Sometimes, it's tempting to rush through certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, and you know he used to be in the Air Force, now works nights at a gas station, was married twice, has no kids, enjoys fishing on weekends, dreams of owning the gas station, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nProvide the details.",
            "Well, let me tell you about the news from Columbus, Ohio. It's a bit grim, but here it goes. First off, there was a live broadcast on NBC 4 this morning, and the headline was about a guy named Shad Hostettler who had stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. They showed his mug shot, and he looked like pure evil. They spent only a couple of minutes on it, which I think was appropriate given that the story was still developing. The only details they gave were that he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I reckon they allocated a suitable amount of time to this news.\n\nNext up was a story about an 18-year-old, Travis Buyers, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, but no arrests had been made. The SWAT Team was looking into it. This story seemed quite brief, and I think that was probably because the victim was a black man, or from a black neighborhood. Now, I've noticed for years that minorities often get overlooked when they're crime victims. If it's a white person, the media goes crazy, but if it's a minority, it's lucky if it gets mentioned.\n\nFollowing that, the news covered a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. They mentioned the area where it might have happened and that the bullet was a .22 caliber from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers are offering five grand for tips leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThere was also a robbery story about a UDF on Clime Road. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. He was about six feet tall and weighed around 150 pounds. The news seemed to spend an unusual amount of time emphasizing his race.\n\nAnd finally, they reported on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was sentenced for conspiring to distribute marijuana in large quantities from Texas to Ohio. Instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years, they said \"300 months\". I'm not sure why that was, but they also mentioned he was Hispanic, which didn't seem particularly relevant to the story.",
            "There is a special tie between brothers, a bond so strong it can't be broken. This link carries with it a mix of feelings, like love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers understand each other in a way no one else can, and they often see themselves reflected in their sibling. It's in the direst of situations that this bond truly reveals itself, whether it's a force for good or ill. When these emotions surface, they come at a price. A part of understanding the feelings that stem from this fraternal bond is dealing with the fallout. When you look into your brother's eyes, you see not how others perceive you, but who you truly are. Your actions and their outcomes showcase your character. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers grapple with this theme and the emotions that come with it. Amidst a lush, vividly described setting, these two boys embark on a doomed journey. The story reaches its climax with Doodle facing death from his older brother's disappointment and pride. The theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist and his interactions with Doodle, as well as the narrator's perspective, which highlights the complex emotions the protagonist feels and his view of the world around him.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single key emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their tragic last adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearns for a brother who can learn all his skills, like holding his breath underwater, running, or climbing, or even racing to Horsehead Landing. But Doodle is frail, born with a weak heart, making it unlikely he'd survive such activities. The young protagonist's dreams shatter when he realizes Doodle can't fulfill these expectations. He even entertains thoughts of suffocating Doodle with a pillow, showing his anger and frustration. Yet, Doodle's smile can melt his heart, giving him hope. This indicates that his conviction may not have been strong. Deep down, he cares for his brother.",
            "The human brain is a complex and ingenious information-processing machine. As our technology has evolved from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. Keep in mind that these metaphors, while useful, have limitations and can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light into electrochemical signals. This information is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when you see a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines simple aspects like color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are to determine that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the initial decisions made during bottom-up processing to speed up your recognition, like identifying it as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\n\nOnce information is processed to a certain extent, an attention filter decides its importance and which cognitive processes should access it. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name in a noisy room. There are numerous stages of processing, and the results are continually refined by attention.\n\nThe brain must store information before processing it. Memory types include sensory, working, and long-term. Information is first encoded, with specific types of encoding for each sensory stimulus. Verbal input, for instance, can be encoded structurally (what the word looks like), phonemically (what it sounds like), or semantically (what it means). Once stored, information must be maintained. Animal studies suggest that working memory, which holds information for around 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained by the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are various models for how knowledge is organized in the brain, based on human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes a swipe at the looming threats of advanced technology and the capitalist system that supports it, painting a grim picture in Brave New World. The society values collective unity over individuality, with citizens brainwashed from birth to chase instant happiness. The populace is essentially puppets in a grand scheme, under the thumb of the World Controller, who dictates their every move. Looking at Brave New World through the lens of Marxism, one can't help but notice Huxley's reservations about these developments. Terms like homogenization and reification reinforce the idea that Huxley's novel is a critique of the flaws in society's economic structures of his time.\n\nCapitalism is openly mocked through the concept of false consciousness. Here, the common folk are blinded to the true nature of their economic standing, their interests solely driven by personal gain. This is the result of ideological control over the working class, which is clearly seen in the conditioning of Brave New World's citizens. The lower classes, like Delta and Gamma, lack their own will, with hypnopædia reinforcing a drive to consume and indulge, all manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, where a dominant group controls others, is evident here, with the lower classes unknowingly buying into the very system that oppresses them. Upper classes, while aware of this manipulation, do little to resist it, much like the few Alphas or Betas, such as Bernard, who simply accept their place. The interactions between social classes further illustrate the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nThere's no room for genuine relationships in Brave New World. Characters, even major ones, are one-dimensional, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley suggests that the rise of technology and capitalism strips us of our free will and expression. Emotions are kept shallow, with men discussing women primarily based on their physical characteristics, and women openly talking about their encounters. The societal classes' contentment with their status indicates the socioeconomic impact of capitalism, reflecting Marxist views on the proletariat, who are falsely made to believe their superiority through their continued consumption and obedience.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for a couple of years now, which means I've spent a good chunk of my college life navigating the sprawling campus. During my freshman year, I was stuck in the East Halls dorms, which were tucked away in the far east corner of campus. Walking to classes scattered across campus, like the Willard building near the center, could take up to 25 minutes, especially when the weather was bad. I got the scoop from an alumni that not long ago, the campus was much bigger, with vast empty plots of land that have since been filled with sports fields and new buildings like the Creamery and health services facility. As the campus continues to grow, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. The solution? Cycling, of course. But bikes alone won't solve the problem. Students need to adopt them, and the campus must be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nI had a chat with a friend who recently picked up cycling after a long break. He marveled at how great bikes are and wondered why he had ever stopped. \"They’re the best way to get around,\" he said, \"especially when you're short on time and need to save energy.\" Biking doesn't just benefit your body; it's also the most efficient mode of transport. A simple bowl of oatmeal and a little exercise can take you 30 miles or more. Currently, I live off campus, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest move I made this year was buying a bike. Every day, I have classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my place, which cuts down to 5 minutes on a bike if I pedal fast. The only hiccup is that Pollock Road, the direct route to Thomas, isn't always easy to navigate, whether on bike or foot. Walking has its merits, but with my busy schedule, it's a luxury I can't afford. If I didn't have a bike, walking would be my only option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily commute. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add that to all the other time I'd spend walking to other classes, appointments, and so on—that’s more time than I can spare."
