            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "So, in my journey towards an education in social work, I've got a clear path in mind. I aim to serve the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on assisting children who've been abused or neglected, and providing support to troubled families. The values I bring to this field are service, respect, a strong ethical nature, a commitment to enhancing relationships between others, and a dedication to growing professionally to stay competent. These values aren't just essential for social workers; they're integral to who I am personally.\n\nI've always desired to help others, but the career path wasn't clear. Through high school and college, I witnessed individuals avoid problems in denial and use less-than-ideal coping mechanisms. Seeing this, I chose a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, unsure of my career path. One summer, a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy fleeing his abusive parents. The next day, he called the police. I drove to his house to check if I could help and talked to the parents about their son's situation. They seemed nervous and blamed their son's \"manipulative\" behavior. This experience made me consider a career in social work to support children in similar family disputes.\n\nAnother crucial value for social work is social justice. Society claims the individual is important, yet we often strive to be like \"everyone else.\" This isn't unique individualism. Throughout school, I protested against social injustice: coloring my hair, dressing to express myself, piercing my ears beyond traditional norms, being open about my involvement with GSBA, and fighting against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will continue to stand against injustice.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the sleep disorder insomnia. The Biological model delves into inherited genetic information and medical aspects of health, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental relationships and their impacts on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review of insomnia examines these models and discusses each piece of research to better explain them. The strengths and weaknesses of the research findings are also critiqued.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized as a Primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while those related to another mental disorder are linked to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other categories include sleep disorders caused by medical complications or substance intake. Dyssomnias like Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS), and Parasomnias such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified, define these disorders. The review focuses primarily on insomnia and the broader topic of primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.",
            "This essay explores Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, from three angles: its definition, diagnosis, and how educators can assist students with CAPD in mainstream classrooms.\n\nCAPD is a condition where the central nervous system struggles to process auditory information effectively. This doesn't mean individuals with CAPD are hearing impaired; rather, their brains have difficulty translating sounds into meaningful information. People with CAPD can hear normally but may struggle to distinguish words from background noise.\n\nCAPD has been studied since the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception.\" Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began testing children with communicative disorders in 1954, and Kimura introduced dichotic testing in 1961. A 1977 conference further spurred research on CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways, such as difficulty in locating sounds, distinguishing between acoustic events, recognizing sound patterns, or differentiating changes in speech. Individuals with CAPD may also struggle to synthesize sound cues and determine the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves observing the patient's listening behavior or performance on auditory function tests, which can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. No single test exists for a conclusive diagnosis, and the cause of CAPD remains unknown. Common tests include presenting multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and asking the patient to identify certain items. Advanced tests may involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses.\n\nTeachers in mainstream classrooms can play a significant role in assisting students with CAPD. They can help by creating a calm, quiet environment, clearly stating instructions, and ensuring the student receives preferential seating. Visual aids and repetition can also be beneficial, as can breaking tasks into smaller, manageable parts.",
            "Another month has come and gone, and not much has changed in my life. But there's one thing I want to talk about. I finally finished the beta version of the tradenet website, after a lot of dragging my feet. It's been a process of adding and improving, and I think I'm going to register a domain and get it online by the middle of January. The delay was due to a lack of funds and a way to transfer it to the web hosting company. My partner will get his credit card in January, so that's when we'll set it up. And of course, I also flunked accounting. I knew I was close to failing, but I didn't think I'd actually flunk. I put in an appeal to the course coordinator, but I don't have high hopes. On the bright side, I got distinctions for law and economics. I guess if you enjoy a course, you're more motivated to do well in it. But then, you enjoy a course when it's easy to understand. Hmm, a catch 22 situation. Anyway, I'll get the appeal result this week. I'm hoping for the best. Otherwise, nothing much happened.\n\nNow, about the other big thing that's been going on. I have this affliction called shyness. When I talk to strangers, especially those of the opposite sex, I turn into jelly. I can't think, I start to tremble, and I just freeze up. It happened today at the YEN meeting. I had to tell Genevieve I hadn't gotten the club mailing list invitation yet. I thought it would be easy, but it wasn't. I care too much about what others think of me, and my brain shuts down. She tried to be nice, but I didn't react well to it. I hope I didn't look like a dweeb. But I'm working on it. One of the main reasons I joined YEN is to force myself into situations where I have to interact with strangers, especially those from the opposite gender. If I want to get anywhere in life, I can't do it on my own. It's not so bad with people I know well, but there's still a fear inside me. That's why I've never had the nerve to get into any relationship. It's frustrating to want something so badly but be too afraid to reach out and get it. No matter what happens, I will overcome this 'disability,' if you will. And the only way to do that is through increased interaction. The other problem I have is positive thinking, which affects my motivation. It's all my parents' fault. Especially my mom. She's so negative all the time. It might seem unfilial to say this, but it's true. She comes from a society and upbringing that isn't generally known for achievements. Now she's passed it on to me. But the positive thing is, now that I'm aware of this shortcoming, I can work towards eliminating it. I Have to be smart about it.\n\nI talked to the YEN guy I met through Darren. I can't remember his name. He's a total 'Adam Knoo' convert. It might be unwise to turn evangelical for anything, but in this case, it's positive. He made me realize how negative my thoughts have been lately. How small I've been thinking. So negative I'm disgusted with myself. I will stop using the word 'try' and use the word 'MUST.' It's amazing how much difference a word and thought makes in your life. So I MUST come up with a study and work schedule on Sunday and I MUST follow through with that schedule. There! That's settled then. A paradigm shift in actions and thought.\n\nWell, Kings has gotten himself a girlfriend. Wouldn't have thought that would happen anytime soon. But life can sometimes blindside you when you least expect it. So there it is. My kemosabe in bachelorhood arms has deserted me. Can't say I blame him though. Except the reason for him to get together with this girl is rather suspect. I'll never be sure whether he got together with her just to prove to himself that he could get a girlfriend or that he's really sincerely into this girl. Only way to find out is to just ask him directly, but that would just make our friendship take a weird turn. Oh well.\n\nSo, onto something else. Been a long while since I added any new entries. But hot damn! Lazy bones strikes again. Sometimes I wonder why I bothered to have a blog in the first place. Well, it's the school holidays now. Finished the exams. I hope to pass all four papers. Anyway, the accounts paper was a bust. Same feeling as the stats paper last semester. Probably gonna flunk accounts. But there's always a chance I'll pass, right? Well, tomorrow, or I should say today, I'm gonna go down to the registry of companies and I'm gonna register a business partnership with Kumar. It's been a long time coming. Gonna call the new company 'Epac Trading Company' in honour of the earlier supposed but on hold partnership with the other two future partners for Entrepac. Well, we'll see what happens tomorrow then. Oh and I'm working on tradenet now. Damn I loathe programming. But I gave my word that I'll do it and I don't like to break it. Though sometimes there are extenuating circumstances. Heck, there's always an excuse not to do something, right?\n\nI just read this article, specifically the section referring to the remarks made by Bill Cosby. In it he talks about the culture of victimism in America. This got me to think about the culture of victimism in the civilised world as we know it today. I get tired when I hear people blaming everything but themselves for their less than desired life situations. Or saying it's meant to be. In my humble opinion, unless you are mentally incapacitated, you, and only you, are responsible for the life you lead. There is no two ways about it. What's the point of blaming everything for your troubles? Why not get off your ass and do something about it? I'd like to think that I am doing so through actively taking actions that have a specific life goal in mind. You can't go anywhere if you don't have anywhere you want to go to. So I suppose the key is that you should decide upon a goal that you want to strive towards. But it's not just goal setting that's important. It must be with a sense of discipline that you work towards your goal with. Though that by no means guarantees success, success cannot be achieved otherwise.\n\nSlept at 10 last night. That's something I haven't done in such a long time. I actually can't remember the last time I went to bed before midnight. There's just so many better things to do than sleep. Guess it finally caught up with me. Woke up at half past 11 the next morning. A good 13 1/2 hours of sleep. Funnily enough, it wasn't as refreshing as I would have thought it would have been. I could actually stay awake throughout the lecture today. Can't say the same thing about paying attention though. That's what getting enough Zs can do for you. I must study econ tomorrow. Yes. Must. That's the power of suggestion. Saying and thinking are two totally different things when you turn them into action. Saying that you MUST instead of saying that you will TRY. Now I know. So I MUST complete the first three topics tomorrow. Not that I've got any better things to do. Yes, I know it's ambitious considering my procrastinative past. But I MUST do it. After all, I am answering it MYSELF. And lying to yourself is far worse than lying to anyone else, wouldn't you agree?\n\nWell, it's a week and a half till the next semester begins. Man, the holidays flew past in a blink of an eye, didn't they? This is probably the last holiday that I will have to just laze around and do pretty much nothing. The next holiday, at the end of this year, I'll probably be busy with the DPP project (one big mother of a research project) and with the starting up of the tuition centre. The following holiday, during mid 2005, I'll be in Melbourne at RMIT, for most of that month. So that doesn't leave much time for breathers in between. Phew! From here on out, it'll be one mad rush. And that's just the beginning of life then. I look toward it with mixed feelings really. On one hand, it'll be great to be able to start earning my keep. But on the other hand, I don't want to leave the security of school so soon. But time marches on. And there is nothing anyone can do about it. All I can do is to face it head on and hope that life doesn't chew me up and spit me out. But that's just being pessimistic. Remember the glass is half full!\n\nWell, I was just in one of my rhetoric moods just now. I was thinking of how sad it was that good friends can grow apart as you grow up. You gain new perspectives as you grow and those might now be the same as your friends. Like you're in different realities. Sometimes you grow apart because of differing views and sometimes it's because of circumstances. Some of which are not under your control but most of which are. Things like gaining new ideological beliefs, new social groups or just something as simple as getting a new job. Any of which can cause you to not make contact as often as you would like. I used to believe that it was their fault for not keeping in touch. But then I realized that I was as much at fault as anyone else in my life. People walk in and walk out of your life. You can try to keep them from walking out but ultimately, it's their choice. Guess that's why you have to choose your friends carefully. But then again, if you are too guarded in your choices, you might be artificially restricting yourself. Ah the choices we all make. I've had many good people in my life. It's sad to reminisce on the good times past as you know the chances of regaining those times are slim to none. So there's no use dwelling on them. But you don't want to discount their value in helping to shape you into the person that you are today. And yet, you don't want to let them hold you back from becoming the person that you're going to be tomorrow. Sigh.\n\nThis doesn't happen much when you're a teenager but it starts when you reach adulthood. You wish to be as carefree as you were then. Letting your parents worry for you. Reality was just for other people. You lived in a cocoon, in your own world. Ah the good old days.",
            "Well, another tale of German colonial rule to ponder upon. We all know how infamous it was for its cruelty, with the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in South West Africa being a stark testament. But let's not oversimplify things. The German colonial empire was as varied as the lands it conquered, with diverse policies and ruling styles. Educational provision followed suit, with significant differences across colonies. Now, when the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a well-educated African population to their surprise. Similarly, German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were met with praise by contemporary authors.\n\nBut you know what was quite different? South West Africa, now Namibia. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a crucial role in schooling natives, the natives' education was mostly left to missionary societies with limited government support. The Europeans, however, got the royal treatment - state schools were established, and missionary schools were heavily supported and regulated. These policies had long-lasting effects on Namibia, even after the Germans were gone. Other German colonies had literate Africans, but in Namibia, the majority remained uneducated and illiterate.\n\nWhy the stark contrast? Social, political, and economic factors played a huge part. This paper wants to delve into these factors, focusing on new research on how settlers and colonial authorities viewed the native Africans.\n\nResearch on colonial education is vast, with many sources in German from the early twentieth century. These works aimed to describe educational systems. Later English studies compared and analyzed these systems, highlighting significant differences. Cohen's work on education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly notable, comparing the two colonies and discussing the factors behind their differences. The large settler population in South West Africa, Cohen argues, explains many differences in its educational system.\n\nNow, let's talk climate. South West Africa had a moderately pleasant climate, with many desert areas. This hospitable environment attracted a significant European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived there, while East Africa, the next largest settler colony, had only 5,336.",
            "So, let's talk about the evolution of popular music over the past century. Popular music has grown into a sprawling landscape with so many genres that it's tough to list them all. But let's zero in on one of the most diverse and expressive genres: Heavy Metal. This genre has been around for about 40 years and has spawned a plethora of sub and sub-sub genres, each with its unique sound. Heavy Metal is known for its wide range of emotions, mainly leaning towards the darker side of the spectrum. It's diverse and flexible, allowing musicians to create their own niches and sub-genres.\n\nToday, the Heavy Metal scene is chock-full of different groups, making it hard to pin down exactly what Heavy Metal is. It's difficult to understand the current metal music landscape without first grasping what the Heavy Metal movement is and why it's more than just a genre.",
            "A few decades before the Surrealists started painting their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, captures not only a woman in awe of her dreamland but also Rousseau’s own personal aspirations as an artist. Since he started his journey, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet faced a tough internal dilemma: whether to conform to or mimic certain painting styles to gain acceptance or to remain creatively independent and unique. The Dream is Rousseau’s magnum opus that best reflects his career-long struggle to choose between these two paths.\n\nTo understand The Dream through this lens, one must first delve into Rousseau’s biography. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed bourgeois prosperity. Unlike his peers, Rousseau didn’t receive formal art training; instead, he worked as a gabelou—a municipal toll service employee—until the age of forty. He was known as douanier, a customs inspector. The death of his first wife, Clémence, followed by the loss of eight infant children left Rousseau with only one daughter, Julia, and deep grief. Painting became his refuge and fresh start.\n\nRousseau’s desire for art world acceptance is understandable given his context. He was uneducated in formal painting and began late in life, working alongside other talented but more famous artists. He longed for recognition like Matisse, but their motivations differed. Matisse feared painting tritely, while Rousseau sought a conventional style to be admitted to the Artiste Français.",
            "Many a great thinker has pondered the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there's a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats asserts in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience. Yet, we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being formally taught in these ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are attempts to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are usually efforts to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than rules for creating or judging good art or moral behavior.\n\nCritiquing art or morals often falls short of capturing their essence. For instance, a discussion about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might revolve around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't explain why it's considered good art. Often, when asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people say, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more complex explanation. Both art and morals can't be fully reduced to their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics shares this transcendental nature. As Wittgenstein suggests, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. /\" It's this \"je ne sais quoi,\" this ineffable quality, that makes both art and morality so powerful and links them together.\n\nI believe morality and art are closely related because we experience them most deeply at a noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They affect us at a level we can experience but not fully explain. This connection is strongest in literature. As McKean states, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Today's Germany stands tall as a united nation, with a unique cultural fusion that stretches from the foothills of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This rich cultural tapestry is felt from Cologne by the Rhine, through the heart of Germany, to the Elbe's banks in the Saxon city of Dresden. Given this unique heritage, it's not surprising that modern Germany is a blend of diverse origins and tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a name shrouded in debate among scholars and historians. While Tacitus believed the name stemmed from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, and others argue it derived from a Gallic word or an Old Irish word, 'garim' meaning 'to shout', the exact origin remains uncertain. For instance, Tacitus wrote in his AD 98 work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", that he considered the Germans to be indigenous and not mixed with other races. He further noted that no one would willingly leave the warmth of Rome for the harsh climate and tough ways of Germania unless it was their home. Indeed, as the Germanic tribes started appearing in the mid-first century, they lived on the empire's borders, trading goods and skills with the Romans. The Romans would occasionally send expeditions to these lands, but they usually returned to their vast empire, leaving the Germanic tribes to live on the frontier.",
            "Downwards, I stared, my mind blankly comprehending the view before me. Silent, unemotionally, my practiced awareness studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding. Thoughts slipped in and out almost faster than they appeared, my consciousness working so smoothly and cleanly that it felt like I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. Once, following advice from an artist I worked with, I bought an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I'd wanted to learn how to draw since I was six, and this book teaches everything from understanding a pencil to processes the brain uses to interpret lines. One technique it teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study, transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture into an easily grasped one. Staring down at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally project that artist’s frame. I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment. Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown. Fingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightening and relaxing as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness. Muscles tightened, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxiously the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again. The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet. Mop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "So, another year is coming to a close, and let me tell you, it's been more than a little bit of a shock. Teenagers are dying behind the wheel, and it's a grim reality that's been building for some time. The National Institutes of Health has been saying it all along: the teen brain just isn't ready for the dangers of driving, and that inexperience is at the root of it all. Not only does this lead to more accidents, but it also increases the risk of rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. And when you add in the fact that teens often drive with their peers—because, let's face it, that's how they roll—well, it's a perfect storm of disaster.\n\nSeveral states have tried to put a stop to this with temporary provisional licenses that limit driving hours and prohibit other teens as passengers. But let me tell you, these are just Band-Aid solutions. The issue is that, as a group, the youngest drivers just aren't equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities. Even seasoned psychologists like Marvin Zuckerman think that 18 is too young to issue a regular driver's license. USA Today reports that he's done research showing that teens under 19-20 are still on a high-risk thrill-seeking streak. It makes sense then to delay driving until that tendency starts to level out. If we keep giving licenses to young teens now, we're setting ourselves up for a whole lot of tragedy in the upcoming years. By 2010, the Baby Boomer's babies will be ready to hit the road, and millions of new teen drivers will be on the streets.\n\nWhat we need is straightforward legislation. Schools could keep teaching driver's education, but no one under 18 could be driving a car. A provisional permit could still be issued, and a set number of practical training hours would be required. California, for instance, currently requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Since this is a problem that affects teens across the country, uniform, national legislation would be a sensible and effective way to protect teens everywhere.\n\nNow, this idea isn't exactly new, but it's time for action. We can't keep looking the other way while our teens are dying behind the wheel. It's time for a change.",
            "So I decided to take a look at the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films. I wanted to check out all of the trick films, which numbered fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films are known for their creative editing techniques used to create illusions. My study mainly involved describing the poetics of most trick films and looking at the unique traits in a few of the later ones. Most of these films were set-bound, using a frontal proscenium, and had no camera movement. Typically, long and medium shots were employed, and each trick film was composed of one shot. However, some films from the early 1900s dared to break these rules by including multiple shots.\n\nOne common feature among these trick films is their filming within an interior set, framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera doesn't move from its proscenium position to follow characters or objects. This style was heavily influenced by theatre and vaudeville and magic acts. One example is Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right and move back and forth horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera doesn't follow them. This composition led to shots being long and medium in nature, borrowing from theatre traditions where the audience views the entire performance within the stage's borders. Actors seldom moved towards the camera, so close-ups weren't used.\n\nTrick films typically follow the rule of one conceptual shot equaling a single film, limiting their length to about a minute or less. This also restricted their dramatic or narrative usage, with most focusing on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts with little story. However, in trick films, a conceptual shot might consist of several physical shots joined together to create illusions of apparition or disappearing, like in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). A careful watch reveals the moment when the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” starts, though the film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor from Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republicanism. Despite being primarily an agriculturalist and having a short career in politics, he was renowned for his commitment and outspoken nature in matters of personal liberty and governance. His dedication to agriculture and his political experiences shaped his strong opinions on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the United States as having a unique chance to establish an ideal system, as there were no native traditions to hinder its creators. He believed in the innate rights of man and their interdependence, arguing that if one right was denied, all would fail, and the remaining rights would be less valuable. These rights, he thought, should be outside the government's reach. He believed that a \"state of nature\" allowed the powerful and cunning to thrive, but in a society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must acknowledge the inherent good and evil within humanity. He was rigid in his belief that morality was dualistic, asserting, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He defined good principles as those that protected private property, promoted agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. A government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its leaders, who would inevitably be driven by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, Taylor believed, was a powerful force but only became evil when it led to sub-societies exploiting others. A good government, he argued, was needed to control man's natural evil and should be closely monitored to prevent the adoption of harmful principles.\n\nLike many Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers than explicitly stated. He recognized that an extensive Federal government could be expensive and potentially oppressive. However, he believed that a strict, literal interpretation could become corrupt without considering the intent of the founders. Furthermore, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Well, another month has gone by, and I have a whole bunch of stuff to talk about that happened. First off, take a look at Figure 17, and you'll see a noticeable drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of our project. That's a bit of a bummer because I'm not sure why that happened. I mean, it’s New England, so the weather could be a factor with people not commuting by bike or on foot due to the cold. Also, it's the end of the fall semester, so everyone's heads are down doing schoolwork or processing grades. And December brings the holiday season, so some folks might have just forgotten about filling out the commuter log. Plus, classes don't resume until late January, and that could also account for the low numbers in February. But none of that explains the February dip. It's possible that projects like this start with a lot of energy and excitement, which naturally wears off over time. To counteract this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March to give the project a boost, and it did help increase log submissions. So, we faced the challenge of keeping the momentum going, especially with the holiday and semester breaks that are common in higher education. Another hurdle is that people just really enjoy driving their cars, which is deeply ingrained in our culture. To get folks interested in alternative commuting, we handed out a ton of gift certificates to all sorts of places like local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. We even considered giving away bicycles or hybrid cars, which could have helped combat that dip in engagement. The prizes we offered were pretty solid at first, but if we had announced bigger prizes like bikes or hybrid cars throughout the project, it might have kept participation higher. For instance, announcing a bike giveaway in December and a hybrid or electric car giveaway in January could have increased engagement instead of it decreasing.",
            "So here's a quick rundown on ETFs. An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that mirrors an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but it's more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. You get the diversification of an index fund and the perks of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, or purchase as few as one share in any transaction. These benefits are quite appealing, but ETFs typically have lower expense ratios than average mutual funds. The downside is you have to pay a commission for any trades involving ETFs, just like with stock orders. Another upside is the wide variety of funds available. But hey, it's always good to check if these stated benefits, like diversification, actually materialize and to what extent. For now, let's look at the ETF IHF and compare it against its top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of all assets in the ETF. Below are these top 10 holdings and their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can normalize the current % of assets to 100% and calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio’s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks, in the proportion they have in the ETF. Here are the calculations:\n\nFrom this chart, it's clear that a portfolio consisting of only the top 10 holdings has a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, which is a 16% increase. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. So, it looks like a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could yield higher returns with a lower Beta. However, these two portfolios might not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios are indeed statistically different, we need to calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's standout poems is \"Dream-Land.\" In this work, he employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced back by Mabbott to Virgil. Virgil utilized the term for an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world. While Virgil did indeed use the term, there's a more contemporary source to which some credit should be given. Poe was particularly captivated by German authors.\n\nThis is notable as it reveals Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" discusses the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe was likely imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was famous for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within Faust's second part lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" In this piece, a king loses his wife after she gives him a goblet. Upon his wife's passing, he becomes a heavy drinker and mourns, eventually deciding it is time for him to die. He bestows his possessions on his children, except for the goblet, which he throws into the ocean before dying. The King of Thule and the description in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, possibly serving as a dark reflection of Poe's own struggles and reliance on drinking as a coping mechanism. Faust was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, only a year before Poe’s use of the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe mentions \"ultma Thule\" once in his collected works, but he uses the term \"Thule\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" bookending the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be considered companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule, a dark and lonely place haunted by dead friends, and sees a world shaded without color. These scenes echo \"The King of Thule\" by Goethe, as the king is in mourning, lonely, and has lost the will to rule or live. The entire poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a significant writer whose work Poe would have known, not only through his admiration for Tennyson but also through the many reproductions of his works after their original publication.",
            "Under California law, could a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by proving the store manager acted with malice? Specifically, the manager was informed twice about the spill but failed to clean it for half an hour because he was having dinner. A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's punitive damage claim outright. To succeed, she must show that the manager's actions were willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm, and that the actions were despicable. Palmer could argue that the manager should have known about the probable harm since multiple customers were injured from slipping before her accident. She might also claim that the manager's failure to address the spill was despicable, considering there were already six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed the manager about the applesauce spill. The manager responded that he was on dinner break and didn't have time to deal with it. Another employee notified the manager about the spill at 5:15 pm, and the manager gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D Markets in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages, and we are considering filing a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. In California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have considered conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of their conduct and deliberately failed to avoid them.",
            "So, four years ago, I enrolled in a CBC course on Islam. The main topic of debate in the class was whether Islam is inherently hostile. I find this question more pertinent now than ever, given the shift in mass media's perception of Islam post-9/11. In 2001, I couldn’t have imagined a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with a Muslim background, becoming a reality in America. It’s fascinating how the media’s view has swung from hostility to extreme tolerance.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography piqued my interest. According to historical accounts, Muhammad’s rise to power and the spread of Islam contradict the image of him portrayed in the biography. I've always heard that Muhammad forced conversions, conquering tribes and imposing Islam upon them. However, the biography presents him as a humble martyr, misunderstood and even humbled. People slowly came to recognize the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nThere are striking parallels between Muhammad's 'miracles' and Jesus' ministry. For instance, Muhammad multiplied a small amount of mutton and milk to feed forty men, a feat reminiscent of Jesus' own miracle. This style of writing makes Muhammad seem like a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles. This downplays the miracle and life of Jesus, making it seem like Muhammad is being used to take credit for Jesus' life and personhood.\n\nMoreover, the biography often presents stories of self-proclaimed converts to Islam, illustrating that they 'found the truth' on their own. However, many of these accounts are third-hand, with the author relaying stories heard from others. I find this method unconvincing because it makes the stories seem less credible and more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most is how the biography elevates Muhammad, depicting him as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man. However, historical records show Muhammad was not as gentle and humble as presented. I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus, as he held them during his lifetime, were swiftly set aside in the evolution of Christian thought following his life. If we observe this historical trajectory in broad terms, we notice a pattern of Christianity straying increasingly from its origins. Today, the world exhibits a growing awareness and unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditionalists persist and resist any thinking beyond what they've been taught, this segment of the population might not have a substantial impact on the whole. Among Christians, historical awareness will significantly increase in future years. There will be a rising desire to differentiate the doctrines that have been added to Christianity over time from Jesus' original intentions. This process may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable: a reversal in the trend of Christian history. A movement will grow in numbers, peeling away layers of doctrine, as if the clock were turning backward, until only the core of Jesus' teachings remain. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing the masses to worship as they did in Jesus' time, adhering solely to his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to guide the way. However, as the theological clock moves backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity within Christendom will reverse into greater uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions, we'll see increasing similarities. Human history is filled with such reversals. For instance, Christians were once persecuted, shunned, and killed by the Roman Empire, but later the empire itself became a Christian institution. Our nation has moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play out in the realm of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source and reducing diversity in the process. What's more, it will become common to read Jesus' words metaphorically, not as literal statements. So, what changed since Jesus' lifetime?\n\nLooking back through history, we find that Judaism was the theological foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, the belief in a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were all central to the religion by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not united. They were divided into factions like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots, with the majority being ordinary people.",
            "Another text that illustrates the inherent greed and self-centeredness of people is \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair. This novel reveals how, at their core, humans are driven to prioritize their own interests and comfort, often neglecting those less fortunate. The owners and directors of the massive factories in the story exemplify this; their sole focus is on expanding their businesses regardless of the consequences. Sinclair uses vivid imagery to depict the detrimental effects of this unchecked power, describing the factories as \"a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" with \"great chimneys\" spewing smoke and \"massive\" piles of animal waste. The workers are also subjected to harsh conditions, with employers prioritizing profits over their employees' well-being. With minimal legal protections and worker representation, the environment is akin to a system of slavery, with workers \"dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "Fitzgerald employs various techniques to evoke certain feelings or attitudes in his readers regarding crucial themes in \"The Great Gatsby.\" Some of these approaches are more potent than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes a mix of adjective-noun pairings and symbolism in his novel to achieve this. He pairs seemingly mismatched adjectives and nouns to create a specific atmosphere around certain subjects. For instance, he often uses color to convey deeper meanings. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald assigns symbolic significance to colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. He builds up these meanings and then later uses them to evoke feelings around key objects.\n\nWhite and gray are significant colors in Fitzgerald's novel. White symbolizes elegance and refinement, while gray represents aging and fading. He reinforces these meanings throughout the story. Daisy and Jordan wear white frequently, as do other characters in various scenes. For example, when Nick attends Gatsby’s party, he observes that people are dressed in white flannels, while Tom is seen in a white shirt when he meets Myrtle. Notably, only when Nick gets impressions of Gatsby’s party do people not wear white, suggesting a shift in importance. Common or unimportant subjects are also described in these colors: Nick travels “down the white chasms of lower New York,” and people at Gatsby’s party have “gray names.” Even mundane characters and settings are described in this way, such as Jordan and Daisy’s “white girlhood,” the “gray cars” and “gray land” in the valley of ashes, and the “gray” Italian child in the railroad.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald establishes the meanings of white/gray, he uses them to underscore unimportance or uniformity. This technique starts with Daisy. After a prolonged period without noticeable use of these colors, Daisy is described as wearing white in a white roadster. This description signals to readers that Daisy is less of a central character and more of a uniform addition to the story, someone Gatsby longs for. Fitzgerald uses similar descriptions of Daisy to reinforce this impression, such as her “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” and her white dress during the encounter between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County is a hot spot for agriculture due to its warm, sunny climate. The region is known for growing tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a thriving market for organic, community-supported agriculture, with many local groups having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also highly sought after in the San Diego area. Many organic farms offer tours and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching, thereby allowing the landowner to enjoy the benefits of government programs while enhancing biodiversity and creating additional income streams. This type of operation not only fills a potentially profitable niche but also promotes a healthier environment by reducing chemical use, which in turn boosts both plant and wildlife diversity.\n\nHowever, organic farming comes with its own set of challenges. It demands more intensive labor for pest control, weed management, and soil fertilization without chemicals. Furthermore, it can be less efficient and more costly than conventional farming, with smaller farms lacking the economies of scale. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, like planting cover crops or managing grazing rotation, can also increase labor costs. For these reasons, a landowner in this scenario might consider seeking financial assistance or expert advice to optimize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land in question is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It's a mix of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan currently identifies over a hundred plant and animal species, including several endangered ones like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as species that may soon be listed as declining.\n\nHistorically, the land was inhabited by Native Americans and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This parcel was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and wood production over many decades. I selected this property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see how a small farmer might reduce costs and maintain wildlife-friendly farming practices. As a model, I looked at an organic farm in the same area.",
            "So another month has gone by, and once again, I find myself reflecting on how culture plays a substantial role in any negotiation. Culture, you see, is not a monolith, but rather a living thing that's as much about what it is not as what it is. It's not singular, uniform, or homogenous. Saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are oversimplifications, though understanding those generalizations can be beneficial. But it's far more practical for a negotiator to focus on how the culture's attitudes and values will impact the negotiations at hand. When encountering a foreign culture, it's natural to compare it to our own, which can present its own set of challenges.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" The preceding quotation is found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and it serves as the opening point for St. Anselm's argument regarding the existence of God. A similar belief is held by another author we will discuss, St. Thomas Aquinas. Since both arguments argue for the existence of the same divine entity, our task is to determine whose argument is more compelling. For the sake of conciseness, we'll assume they're both correct in their belief in the biblical God. To explore their arguments fairly, we must consider a specific concept of God, as their defenses are tailored to that.\n\nStarting with St. Anselm's basic argument, he suggests that understanding God begins with faith and self-reflection. He posits that because God's existence is inherent in our understanding, we cannot imagine Him not existing. While his concept can be somewhat obscure and complicated, the core idea is that God's proof lies within our own minds. We don't need external evidence; instead, we discover the truth about God through introspection. This is often referred to within Christianity as faith.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, however, argues that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without requiring faith. This approach could be advantageous for evangelism, as it would allow for the persuasion of new converts based solely on logic. Aquinas presents five logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates that God's existence is logically necessary.",
            "So, way back in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a man was born who would later come to be known as Buddha. After a life of renouncing the world, he attained enlightenment, and his teachings spread, eventually leading to the formation of Buddhism—the most traditional branch of which is called Theravada Buddhism. This religion is now around twenty-five hundred years old, and it's changed a lot since Buddha's time. For instance, in Sri Lanka, where Theravada Buddhism is practiced, the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Though Buddha never taught about such festivities, monks and laypeople alike participate, highlighting how the religion has evolved. These changes can be seen in everything from surface-level traditions to the very core of the religion's teachings. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time due to both internal and external influences, some hostile and some benign.\n\nThere are some key terms we'll use often in this discussion: internal versus external, and hostile versus benign. Internal forces are those that come from within the Buddhist community, no matter the monastic status. External forces are anything from outside the community. A hostile force is anything that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community, often due to a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force, on the other hand, doesn't mean to harm or help the community—though it might end up doing so.\n\nFirst, let's look at the basics of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially made up of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka sets out the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, like Anatta (no self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Only by understanding these concepts can one escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. This escape also involves the elimination of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), when one becomes enlightened.\n\nIn the Vinaya Pitaka, there are rules for laypeople and monks alike. Laypeople follow the Five Precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). Monks have many more rules to follow. The most fundamental teaching in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, life is suffering (Dukkha). Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico once shared a 57-year rivalry, from 1836 to 1893, with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 being the peak of their rivalry. This period saw many skirmishes before the First World War, with disputes often stemming from differences in religion, culture, and traditions, as well as competing material interests. Many nations with shared borders face similar situations, with David M. Pletcher noting that only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting, overarching American diplomatic problems. These nations are close geographically to the United States and have historically been rivals, while others in Latin America have maintained better relations. Religious differences, like those between the United States and Mexico, have caused rifts throughout history, similar to the ideological struggles during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Diehl and Goerts list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during this period, with most being territorial issues related to border raids and frontier problems. Schmitt explains that the rivalry began to ease as Mexico grew more dependent on the United States, and it ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I had never known existed. Prior to this, I was a nurse, having chosen this profession out of a strong desire for the stability and security I lacked as a child. The phrase, \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick,\" echoed through my adolescence and beyond, guiding me towards nursing. Despite my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist, I found solace in the predictability of my chosen profession.\n\nYet, here I am: 46 years old, single, and unable to work, with no savings and living on Social Security Disability. After 15 years, I have nothing to call my own. Every day is a struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing is certain anymore, but one thing is clear: I could not have survived this long without the help of my family and a few good friends. When disaster strikes, you feel weak, no matter how strong you are.\n\nMy point is that life, both big and small, presents emergencies. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well you prepare, some things are too vast to overcome alone. While I agree that we should reduce our reliance on big government, I believe in the power of community. We should relearn to trust and help each other rather than each of us building our own fallout shelters.\n\nConservatives often praise \"rugged individualism\" as the nation's backbone, but our forefathers' resilience was built on compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. Pioneers crossing the Rockies didn't make it alone; they traveled in wagon trains, supporting each other.\n\nSo, yes, be prepared. I have a disaster kit, including first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and flashlights. But while you're preparing, get to know your neighbors. Trust and community are just as important as personal preparedness.",
            "So, why do organisms evolve as they do? Are there any restrictions or constraints that dictate the direction of evolutionary change? Back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson had this to say: \"Even now, the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" Yet, we find ourselves still grappling with the same question today. Fortunately, mathematical modeling has made strides in understanding various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, both through ontogeny and phylogeny. Our research explores how these mathematical models, combined with experimental studies, can shed light on the mechanisms driving the direction and scale of evolutionary-change in Prunum. We've utilized X-radiographic images of Prunum species to quantify parameters that can be used to model both hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell. We then modeled hypothetical shell morphologies to interpret possible morphological changes in Prunum, merging these results with experimental and descriptive studies to better grasp macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a structure that winds around through 360 degrees of space over time. These turns, or whorls, spiral around an imaginary central axis, the columella, which runs through the shell's central column. The rate at which these whorls enlarge varies, and the continuous line separating each whorl is called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last, with the apex at the top and the base at the bottom. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual orientation is the apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical side and determine where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts, and count from this line, estimating each whorl to a quarter of a full turn.\n\nA shell can also be seen as a series of apertures that traverse time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be tracked via the coordinates of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a formulation is created, parameters can be varied to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Well, I've been watching the stats on neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia for a while now, and it seems like there's barely been any progress over the last decade. While the country's on a good track to meet certain Millennium Development Goals, like water and sanitation, we're falling short on child and maternal health. There are a bunch of reasons why, and it seems like we need to focus more on strengthening the overall health system instead of just tweaking individual programs.\n\nWe've seen a decent improvement in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% meeting the target. But a lot of these are just traditional workers like midwives, who can't handle complicated pregnancies, leading to a lot of maternal deaths from things like hemorrhage. So, these improvements are a bit misleading, and we still have a lot of work to do. Plus, the percentage of children under five getting treatment for diarrhea has gone down, and data on postnatal care is all over the place.\n\nCesarean-section rates are still lower than they should be, around 4%, and there's a big gap between urban and rural rates. This shows that healthcare access is mainly focused on cities. And there's a huge gap in service use between the poorest and richest people, which is likely due to high out-of-pocket costs. So, we need to ask ourselves how to best tackle these issues. Should we focus on specific programs or strengthen the health system as a whole? There are pros and cons to both approaches.\n\nProgram-specific solutions are a great way to tackle specific problems, but they can also lead to duplication and lack of coordination. Plus, they might take funding away from other important areas. So, we need to find a balance to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocracy of the time. However, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which diverge from this norm by incorporating elements of mystery and surprise, atypical for the period. These elements enhance the characters within each work, deepening insights into their motivations and emotions. For instance, the protagonist in Oliver Twist experiences vivid dreamlike sequences that reveal his inner self, the struggles he faces, and his awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. When revisiting the event of his shooting in chapter 28, Oliver relives the experience in a dreamlike state, highlighting his lack of control over the events and the dire straits his health has been in. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit emphasize his despair, and the shooting itself numbs all his senses, leaving him feeling overwhelmed and defeated. This event raises questions about whose will is manipulating his misfortune, as it's clear it's not his own. The shooting also underscores Oliver's lack of control over life events, reinforcing the notion that he doesn't even attempt to assert control when his life is in danger. This suggests a growing sense of defeat, as if his mentor, Fagin, has begun to break him, compelling him to accept this despair and severely impacting his ability to react.",
            "A couple of years ago, I was tutoring in an after-school program for elementary-age students. My forte was English and reading, but I was recruited by a teacher to help a boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. He was in third or fourth grade, and something seemed off. He could pronounce certain letters perfectly, but others, not at all. I realized he could read but didn't know the English alphabet well. His mother spoke only Spanish, and with my limited Spanish, we communicated, but I understood then: Adrian needed tutoring in English reading, specifically on the alphabet and pronunciation. I'm not sure if this helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier in schools, especially in California. It's not always as apparent as we think. Even a child speaking perfect English may struggle with reading. Everyone agrees this problem exists, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was simple: English reading tutoring. But for children barely speaking English, it's more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none alone will solve this. The key is combining all these approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is excellent. It benefits children whose first language is Spanish but also those learning English. Research shows children in bilingual programs outperform their peers. People fear it's a resource waste, but that's false. If implemented widely, all children would benefit. But how do we do it? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's unreasonable. Instead, we could employ bilingual aids or tutors.",
            "From the time we are children, many of us are told that there is something out there that is larger than ourselves, something we can't fully understand. Some of us learn about it in Sunday school, others in temples, or within ourselves. We often accept the religions passed down by our parents, but some of us reject them completely, believing that there's nothing beyond our own personal egocentric universe. We may embrace one belief system only to later change our minds and adopt another. Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives. We search for a guiding light to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was. We were sitting on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain beat down on the tin roof as we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters were overflowing, drenching the plants along the edge of the porch. He stared out into the rain, a look that seemed both searching and reminiscing. He had grown gaunt over the past few months, his clothes hanging loosely on his frame, and his hair thinner and sparser than I remembered. He continued to gaze out into the rain, avoiding my eyes. I felt alone, scared, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because admitting it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in looking out into the June twilight rain.\n\nMy father passed away in December of that year, just five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering but extended his life a few more months beyond what the doctors had predicted. I couldn't understand the value of this when it just meant more suffering. I thought to myself, \"What kind of God would do this?\" Alone in the night, I refused to pray. If God existed, I believed he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI didn't want to watch him leave this life to enter another. So I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that created me as it ended. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than anyone, better than his own family, and I was sure he wouldn't want his only child to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "So another month has passed, and of course, seeing as how my life is pretty much stagnant, nothing much happened. Well, except for the stuff I'm gonna talk about now. I finally completed the beta version of the tradenet website. Of course, this was after much dragging of both feet (well, waddaya expect?). Kept adding and improving it. Probably gonna register a domain and get the site up and running by the middle of January 04. The delay being attributed to a lack of funds, and a means of which to transfer it to the web hosting company. My partner is gonna get his credit card in January, so that's when we're gonna set up the site. And how could I forget the other main thing that happened. I flunked accounting. Oh my god. I flunked. I guess I could see it coming, from the moment I got out of the exam hall after the paper, I pretty much knew. I just flunked with 47 outta 100. I dunno. Is it worse flunking knowing that you are so close to passing or worse is you flunked badly? I'm guessing the former. Well, just cos it's borderline, I put in an appeal to the course coordinator. Not hoping for much but at least there is hope. On the bright side, I did get distinctions for law and economics. I suppose that if you like a course, you're more motivated to do well in it. But then, you'd like a course if you find it easy to understand. Hmm, a catch 22 situation. Well, Gonna get the appeal result this week. Crossing my fingers there. Other than those things of note, nothing much has happened. Guess that's it for now. Till next time.\n\nWell, I have this affliction called shyness. Every time I talk to strangers, especially to one of the opposite sex, I turn into jello. I can't think, I start to tremble and I basically just freeze up. It doesn't happen all the time nowadays but it happened today at the YEN meeting. I had to tell Genevieve that I hadn't received the invitation to the club mailing list yet. I thought I could do it without any trouble but I was obviously wrong. I suppose that I care too much about what others think of me and my personality and brain just shuts down. She was trying to be nice but I didn't react to her being nice to me very well at all. I hope I didn't look too much like a dweeb. But I'm working on this problem. That's one of the main reasons that I joined YEN in the first place. That is, to force myself into situations where I would have no choice but to interact with strangers, especially those from the opposite gender. I mean, if I want to get anywhere in life, I can't do it on my own. It's not to bad with people whom I know well, but there is still that niggling fear inside of me. That's why I've never had the nerve to get into any relationship. You have no idea how frustrating it is to want something so bad but are too god damned afraid to just reach out and get it. No matter what happens, I WILL overcome this disability, if you will. And the only way to do that is through increased interaction. The other problem I have is that of positive thinking which directly affects my motivation. I don't want to say it as it's too overused but it's the truth. It's all my parents' fault. Especially my mom. She's just so negative ALL the time. It might seem unfilial (I'm not known for that) to say this but it's all to do with her society and upbringing. They aren't generally known for their achievements. Now she's passed it on to me. The only positive thing is that now that I'm aware of this shortcoming, I can work towards eliminating it. I have to be smart about it. Talked to the yen guy I met through Darren. Damn. I can't recall his name. He's a total 'Adam Knoo' convert. It might be unwise to turn evangelical for anything but in this case it's a positive thing. He should know that fanatic behavior has a knack of turning people off. But the thing is that he made me realize how negative in my thoughts I've been lately. How small I've been thinking. So negative I am disgusted with myself. I will stop using the word 'tyr' and use the word 'MUST'. It's amazing how much difference a word and thought makes in your life. So I MUST come up with a study and work schedule on Sunday and I MUST follow through with that schedule. There! That's settled then. I paradigm shift in actions and thought.\n\nWell, Kings has gone and gotten himself a girlfriend. Well, smack me silly and turn me inside out. Wouldn't have thought that would happen anytime soon. Goes to show how life can sometimes blindside you when you least expect it. So there it is. My kemosabe in bachelorhood arms has deserted me. Can't say I blame him though. Except the reason for him to get together with this girl are rather suspect. I'll never be sure whether he got together with her just to prove to himself that he could get a girlfriend or that he is really sincerely into this girl. Only way to find out is to just ask him directly but that would just make our friendship take a weird turn. Oh well.\n\nDamn! Been a long while since I added any new entries (not that anyone would care of course) But hot damn! Lazy bones strikes again. Sometimes I wonder why I bothered to have a blog in the first place. Well, it's the school holidays now. Finished the exams. I hope to pass all four papers but we all hope for good things don't we. Anyway, the accounts paper was a bust. Same feeling as the stats paper last semester. Probably gonna flunk accounts. But there's always a chance I'll pass eh. Heck, same thing happened to stats last sm and I passed that one. So tomorrow, or I should say today, I'm gonna go down to the registry of companies and I'm gonna register a business partnership with Kumar. It's been a long time coming I can tell you that much. Gonna call the new company 'Epac Trading Company' in honor of the earlier supposed but on hold partnership with the other two future partners for Entrepac. Well, see what happens tomorrow then. Oh and I'm working on tradenet now. Damn I loathe programming. But I gave my word that I'll do it and I don't like to break it. Though sometimes there are extenuating circumstances. Heck, there's always an excuse to not do something eh.\n\nI just read this URL article, specifically the section referring to the remarks made by URL Bill Cosby. In it, he talks about the culture of victimism in America. This got me to think about the culture of victimism in the civilized world as we know it today. I get tired when I hear people blaming everything but themselves for their less than desired life situations. Or saying that it's meant to be. In my humble opinion, unless you are mentally incapacitated, you and only yourself are responsible for the life that you lead. There is no two ways about it. What is the point of blaming everything for your troubles? Why not get off your ass and do something about it? I'd like to think that I am doing so through actively taking actions that have a specific life goal in mind. You can't go anywhere if you don't have anywhere that you want to go to. So I suppose the key is to decide upon a goal that you want to strive towards. But it's not just goal setting that's important. It must be with a sense of discipline that you work towards your goal with. Though that by no means guarantees success, success cannot be achieved otherwise.\n\nSlept at 10 last night. That's something I haven't done in such a long time. I actually can't remember the last time I went to bed before midnight. There's just so many better things to do than sleep. Guess it finally caught up with me. Woke up at half past 11 the next morning. A good 13 1/2 hours of sleep. Funnily enough it wasn't as refreshing as I would have thought it would have been. I could actually stay awake throughout the lecture today. Can't say the same thing about paying attention though. That's what getting enough Zs can do for you. I must study Econ tomorrow. Yes. Must. That's the power of suggestion. Saying and thinking it are two totally different things when you turn them into action. Saying that you MUST instead of saying that you will TRY. Now I know. So I MUST complete the first three topics tomorrow. Not that I've got any better things to do. Yes, I know it's ambitious considering my procrastinative past. But I MUST do it. After all, I am answering it MYSELF. And lying to yourself is far worse than lying to anyone else, wouldn't you agree?\n\nIt's a week and a half till the next semester begins. Man, the holidays flew past in a blink of an eye, didn't they. This is probably the last holiday that I will have to just laze around and do pretty much nothing. The next holiday, at the end of this year, I'll probably be busy with the DPP project (one big mother of a research project) and with the starting up of the tuition center. The following holiday, during mid-2005, I'll be in Melbourne at RMIT, for most of that month. So that doesn't leave much time for breathers in between. Phew! From here on out, it'll be one mad rush. And that's just the beginning of life then. I look towards it with mixed feelings really. On one hand, it'll be great to be able to start earning my keep. But on the other hand, I don't want to leave the security of school so soon. But time marches on. And there is nothing anyone can do about it. All I can do is to face it head on and hope that life doesn't chew me up and spit me out. But that's just being pessimistic. Remember the glass is half full!\n\nWell, I was just in one of my rhetoric moods just now. I was thinking of how sad it was that good friends can grow apart as you grow up. You gain new perspectives as you grow and those might not be the same as your friends. Like you're in different realities. Sometimes you grow apart because of differing views and sometimes it's because of circumstances. Some of which are not under your control but most of which are. Things like gaining a new ideological belief, new social groups, or just something as simple as getting a new job. Any of which can cause you to not make contact as often as you would like. I used to believe that it was their fault for not keeping in touch. But then I realized that I was as much at fault as anyone else in my life. People walk in and walk out of your life. You can try to keep them from walking out but ultimately, it's their choice. Guess that's why you have to choose your friends carefully. But then again, if you are too guarded in your choices, you might be artificially restricting yourself. Ah the choices we all make. I've had many good people in my life. It's sad to reminisce on the good times past as you know the chances of regaining those times are slim to none. So there's no use dwelling on them. But you don't want to discount their value in helping to shape you into the person that you are today. And yet, you don't want to let them hold you back from becoming the person that you're going to be tomorrow. Sigh. This doesn't happen much when you're a teenager but it starts when you reach adulthood. You wish to be as carefree as you were then. Letting your parents worry for you. Reality was just for other people. You lived in a cocoon, in your own world. Ah the good old days.",
            "Alright, so supply chain management is all about moving goods from when you first get an order from a customer right down to when the product eventually reaches them. This term was coined in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. He described it as the process of planning, implementing, and controlling all the activities involved in the supply chain to ensure customer satisfaction in a quick and efficient manner. There are six main components to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these six elements to deliver the best possible service to their customers.\n\nStarting with production, which is the first and most crucial step in the supply chain. Production lays the groundwork for the entire process. Managers need to know what their customers want, so they look at the market to determine customer demand. Once they understand what customers need, they can decide what products to produce and how many of each to make. After that, they choose where to produce these products, considering factors like volume and quality, and always keeping customer satisfaction in mind.\n\nOnce the production location is set, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Production is a critical step, and every detail must be planned meticulously. For instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, and both companies have designed processes for every aspect of their operations. Having these outlined processes ensures smooth operation without confusion or misunderstandings about expectations and directions.\n\nThe next key element is supply. Supply involves making strategic decisions about the core capabilities of a facility and forming outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must choose the best division for each product process. They may also decide to outsource work to other companies to increase velocity. Velocity means providing quality and flexibility while keeping costs low or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "Every month that goes by, and I'm left here, barely moving. Not much happens, except for the tales I'm about to spin. In Burma, a sign reads that Hitler is alive. Ellen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner, a cardboard message held high above her head, handwritten in Sharpie. Burma, or Myanmar, is a country ruled by a tyrannical military regime since 1962. In 2007, monks led a wave of public protests, known as \"The Saffron Revolution.\" Initially, the government allowed these peaceful gatherings, but soon violence erupted. Monasteries were invaded, and foreign journalists were imprisoned, with one photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, killed on Sept 27, 2007, just for being at a protest. The official death toll is 13, but Colonel Hla Win, a defector, claims thousands were killed.\n\nThis isn't new. Throughout history, governments have crushed dissent to maintain power. Roman emperors declared themselves divine rulers, Japanese emperors are believed to be gods, and our current president, George W. Bush, has a weekly meeting with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a branch of the Republican Party.\n\nTiananmen Square in 1989, where intellectuals and students protested authoritarian rule, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia slaughtered Tutsis and political moderates, are examples of this. Hitler's Third Reich, where Jews were systematically murdered, is another extreme case.\n\nThis is the reality of our world, where power is often wielded without regard for human rights.",
            "Well, Duke Ellington's name is synonymous with jazz for a reason. He had this uncanny ability to keep his orchestra together for decades, which allowed him to fully explore his creative prowess. While his keyboard skills were often understated in his compositions, as a composer, he was a master at crafting intricate pieces that highlighted each band member's unique abilities. Ellington created a framework where soloists could freely improvise, and he also wrote tightly orchestrated phrases that emphasized the specific styles of his musicians to bring out musical ideas. This balance of structure and freedom allowed him to create some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history. The Grove Music dictionary even mentions the Creole Love Call, an early example of Ellington's use of voice as a jazz instrument. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece showcases his ability to complement his soloists and add layers of sound. The piece features a call and response between voice and reeds, with different sections echoing and elaborating on the basic melody. The use of voice and tone color is a stylistic trait that runs throughout Ellington's work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, creating a rich and complementary sound between a muted trumpet and scat singing. Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) showcases his use of muted trombone to great effect, further illustrating his mastery of individual sounds and their combination.",
            "So, I've always felt like I was missing something. It's been this persistent longing that just won't be satisfied. It started when I was 14, right as I was entering my teenage years, and it's still with me now, three years later, at 17. I've shifted my focus from wanting things to wanting someone, but none of the boys I've encountered have caught my interest. They've made their moves, but nothing has sparked my attention. I've spent the past few years questioning this, trying to make sense of it, but I haven't found any concrete answers yet. So, I just keep living my life, wondering about my unfulfilled desire.\n\nUsually, a day at home is peaceful and calm. My parents are great, never arguing with each other, and they hardly argue with me too, aside from when I assert my independence and free-spirited personality, which they don't quite agree with. They're the calm couple, and I'm the energetic one, which makes our family quite dynamic and fun. But today was far from peaceful.\n\nAs I was wandering around the house, trying to find some inspiration, I heard a sudden scream from the kitchen. It was my mom, and she was in pain. I rushed in to find her on the ground, saying \"ow\" in short, painful breaths. I put a hand on her to help her, and she asked me to take her to the hospital. I carried her to the car and drove her there quickly.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the usual medicinal smells and the scent of sickness, but I wasn't focusing on that. My mind was occupied with getting my mom the help she needed. I brought her inside, and the doctors took over. She had fallen off a stepladder while trying to get a vase from the highest shelf in the kitchen.",
            "So, I've got some news for you. This study was all about proving that sticking to a Mediterranean diet (Med diet), especially one that's high in \"alternative Mediterranean\" diet score, can lower your risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, as well as stroke-related death. Now, the alternative Mediterranean diet is basically a tweaked version of the traditional Med diet, focusing on eating more plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, and less animal products and saturated fats. It also allows for moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nNow, previous research has shown that following the Med diet can reduce the risk of dying from cardiovascular issues, and it's more effective than a low-fat diet for weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in overweight people. However, this study is one of the first to look specifically at stroke and stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a group of 121,700 nurses in 11 US states. Every six years from 1984 to 2004, these women filled out food frequency questionnaires, which were used to calculate their 'alternative Mediterranean' diet scores. These scores were based on their nutrient intake over the past year. Around 95% of these nurses stayed in the study for the entire 20 years. Their food intake data was validated, and reports of heart disease, stroke, and death were verified through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Cases where records weren't available were considered \"probable\" and included in the study.\n\nTo account for any individual variations and give a better representation of long-term eating habits, the study used average scores from two years of repeated questionnaires. Adjustments were made for factors that could skew the results, like age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study used a statistical method called Cox proportional-hazard modeling to see how these diet scores were linked to heart disease and stroke risks. The results? Women who stuck closely to the Mediterranean diet had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. Over the 20 years, there were 2,391 new cases of heart disease, 1,763 cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular deaths. Those who scored highest on the alternative Mediterranean diet had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and stroke compared to those who scored the lowest.",
            "Alright, so let's rewind to 2007, and oh boy, did the United States face a real financial powder keg. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market tanked, and some of America's most pivotal corporations were left for dead. This economic downturn is still with us today, so let's delve into how this all went down and how we can prevent it from happening again. Well, the financial crisis was basically a result of arrogant and careless political decision-making that pushed banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans to an underdeveloped financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were pushed to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDS'. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks were left with insufficient capital reserves and passed the chaos onto the repacked mortgages they sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were planted in 1999 during the Clinton administration. The president was aiming for a second term and sought to boost his popularity by easing lending restrictions, which set the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned in 1999, “Fannie Mae has been pressured by the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people, and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its impressive growth in profits.” Holmes accurately predicted the consequences: “But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue like that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As we see in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-fated lending led to the economy's meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors combined to bring the economy to its knees, one being the new and complex mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs were widely used in the lead-up to the crisis, further entangling the economy in the housing market. This led to households and financial markets over-leveraging in the housing market, making them extremely sensitive to price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities in the red. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were quickly sold off cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks under intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie racked up $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, captivating one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose. Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose. In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order. As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes. You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on. You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*) Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and",
            "Watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, which was a live segment, was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The headline was about a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. Her name was not mentioned, but his mug shot showed a man who looked menacing. They gave it a mere two minutes, which I thought was sufficient given it was still unfolding. The only details they provided were that he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I thought they gave it appropriate coverage.\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and no arrests had been made. The SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed short, and I believe that might have been due to a racial bias. I've noticed over the years that minority victims of crime, especially black ones, often get less attention. For instance, if a white child or adult is kidnapped or a victim of a crime, the media goes into overdrive, but minority victims often get bypassed.\nThe next story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about the incident's location, and it was determined to be a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for tips leading to the shooter's arrest.\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They predicted mid to low eighties for the weekend, but the news was short and served as a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\nAnother story was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. A dark-skinned black man, described as about six-foot tall and 150 pounds, was the suspect. He was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They devoted an unusual amount of time emphasizing his race and how dark he was.\nThe final story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, who had been sentenced to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. Instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years, they said \"300\" months. I'm not sure why they used this phrasing; perhaps to make the sentence sound more harsh. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which I didn't think was relevant to the story.",
            "There exists a special bond between brothers; one that's unbreakable and irrevocable, carrying with it a mix of emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. These siblings understand each other more than anyone else could, and seeing their reflection in each other's eyes reveals their true selves. This bond shows its true colors in dire situations, be it for good or ill, and the consequences of these emotions are substantial. By facing these feelings head-on, one can begin to grasp the reality of the bond and the impact it has on their character. “The Scarlet Ibis” explores this theme through the vivid descriptions of a captivating landscape and the interactions between the two brothers involved. The main character, Doodle, and the narrator's perspective present the complex emotions and viewpoints that shape their actions and drive their journey. One emotion stands out above the rest: pride. From their initial outings to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist feels resentment towards his younger brother Doodle. He initially dreams of teaching him various skills, like holding his breath, running, and climbing, but Doodle's weak heart makes these dreams impossible. The protagonist's heart softens, though, when Doodle smiles at him, revealing a deep-seated love within him.",
            "The human brain is a complex, imaginative information-processing machine. As technology evolved from simple to advanced, the analogies used to describe the brain also evolved. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a tome of written words, and most recently, to a computer. As you delve into the intricacies of the brain, remember that these analogies are limited in their usefulness and can lead to misleading conclusions.\n\nInformation processing commences with inputs from the sensory organs, converting physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light particles into electrochemical signals. These sensory inputs are repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when contemplating an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing merges basic information such as color, direction, and border locations to determine the presence of a box. Top-down processing speeds up this recognition by leveraging decisions from earlier stages of bottom-up processing, potentially helping you recognize the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped void in the white background.\n\nOnce information is sufficiently processed, an attention filter evaluates its importance and decides which cognitive processes it should be made accessible to. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you gaze at your shoes, a functional attention filter ensures that you don't notice each one individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name even when spoken amidst noise. There are numerous stages of information processing, with attention modulating the results at each stage.\n\nFor the brain to process information, storage is essential. Multiple types of memory exist, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. Each type of sensory stimulus has its own encoding method. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once information is stored, it must be retained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, active for about 20 seconds, is maintained through an electrical signal looping through specific neurons for a brief period. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be retained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nVarious models propose how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawn from human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented by nodes, and nodes are connected based on their relevance. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which could be linked to “wooden,” and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes aim at the impending threats of both technology and the capitalist system that perpetuates them through the creation of a dystopian society in Brave New World. The citizens are conditioned from birth to prioritize collective happiness over individuality, ensnared in a system that treats them as pawns in a grand game controlled by the World Controller. By examining his work through a Marxist lens, one can uncover Huxley's reservations about the evolution of these systems. Terms like homogeny and reification underscore his critique of the emergent economic order of his time.\n\nCapitalism is skewered through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the common people are blinded from understanding their economic relations to other classes. They are focused solely on personal gain, a result of ideological control, evident in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, are manipulated into a constant state of consumption and indulgence, oblivious to the manipulation. This is an example of hegemony, where the upper classes, though aware, do little to challenge the system. Interactions between social classes are a stark indicator of capitalist oppression.\n\nThe novel portrays a world where genuine human connections are absent. Characters are indistinguishable, even among the main ones, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is hinting that technology and capitalism together strip people of free will and individuality. Emotions like love and deep affection are nonexistent, with interactions kept superficial. For instance, men’s comments about women are often solely about their physical attributes, and women casually discuss their encounters. This societal complacency with their status within the hierarchy reflects Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority so long as they continue to consume and conform.",
            "So here I am, a student at University Park for a couple of years now, or roughly four and a half semesters to be specific. Navigating around campus can be quite a hassle, just as it is for many others. My first year, I was housed in an East Halls dorm room, pretty much the easternmost point of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Getting to classes like those in Willard building, smack dab in the middle of campus, could take up to a quarter of an hour on foot, especially if the weather wasn't cooperating, which is quite often in State College. I chatted with an older alum who told me that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by vast swathes of unused land. Now, that empty space is filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and apartments. As the campus expands, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. So, what's the best solution to this mobility issue? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. But a bike alone won't fix the problem. Students need to use them, and the campus must be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nI was talking to a friend who recently started cycling again after a few years' break. He admitted he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are fantastic,” he said, “they’re the only way to get around.” Cycling is not only good for your health but also the most efficient way to travel. A simple bowl of oatmeal and some physical activity can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus, just as far from campus center as some dorms. The best decision I've made this year was to buy a bike. My daily class at Thomas building is a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. A bike can cut that time down to five minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only drawback is, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas from my house, isn't always the easiest road to ride. Walking is an option too, but I'm just too busy for it. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable way to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day, totaling more than two and a half hours every week. Add that to all the other time I'd need to walk for classes, appointments, and so on, and it's more time than I can spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "So, in my journey towards an education in social work, I've got a clear path in mind. I aim to serve the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on assisting children who've been abused or neglected, and providing support to troubled families. The values I bring to this field are service, respect, a strong ethical nature, a commitment to enhancing relationships between others, and a dedication to growing professionally to stay competent. These values aren't just essential for social workers; they're integral to who I am personally.\n\nI've always desired to help others, but the career path wasn't clear. Through high school and college, I witnessed individuals avoid problems in denial and use less-than-ideal coping mechanisms. Seeing this, I chose a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, unsure of my career path. One summer, a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy fleeing his abusive parents. The next day, he called the police. I drove to his house to check if I could help and talked to the parents about their son's situation. They seemed nervous and blamed their son's \"manipulative\" behavior. This experience made me consider a career in social work to support children in similar family disputes.\n\nAnother crucial value for social work is social justice. Society claims the individual is important, yet we often strive to be like \"everyone else.\" This isn't unique individualism. Throughout school, I protested against social injustice: coloring my hair, dressing to express myself, piercing my ears beyond traditional norms, being open about my involvement with GSBA, and fighting against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will continue to stand against injustice.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the sleep disorder insomnia. The Biological model delves into inherited genetic information and medical aspects of health, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental relationships and their impacts on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review of insomnia examines these models and discusses each piece of research to better explain them. The strengths and weaknesses of the research findings are also critiqued.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized as a Primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while those related to another mental disorder are linked to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other categories include sleep disorders caused by medical complications or substance intake. Dyssomnias like Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS), and Parasomnias such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified, define these disorders. The review focuses primarily on insomnia and the broader topic of primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.",
            "This essay explores Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, from three angles: its definition, diagnosis, and how educators can assist students with CAPD in mainstream classrooms.\n\nCAPD is a condition where the central nervous system struggles to process auditory information effectively. This doesn't mean individuals with CAPD are hearing impaired; rather, their brains have difficulty translating sounds into meaningful information. People with CAPD can hear normally but may struggle to distinguish words from background noise.\n\nCAPD has been studied since the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception.\" Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began testing children with communicative disorders in 1954, and Kimura introduced dichotic testing in 1961. A 1977 conference further spurred research on CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways, such as difficulty in locating sounds, distinguishing between acoustic events, recognizing sound patterns, or differentiating changes in speech. Individuals with CAPD may also struggle to synthesize sound cues and determine the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves observing the patient's listening behavior or performance on auditory function tests, which can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. No single test exists for a conclusive diagnosis, and the cause of CAPD remains unknown. Common tests include presenting multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and asking the patient to identify certain items. Advanced tests may involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses.\n\nTeachers in mainstream classrooms can play a significant role in assisting students with CAPD. They can help by creating a calm, quiet environment, clearly stating instructions, and ensuring the student receives preferential seating. Visual aids and repetition can also be beneficial, as can breaking tasks into smaller, manageable parts.",
            "Another month has come and gone, and not much has changed in my life. But there's one thing I want to talk about. I finally finished the beta version of the tradenet website, after a lot of dragging my feet. It's been a process of adding and improving, and I think I'm going to register a domain and get it online by the middle of January. The delay was due to a lack of funds and a way to transfer it to the web hosting company. My partner will get his credit card in January, so that's when we'll set it up. And of course, I also flunked accounting. I knew I was close to failing, but I didn't think I'd actually flunk. I put in an appeal to the course coordinator, but I don't have high hopes. On the bright side, I got distinctions for law and economics. I guess if you enjoy a course, you're more motivated to do well in it. But then, you enjoy a course when it's easy to understand. Hmm, a catch 22 situation. Anyway, I'll get the appeal result this week. I'm hoping for the best. Otherwise, nothing much happened.\n\nNow, about the other big thing that's been going on. I have this affliction called shyness. When I talk to strangers, especially those of the opposite sex, I turn into jelly. I can't think, I start to tremble, and I just freeze up. It happened today at the YEN meeting. I had to tell Genevieve I hadn't gotten the club mailing list invitation yet. I thought it would be easy, but it wasn't. I care too much about what others think of me, and my brain shuts down. She tried to be nice, but I didn't react well to it. I hope I didn't look like a dweeb. But I'm working on it. One of the main reasons I joined YEN is to force myself into situations where I have to interact with strangers, especially those from the opposite gender. If I want to get anywhere in life, I can't do it on my own. It's not so bad with people I know well, but there's still a fear inside me. That's why I've never had the nerve to get into any relationship. It's frustrating to want something so badly but be too afraid to reach out and get it. No matter what happens, I will overcome this 'disability,' if you will. And the only way to do that is through increased interaction. The other problem I have is positive thinking, which affects my motivation. It's all my parents' fault. Especially my mom. She's so negative all the time. It might seem unfilial to say this, but it's true. She comes from a society and upbringing that isn't generally known for achievements. Now she's passed it on to me. But the positive thing is, now that I'm aware of this shortcoming, I can work towards eliminating it. I Have to be smart about it.\n\nI talked to the YEN guy I met through Darren. I can't remember his name. He's a total 'Adam Knoo' convert. It might be unwise to turn evangelical for anything, but in this case, it's positive. He made me realize how negative my thoughts have been lately. How small I've been thinking. So negative I'm disgusted with myself. I will stop using the word 'try' and use the word 'MUST.' It's amazing how much difference a word and thought makes in your life. So I MUST come up with a study and work schedule on Sunday and I MUST follow through with that schedule. There! That's settled then. A paradigm shift in actions and thought.\n\nWell, Kings has gotten himself a girlfriend. Wouldn't have thought that would happen anytime soon. But life can sometimes blindside you when you least expect it. So there it is. My kemosabe in bachelorhood arms has deserted me. Can't say I blame him though. Except the reason for him to get together with this girl is rather suspect. I'll never be sure whether he got together with her just to prove to himself that he could get a girlfriend or that he's really sincerely into this girl. Only way to find out is to just ask him directly, but that would just make our friendship take a weird turn. Oh well.\n\nSo, onto something else. Been a long while since I added any new entries. But hot damn! Lazy bones strikes again. Sometimes I wonder why I bothered to have a blog in the first place. Well, it's the school holidays now. Finished the exams. I hope to pass all four papers. Anyway, the accounts paper was a bust. Same feeling as the stats paper last semester. Probably gonna flunk accounts. But there's always a chance I'll pass, right? Well, tomorrow, or I should say today, I'm gonna go down to the registry of companies and I'm gonna register a business partnership with Kumar. It's been a long time coming. Gonna call the new company 'Epac Trading Company' in honour of the earlier supposed but on hold partnership with the other two future partners for Entrepac. Well, we'll see what happens tomorrow then. Oh and I'm working on tradenet now. Damn I loathe programming. But I gave my word that I'll do it and I don't like to break it. Though sometimes there are extenuating circumstances. Heck, there's always an excuse not to do something, right?\n\nI just read this article, specifically the section referring to the remarks made by Bill Cosby. In it he talks about the culture of victimism in America. This got me to think about the culture of victimism in the civilised world as we know it today. I get tired when I hear people blaming everything but themselves for their less than desired life situations. Or saying it's meant to be. In my humble opinion, unless you are mentally incapacitated, you, and only you, are responsible for the life you lead. There is no two ways about it. What's the point of blaming everything for your troubles? Why not get off your ass and do something about it? I'd like to think that I am doing so through actively taking actions that have a specific life goal in mind. You can't go anywhere if you don't have anywhere you want to go to. So I suppose the key is that you should decide upon a goal that you want to strive towards. But it's not just goal setting that's important. It must be with a sense of discipline that you work towards your goal with. Though that by no means guarantees success, success cannot be achieved otherwise.\n\nSlept at 10 last night. That's something I haven't done in such a long time. I actually can't remember the last time I went to bed before midnight. There's just so many better things to do than sleep. Guess it finally caught up with me. Woke up at half past 11 the next morning. A good 13 1/2 hours of sleep. Funnily enough, it wasn't as refreshing as I would have thought it would have been. I could actually stay awake throughout the lecture today. Can't say the same thing about paying attention though. That's what getting enough Zs can do for you. I must study econ tomorrow. Yes. Must. That's the power of suggestion. Saying and thinking are two totally different things when you turn them into action. Saying that you MUST instead of saying that you will TRY. Now I know. So I MUST complete the first three topics tomorrow. Not that I've got any better things to do. Yes, I know it's ambitious considering my procrastinative past. But I MUST do it. After all, I am answering it MYSELF. And lying to yourself is far worse than lying to anyone else, wouldn't you agree?\n\nWell, it's a week and a half till the next semester begins. Man, the holidays flew past in a blink of an eye, didn't they? This is probably the last holiday that I will have to just laze around and do pretty much nothing. The next holiday, at the end of this year, I'll probably be busy with the DPP project (one big mother of a research project) and with the starting up of the tuition centre. The following holiday, during mid 2005, I'll be in Melbourne at RMIT, for most of that month. So that doesn't leave much time for breathers in between. Phew! From here on out, it'll be one mad rush. And that's just the beginning of life then. I look toward it with mixed feelings really. On one hand, it'll be great to be able to start earning my keep. But on the other hand, I don't want to leave the security of school so soon. But time marches on. And there is nothing anyone can do about it. All I can do is to face it head on and hope that life doesn't chew me up and spit me out. But that's just being pessimistic. Remember the glass is half full!\n\nWell, I was just in one of my rhetoric moods just now. I was thinking of how sad it was that good friends can grow apart as you grow up. You gain new perspectives as you grow and those might now be the same as your friends. Like you're in different realities. Sometimes you grow apart because of differing views and sometimes it's because of circumstances. Some of which are not under your control but most of which are. Things like gaining new ideological beliefs, new social groups or just something as simple as getting a new job. Any of which can cause you to not make contact as often as you would like. I used to believe that it was their fault for not keeping in touch. But then I realized that I was as much at fault as anyone else in my life. People walk in and walk out of your life. You can try to keep them from walking out but ultimately, it's their choice. Guess that's why you have to choose your friends carefully. But then again, if you are too guarded in your choices, you might be artificially restricting yourself. Ah the choices we all make. I've had many good people in my life. It's sad to reminisce on the good times past as you know the chances of regaining those times are slim to none. So there's no use dwelling on them. But you don't want to discount their value in helping to shape you into the person that you are today. And yet, you don't want to let them hold you back from becoming the person that you're going to be tomorrow. Sigh.\n\nThis doesn't happen much when you're a teenager but it starts when you reach adulthood. You wish to be as carefree as you were then. Letting your parents worry for you. Reality was just for other people. You lived in a cocoon, in your own world. Ah the good old days.",
            "Well, another tale of German colonial rule to ponder upon. We all know how infamous it was for its cruelty, with the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in South West Africa being a stark testament. But let's not oversimplify things. The German colonial empire was as varied as the lands it conquered, with diverse policies and ruling styles. Educational provision followed suit, with significant differences across colonies. Now, when the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a well-educated African population to their surprise. Similarly, German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were met with praise by contemporary authors.\n\nBut you know what was quite different? South West Africa, now Namibia. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a crucial role in schooling natives, the natives' education was mostly left to missionary societies with limited government support. The Europeans, however, got the royal treatment - state schools were established, and missionary schools were heavily supported and regulated. These policies had long-lasting effects on Namibia, even after the Germans were gone. Other German colonies had literate Africans, but in Namibia, the majority remained uneducated and illiterate.\n\nWhy the stark contrast? Social, political, and economic factors played a huge part. This paper wants to delve into these factors, focusing on new research on how settlers and colonial authorities viewed the native Africans.\n\nResearch on colonial education is vast, with many sources in German from the early twentieth century. These works aimed to describe educational systems. Later English studies compared and analyzed these systems, highlighting significant differences. Cohen's work on education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly notable, comparing the two colonies and discussing the factors behind their differences. The large settler population in South West Africa, Cohen argues, explains many differences in its educational system.\n\nNow, let's talk climate. South West Africa had a moderately pleasant climate, with many desert areas. This hospitable environment attracted a significant European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived there, while East Africa, the next largest settler colony, had only 5,336.",
            "So, let's talk about the evolution of popular music over the past century. Popular music has grown into a sprawling landscape with so many genres that it's tough to list them all. But let's zero in on one of the most diverse and expressive genres: Heavy Metal. This genre has been around for about 40 years and has spawned a plethora of sub and sub-sub genres, each with its unique sound. Heavy Metal is known for its wide range of emotions, mainly leaning towards the darker side of the spectrum. It's diverse and flexible, allowing musicians to create their own niches and sub-genres.\n\nToday, the Heavy Metal scene is chock-full of different groups, making it hard to pin down exactly what Heavy Metal is. It's difficult to understand the current metal music landscape without first grasping what the Heavy Metal movement is and why it's more than just a genre.",
            "A few decades before the Surrealists started painting their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, captures not only a woman in awe of her dreamland but also Rousseau’s own personal aspirations as an artist. Since he started his journey, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet faced a tough internal dilemma: whether to conform to or mimic certain painting styles to gain acceptance or to remain creatively independent and unique. The Dream is Rousseau’s magnum opus that best reflects his career-long struggle to choose between these two paths.\n\nTo understand The Dream through this lens, one must first delve into Rousseau’s biography. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed bourgeois prosperity. Unlike his peers, Rousseau didn’t receive formal art training; instead, he worked as a gabelou—a municipal toll service employee—until the age of forty. He was known as douanier, a customs inspector. The death of his first wife, Clémence, followed by the loss of eight infant children left Rousseau with only one daughter, Julia, and deep grief. Painting became his refuge and fresh start.\n\nRousseau’s desire for art world acceptance is understandable given his context. He was uneducated in formal painting and began late in life, working alongside other talented but more famous artists. He longed for recognition like Matisse, but their motivations differed. Matisse feared painting tritely, while Rousseau sought a conventional style to be admitted to the Artiste Français.",
            "Many a great thinker has pondered the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there's a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats asserts in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience. Yet, we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being formally taught in these ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are attempts to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are usually efforts to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than rules for creating or judging good art or moral behavior.\n\nCritiquing art or morals often falls short of capturing their essence. For instance, a discussion about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might revolve around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't explain why it's considered good art. Often, when asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people say, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more complex explanation. Both art and morals can't be fully reduced to their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics shares this transcendental nature. As Wittgenstein suggests, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. /\" It's this \"je ne sais quoi,\" this ineffable quality, that makes both art and morality so powerful and links them together.\n\nI believe morality and art are closely related because we experience them most deeply at a noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They affect us at a level we can experience but not fully explain. This connection is strongest in literature. As McKean states, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Today's Germany stands tall as a united nation, with a unique cultural fusion that stretches from the foothills of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This rich cultural tapestry is felt from Cologne by the Rhine, through the heart of Germany, to the Elbe's banks in the Saxon city of Dresden. Given this unique heritage, it's not surprising that modern Germany is a blend of diverse origins and tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a name shrouded in debate among scholars and historians. While Tacitus believed the name stemmed from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, and others argue it derived from a Gallic word or an Old Irish word, 'garim' meaning 'to shout', the exact origin remains uncertain. For instance, Tacitus wrote in his AD 98 work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", that he considered the Germans to be indigenous and not mixed with other races. He further noted that no one would willingly leave the warmth of Rome for the harsh climate and tough ways of Germania unless it was their home. Indeed, as the Germanic tribes started appearing in the mid-first century, they lived on the empire's borders, trading goods and skills with the Romans. The Romans would occasionally send expeditions to these lands, but they usually returned to their vast empire, leaving the Germanic tribes to live on the frontier.",
            "Downwards, I stared, my mind blankly comprehending the view before me. Silent, unemotionally, my practiced awareness studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding. Thoughts slipped in and out almost faster than they appeared, my consciousness working so smoothly and cleanly that it felt like I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. Once, following advice from an artist I worked with, I bought an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I'd wanted to learn how to draw since I was six, and this book teaches everything from understanding a pencil to processes the brain uses to interpret lines. One technique it teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study, transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture into an easily grasped one. Staring down at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally project that artist’s frame. I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment. Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown. Fingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightening and relaxing as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness. Muscles tightened, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxiously the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again. The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet. Mop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "So, another year is coming to a close, and let me tell you, it's been more than a little bit of a shock. Teenagers are dying behind the wheel, and it's a grim reality that's been building for some time. The National Institutes of Health has been saying it all along: the teen brain just isn't ready for the dangers of driving, and that inexperience is at the root of it all. Not only does this lead to more accidents, but it also increases the risk of rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. And when you add in the fact that teens often drive with their peers—because, let's face it, that's how they roll—well, it's a perfect storm of disaster.\n\nSeveral states have tried to put a stop to this with temporary provisional licenses that limit driving hours and prohibit other teens as passengers. But let me tell you, these are just Band-Aid solutions. The issue is that, as a group, the youngest drivers just aren't equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities. Even seasoned psychologists like Marvin Zuckerman think that 18 is too young to issue a regular driver's license. USA Today reports that he's done research showing that teens under 19-20 are still on a high-risk thrill-seeking streak. It makes sense then to delay driving until that tendency starts to level out. If we keep giving licenses to young teens now, we're setting ourselves up for a whole lot of tragedy in the upcoming years. By 2010, the Baby Boomer's babies will be ready to hit the road, and millions of new teen drivers will be on the streets.\n\nWhat we need is straightforward legislation. Schools could keep teaching driver's education, but no one under 18 could be driving a car. A provisional permit could still be issued, and a set number of practical training hours would be required. California, for instance, currently requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Since this is a problem that affects teens across the country, uniform, national legislation would be a sensible and effective way to protect teens everywhere.\n\nNow, this idea isn't exactly new, but it's time for action. We can't keep looking the other way while our teens are dying behind the wheel. It's time for a change.",
            "So I decided to take a look at the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films. I wanted to check out all of the trick films, which numbered fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films are known for their creative editing techniques used to create illusions. My study mainly involved describing the poetics of most trick films and looking at the unique traits in a few of the later ones. Most of these films were set-bound, using a frontal proscenium, and had no camera movement. Typically, long and medium shots were employed, and each trick film was composed of one shot. However, some films from the early 1900s dared to break these rules by including multiple shots.\n\nOne common feature among these trick films is their filming within an interior set, framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera doesn't move from its proscenium position to follow characters or objects. This style was heavily influenced by theatre and vaudeville and magic acts. One example is Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right and move back and forth horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera doesn't follow them. This composition led to shots being long and medium in nature, borrowing from theatre traditions where the audience views the entire performance within the stage's borders. Actors seldom moved towards the camera, so close-ups weren't used.\n\nTrick films typically follow the rule of one conceptual shot equaling a single film, limiting their length to about a minute or less. This also restricted their dramatic or narrative usage, with most focusing on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts with little story. However, in trick films, a conceptual shot might consist of several physical shots joined together to create illusions of apparition or disappearing, like in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). A careful watch reveals the moment when the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” starts, though the film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor from Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republicanism. Despite being primarily an agriculturalist and having a short career in politics, he was renowned for his commitment and outspoken nature in matters of personal liberty and governance. His dedication to agriculture and his political experiences shaped his strong opinions on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the United States as having a unique chance to establish an ideal system, as there were no native traditions to hinder its creators. He believed in the innate rights of man and their interdependence, arguing that if one right was denied, all would fail, and the remaining rights would be less valuable. These rights, he thought, should be outside the government's reach. He believed that a \"state of nature\" allowed the powerful and cunning to thrive, but in a society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must acknowledge the inherent good and evil within humanity. He was rigid in his belief that morality was dualistic, asserting, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He defined good principles as those that protected private property, promoted agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. A government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its leaders, who would inevitably be driven by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, Taylor believed, was a powerful force but only became evil when it led to sub-societies exploiting others. A good government, he argued, was needed to control man's natural evil and should be closely monitored to prevent the adoption of harmful principles.\n\nLike many Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers than explicitly stated. He recognized that an extensive Federal government could be expensive and potentially oppressive. However, he believed that a strict, literal interpretation could become corrupt without considering the intent of the founders. Furthermore, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Well, another month has gone by, and I have a whole bunch of stuff to talk about that happened. First off, take a look at Figure 17, and you'll see a noticeable drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of our project. That's a bit of a bummer because I'm not sure why that happened. I mean, it’s New England, so the weather could be a factor with people not commuting by bike or on foot due to the cold. Also, it's the end of the fall semester, so everyone's heads are down doing schoolwork or processing grades. And December brings the holiday season, so some folks might have just forgotten about filling out the commuter log. Plus, classes don't resume until late January, and that could also account for the low numbers in February. But none of that explains the February dip. It's possible that projects like this start with a lot of energy and excitement, which naturally wears off over time. To counteract this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March to give the project a boost, and it did help increase log submissions. So, we faced the challenge of keeping the momentum going, especially with the holiday and semester breaks that are common in higher education. Another hurdle is that people just really enjoy driving their cars, which is deeply ingrained in our culture. To get folks interested in alternative commuting, we handed out a ton of gift certificates to all sorts of places like local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. We even considered giving away bicycles or hybrid cars, which could have helped combat that dip in engagement. The prizes we offered were pretty solid at first, but if we had announced bigger prizes like bikes or hybrid cars throughout the project, it might have kept participation higher. For instance, announcing a bike giveaway in December and a hybrid or electric car giveaway in January could have increased engagement instead of it decreasing.",
            "So here's a quick rundown on ETFs. An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that mirrors an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but it's more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. You get the diversification of an index fund and the perks of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, or purchase as few as one share in any transaction. These benefits are quite appealing, but ETFs typically have lower expense ratios than average mutual funds. The downside is you have to pay a commission for any trades involving ETFs, just like with stock orders. Another upside is the wide variety of funds available. But hey, it's always good to check if these stated benefits, like diversification, actually materialize and to what extent. For now, let's look at the ETF IHF and compare it against its top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of all assets in the ETF. Below are these top 10 holdings and their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can normalize the current % of assets to 100% and calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio’s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks, in the proportion they have in the ETF. Here are the calculations:\n\nFrom this chart, it's clear that a portfolio consisting of only the top 10 holdings has a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, which is a 16% increase. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. So, it looks like a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could yield higher returns with a lower Beta. However, these two portfolios might not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios are indeed statistically different, we need to calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's standout poems is \"Dream-Land.\" In this work, he employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced back by Mabbott to Virgil. Virgil utilized the term for an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world. While Virgil did indeed use the term, there's a more contemporary source to which some credit should be given. Poe was particularly captivated by German authors.\n\nThis is notable as it reveals Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" discusses the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe was likely imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was famous for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within Faust's second part lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" In this piece, a king loses his wife after she gives him a goblet. Upon his wife's passing, he becomes a heavy drinker and mourns, eventually deciding it is time for him to die. He bestows his possessions on his children, except for the goblet, which he throws into the ocean before dying. The King of Thule and the description in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, possibly serving as a dark reflection of Poe's own struggles and reliance on drinking as a coping mechanism. Faust was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, only a year before Poe’s use of the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe mentions \"ultma Thule\" once in his collected works, but he uses the term \"Thule\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" bookending the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be considered companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule, a dark and lonely place haunted by dead friends, and sees a world shaded without color. These scenes echo \"The King of Thule\" by Goethe, as the king is in mourning, lonely, and has lost the will to rule or live. The entire poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a significant writer whose work Poe would have known, not only through his admiration for Tennyson but also through the many reproductions of his works after their original publication.",
            "Under California law, could a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by proving the store manager acted with malice? Specifically, the manager was informed twice about the spill but failed to clean it for half an hour because he was having dinner. A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's punitive damage claim outright. To succeed, she must show that the manager's actions were willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm, and that the actions were despicable. Palmer could argue that the manager should have known about the probable harm since multiple customers were injured from slipping before her accident. She might also claim that the manager's failure to address the spill was despicable, considering there were already six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed the manager about the applesauce spill. The manager responded that he was on dinner break and didn't have time to deal with it. Another employee notified the manager about the spill at 5:15 pm, and the manager gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D Markets in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages, and we are considering filing a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. In California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have considered conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of their conduct and deliberately failed to avoid them.",
            "So, four years ago, I enrolled in a CBC course on Islam. The main topic of debate in the class was whether Islam is inherently hostile. I find this question more pertinent now than ever, given the shift in mass media's perception of Islam post-9/11. In 2001, I couldn’t have imagined a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with a Muslim background, becoming a reality in America. It’s fascinating how the media’s view has swung from hostility to extreme tolerance.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography piqued my interest. According to historical accounts, Muhammad’s rise to power and the spread of Islam contradict the image of him portrayed in the biography. I've always heard that Muhammad forced conversions, conquering tribes and imposing Islam upon them. However, the biography presents him as a humble martyr, misunderstood and even humbled. People slowly came to recognize the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nThere are striking parallels between Muhammad's 'miracles' and Jesus' ministry. For instance, Muhammad multiplied a small amount of mutton and milk to feed forty men, a feat reminiscent of Jesus' own miracle. This style of writing makes Muhammad seem like a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles. This downplays the miracle and life of Jesus, making it seem like Muhammad is being used to take credit for Jesus' life and personhood.\n\nMoreover, the biography often presents stories of self-proclaimed converts to Islam, illustrating that they 'found the truth' on their own. However, many of these accounts are third-hand, with the author relaying stories heard from others. I find this method unconvincing because it makes the stories seem less credible and more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most is how the biography elevates Muhammad, depicting him as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man. However, historical records show Muhammad was not as gentle and humble as presented. I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus, as he held them during his lifetime, were swiftly set aside in the evolution of Christian thought following his life. If we observe this historical trajectory in broad terms, we notice a pattern of Christianity straying increasingly from its origins. Today, the world exhibits a growing awareness and unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditionalists persist and resist any thinking beyond what they've been taught, this segment of the population might not have a substantial impact on the whole. Among Christians, historical awareness will significantly increase in future years. There will be a rising desire to differentiate the doctrines that have been added to Christianity over time from Jesus' original intentions. This process may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable: a reversal in the trend of Christian history. A movement will grow in numbers, peeling away layers of doctrine, as if the clock were turning backward, until only the core of Jesus' teachings remain. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing the masses to worship as they did in Jesus' time, adhering solely to his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to guide the way. However, as the theological clock moves backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity within Christendom will reverse into greater uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions, we'll see increasing similarities. Human history is filled with such reversals. For instance, Christians were once persecuted, shunned, and killed by the Roman Empire, but later the empire itself became a Christian institution. Our nation has moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play out in the realm of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source and reducing diversity in the process. What's more, it will become common to read Jesus' words metaphorically, not as literal statements. So, what changed since Jesus' lifetime?\n\nLooking back through history, we find that Judaism was the theological foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, the belief in a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were all central to the religion by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not united. They were divided into factions like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots, with the majority being ordinary people.",
            "Another text that illustrates the inherent greed and self-centeredness of people is \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair. This novel reveals how, at their core, humans are driven to prioritize their own interests and comfort, often neglecting those less fortunate. The owners and directors of the massive factories in the story exemplify this; their sole focus is on expanding their businesses regardless of the consequences. Sinclair uses vivid imagery to depict the detrimental effects of this unchecked power, describing the factories as \"a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" with \"great chimneys\" spewing smoke and \"massive\" piles of animal waste. The workers are also subjected to harsh conditions, with employers prioritizing profits over their employees' well-being. With minimal legal protections and worker representation, the environment is akin to a system of slavery, with workers \"dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "Fitzgerald employs various techniques to evoke certain feelings or attitudes in his readers regarding crucial themes in \"The Great Gatsby.\" Some of these approaches are more potent than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes a mix of adjective-noun pairings and symbolism in his novel to achieve this. He pairs seemingly mismatched adjectives and nouns to create a specific atmosphere around certain subjects. For instance, he often uses color to convey deeper meanings. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald assigns symbolic significance to colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. He builds up these meanings and then later uses them to evoke feelings around key objects.\n\nWhite and gray are significant colors in Fitzgerald's novel. White symbolizes elegance and refinement, while gray represents aging and fading. He reinforces these meanings throughout the story. Daisy and Jordan wear white frequently, as do other characters in various scenes. For example, when Nick attends Gatsby’s party, he observes that people are dressed in white flannels, while Tom is seen in a white shirt when he meets Myrtle. Notably, only when Nick gets impressions of Gatsby’s party do people not wear white, suggesting a shift in importance. Common or unimportant subjects are also described in these colors: Nick travels “down the white chasms of lower New York,” and people at Gatsby’s party have “gray names.” Even mundane characters and settings are described in this way, such as Jordan and Daisy’s “white girlhood,” the “gray cars” and “gray land” in the valley of ashes, and the “gray” Italian child in the railroad.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald establishes the meanings of white/gray, he uses them to underscore unimportance or uniformity. This technique starts with Daisy. After a prolonged period without noticeable use of these colors, Daisy is described as wearing white in a white roadster. This description signals to readers that Daisy is less of a central character and more of a uniform addition to the story, someone Gatsby longs for. Fitzgerald uses similar descriptions of Daisy to reinforce this impression, such as her “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” and her white dress during the encounter between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County is a hot spot for agriculture due to its warm, sunny climate. The region is known for growing tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a thriving market for organic, community-supported agriculture, with many local groups having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also highly sought after in the San Diego area. Many organic farms offer tours and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching, thereby allowing the landowner to enjoy the benefits of government programs while enhancing biodiversity and creating additional income streams. This type of operation not only fills a potentially profitable niche but also promotes a healthier environment by reducing chemical use, which in turn boosts both plant and wildlife diversity.\n\nHowever, organic farming comes with its own set of challenges. It demands more intensive labor for pest control, weed management, and soil fertilization without chemicals. Furthermore, it can be less efficient and more costly than conventional farming, with smaller farms lacking the economies of scale. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, like planting cover crops or managing grazing rotation, can also increase labor costs. For these reasons, a landowner in this scenario might consider seeking financial assistance or expert advice to optimize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land in question is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It's a mix of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan currently identifies over a hundred plant and animal species, including several endangered ones like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as species that may soon be listed as declining.\n\nHistorically, the land was inhabited by Native Americans and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This parcel was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and wood production over many decades. I selected this property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see how a small farmer might reduce costs and maintain wildlife-friendly farming practices. As a model, I looked at an organic farm in the same area.",
            "So another month has gone by, and once again, I find myself reflecting on how culture plays a substantial role in any negotiation. Culture, you see, is not a monolith, but rather a living thing that's as much about what it is not as what it is. It's not singular, uniform, or homogenous. Saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are oversimplifications, though understanding those generalizations can be beneficial. But it's far more practical for a negotiator to focus on how the culture's attitudes and values will impact the negotiations at hand. When encountering a foreign culture, it's natural to compare it to our own, which can present its own set of challenges.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" The preceding quotation is found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and it serves as the opening point for St. Anselm's argument regarding the existence of God. A similar belief is held by another author we will discuss, St. Thomas Aquinas. Since both arguments argue for the existence of the same divine entity, our task is to determine whose argument is more compelling. For the sake of conciseness, we'll assume they're both correct in their belief in the biblical God. To explore their arguments fairly, we must consider a specific concept of God, as their defenses are tailored to that.\n\nStarting with St. Anselm's basic argument, he suggests that understanding God begins with faith and self-reflection. He posits that because God's existence is inherent in our understanding, we cannot imagine Him not existing. While his concept can be somewhat obscure and complicated, the core idea is that God's proof lies within our own minds. We don't need external evidence; instead, we discover the truth about God through introspection. This is often referred to within Christianity as faith.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, however, argues that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without requiring faith. This approach could be advantageous for evangelism, as it would allow for the persuasion of new converts based solely on logic. Aquinas presents five logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates that God's existence is logically necessary.",
            "So, way back in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a man was born who would later come to be known as Buddha. After a life of renouncing the world, he attained enlightenment, and his teachings spread, eventually leading to the formation of Buddhism—the most traditional branch of which is called Theravada Buddhism. This religion is now around twenty-five hundred years old, and it's changed a lot since Buddha's time. For instance, in Sri Lanka, where Theravada Buddhism is practiced, the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Though Buddha never taught about such festivities, monks and laypeople alike participate, highlighting how the religion has evolved. These changes can be seen in everything from surface-level traditions to the very core of the religion's teachings. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time due to both internal and external influences, some hostile and some benign.\n\nThere are some key terms we'll use often in this discussion: internal versus external, and hostile versus benign. Internal forces are those that come from within the Buddhist community, no matter the monastic status. External forces are anything from outside the community. A hostile force is anything that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community, often due to a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force, on the other hand, doesn't mean to harm or help the community—though it might end up doing so.\n\nFirst, let's look at the basics of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially made up of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka sets out the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, like Anatta (no self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Only by understanding these concepts can one escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. This escape also involves the elimination of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), when one becomes enlightened.\n\nIn the Vinaya Pitaka, there are rules for laypeople and monks alike. Laypeople follow the Five Precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). Monks have many more rules to follow. The most fundamental teaching in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, life is suffering (Dukkha). Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico once shared a 57-year rivalry, from 1836 to 1893, with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 being the peak of their rivalry. This period saw many skirmishes before the First World War, with disputes often stemming from differences in religion, culture, and traditions, as well as competing material interests. Many nations with shared borders face similar situations, with David M. Pletcher noting that only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting, overarching American diplomatic problems. These nations are close geographically to the United States and have historically been rivals, while others in Latin America have maintained better relations. Religious differences, like those between the United States and Mexico, have caused rifts throughout history, similar to the ideological struggles during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Diehl and Goerts list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during this period, with most being territorial issues related to border raids and frontier problems. Schmitt explains that the rivalry began to ease as Mexico grew more dependent on the United States, and it ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I had never known existed. Prior to this, I was a nurse, having chosen this profession out of a strong desire for the stability and security I lacked as a child. The phrase, \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick,\" echoed through my adolescence and beyond, guiding me towards nursing. Despite my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist, I found solace in the predictability of my chosen profession.\n\nYet, here I am: 46 years old, single, and unable to work, with no savings and living on Social Security Disability. After 15 years, I have nothing to call my own. Every day is a struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing is certain anymore, but one thing is clear: I could not have survived this long without the help of my family and a few good friends. When disaster strikes, you feel weak, no matter how strong you are.\n\nMy point is that life, both big and small, presents emergencies. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well you prepare, some things are too vast to overcome alone. While I agree that we should reduce our reliance on big government, I believe in the power of community. We should relearn to trust and help each other rather than each of us building our own fallout shelters.\n\nConservatives often praise \"rugged individualism\" as the nation's backbone, but our forefathers' resilience was built on compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. Pioneers crossing the Rockies didn't make it alone; they traveled in wagon trains, supporting each other.\n\nSo, yes, be prepared. I have a disaster kit, including first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and flashlights. But while you're preparing, get to know your neighbors. Trust and community are just as important as personal preparedness.",
            "So, why do organisms evolve as they do? Are there any restrictions or constraints that dictate the direction of evolutionary change? Back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson had this to say: \"Even now, the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" Yet, we find ourselves still grappling with the same question today. Fortunately, mathematical modeling has made strides in understanding various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, both through ontogeny and phylogeny. Our research explores how these mathematical models, combined with experimental studies, can shed light on the mechanisms driving the direction and scale of evolutionary-change in Prunum. We've utilized X-radiographic images of Prunum species to quantify parameters that can be used to model both hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell. We then modeled hypothetical shell morphologies to interpret possible morphological changes in Prunum, merging these results with experimental and descriptive studies to better grasp macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a structure that winds around through 360 degrees of space over time. These turns, or whorls, spiral around an imaginary central axis, the columella, which runs through the shell's central column. The rate at which these whorls enlarge varies, and the continuous line separating each whorl is called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last, with the apex at the top and the base at the bottom. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual orientation is the apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical side and determine where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts, and count from this line, estimating each whorl to a quarter of a full turn.\n\nA shell can also be seen as a series of apertures that traverse time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be tracked via the coordinates of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a formulation is created, parameters can be varied to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Well, I've been watching the stats on neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia for a while now, and it seems like there's barely been any progress over the last decade. While the country's on a good track to meet certain Millennium Development Goals, like water and sanitation, we're falling short on child and maternal health. There are a bunch of reasons why, and it seems like we need to focus more on strengthening the overall health system instead of just tweaking individual programs.\n\nWe've seen a decent improvement in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% meeting the target. But a lot of these are just traditional workers like midwives, who can't handle complicated pregnancies, leading to a lot of maternal deaths from things like hemorrhage. So, these improvements are a bit misleading, and we still have a lot of work to do. Plus, the percentage of children under five getting treatment for diarrhea has gone down, and data on postnatal care is all over the place.\n\nCesarean-section rates are still lower than they should be, around 4%, and there's a big gap between urban and rural rates. This shows that healthcare access is mainly focused on cities. And there's a huge gap in service use between the poorest and richest people, which is likely due to high out-of-pocket costs. So, we need to ask ourselves how to best tackle these issues. Should we focus on specific programs or strengthen the health system as a whole? There are pros and cons to both approaches.\n\nProgram-specific solutions are a great way to tackle specific problems, but they can also lead to duplication and lack of coordination. Plus, they might take funding away from other important areas. So, we need to find a balance to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocracy of the time. However, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which diverge from this norm by incorporating elements of mystery and surprise, atypical for the period. These elements enhance the characters within each work, deepening insights into their motivations and emotions. For instance, the protagonist in Oliver Twist experiences vivid dreamlike sequences that reveal his inner self, the struggles he faces, and his awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. When revisiting the event of his shooting in chapter 28, Oliver relives the experience in a dreamlike state, highlighting his lack of control over the events and the dire straits his health has been in. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit emphasize his despair, and the shooting itself numbs all his senses, leaving him feeling overwhelmed and defeated. This event raises questions about whose will is manipulating his misfortune, as it's clear it's not his own. The shooting also underscores Oliver's lack of control over life events, reinforcing the notion that he doesn't even attempt to assert control when his life is in danger. This suggests a growing sense of defeat, as if his mentor, Fagin, has begun to break him, compelling him to accept this despair and severely impacting his ability to react.",
            "A couple of years ago, I was tutoring in an after-school program for elementary-age students. My forte was English and reading, but I was recruited by a teacher to help a boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. He was in third or fourth grade, and something seemed off. He could pronounce certain letters perfectly, but others, not at all. I realized he could read but didn't know the English alphabet well. His mother spoke only Spanish, and with my limited Spanish, we communicated, but I understood then: Adrian needed tutoring in English reading, specifically on the alphabet and pronunciation. I'm not sure if this helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier in schools, especially in California. It's not always as apparent as we think. Even a child speaking perfect English may struggle with reading. Everyone agrees this problem exists, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was simple: English reading tutoring. But for children barely speaking English, it's more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none alone will solve this. The key is combining all these approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is excellent. It benefits children whose first language is Spanish but also those learning English. Research shows children in bilingual programs outperform their peers. People fear it's a resource waste, but that's false. If implemented widely, all children would benefit. But how do we do it? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's unreasonable. Instead, we could employ bilingual aids or tutors.",
            "From the time we are children, many of us are told that there is something out there that is larger than ourselves, something we can't fully understand. Some of us learn about it in Sunday school, others in temples, or within ourselves. We often accept the religions passed down by our parents, but some of us reject them completely, believing that there's nothing beyond our own personal egocentric universe. We may embrace one belief system only to later change our minds and adopt another. Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives. We search for a guiding light to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was. We were sitting on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain beat down on the tin roof as we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters were overflowing, drenching the plants along the edge of the porch. He stared out into the rain, a look that seemed both searching and reminiscing. He had grown gaunt over the past few months, his clothes hanging loosely on his frame, and his hair thinner and sparser than I remembered. He continued to gaze out into the rain, avoiding my eyes. I felt alone, scared, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because admitting it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in looking out into the June twilight rain.\n\nMy father passed away in December of that year, just five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering but extended his life a few more months beyond what the doctors had predicted. I couldn't understand the value of this when it just meant more suffering. I thought to myself, \"What kind of God would do this?\" Alone in the night, I refused to pray. If God existed, I believed he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI didn't want to watch him leave this life to enter another. So I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that created me as it ended. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than anyone, better than his own family, and I was sure he wouldn't want his only child to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "So another month has passed, and of course, seeing as how my life is pretty much stagnant, nothing much happened. Well, except for the stuff I'm gonna talk about now. I finally completed the beta version of the tradenet website. Of course, this was after much dragging of both feet (well, waddaya expect?). Kept adding and improving it. Probably gonna register a domain and get the site up and running by the middle of January 04. The delay being attributed to a lack of funds, and a means of which to transfer it to the web hosting company. My partner is gonna get his credit card in January, so that's when we're gonna set up the site. And how could I forget the other main thing that happened. I flunked accounting. Oh my god. I flunked. I guess I could see it coming, from the moment I got out of the exam hall after the paper, I pretty much knew. I just flunked with 47 outta 100. I dunno. Is it worse flunking knowing that you are so close to passing or worse is you flunked badly? I'm guessing the former. Well, just cos it's borderline, I put in an appeal to the course coordinator. Not hoping for much but at least there is hope. On the bright side, I did get distinctions for law and economics. I suppose that if you like a course, you're more motivated to do well in it. But then, you'd like a course if you find it easy to understand. Hmm, a catch 22 situation. Well, Gonna get the appeal result this week. Crossing my fingers there. Other than those things of note, nothing much has happened. Guess that's it for now. Till next time.\n\nWell, I have this affliction called shyness. Every time I talk to strangers, especially to one of the opposite sex, I turn into jello. I can't think, I start to tremble and I basically just freeze up. It doesn't happen all the time nowadays but it happened today at the YEN meeting. I had to tell Genevieve that I hadn't received the invitation to the club mailing list yet. I thought I could do it without any trouble but I was obviously wrong. I suppose that I care too much about what others think of me and my personality and brain just shuts down. She was trying to be nice but I didn't react to her being nice to me very well at all. I hope I didn't look too much like a dweeb. But I'm working on this problem. That's one of the main reasons that I joined YEN in the first place. That is, to force myself into situations where I would have no choice but to interact with strangers, especially those from the opposite gender. I mean, if I want to get anywhere in life, I can't do it on my own. It's not to bad with people whom I know well, but there is still that niggling fear inside of me. That's why I've never had the nerve to get into any relationship. You have no idea how frustrating it is to want something so bad but are too god damned afraid to just reach out and get it. No matter what happens, I WILL overcome this disability, if you will. And the only way to do that is through increased interaction. The other problem I have is that of positive thinking which directly affects my motivation. I don't want to say it as it's too overused but it's the truth. It's all my parents' fault. Especially my mom. She's just so negative ALL the time. It might seem unfilial (I'm not known for that) to say this but it's all to do with her society and upbringing. They aren't generally known for their achievements. Now she's passed it on to me. The only positive thing is that now that I'm aware of this shortcoming, I can work towards eliminating it. I have to be smart about it. Talked to the yen guy I met through Darren. Damn. I can't recall his name. He's a total 'Adam Knoo' convert. It might be unwise to turn evangelical for anything but in this case it's a positive thing. He should know that fanatic behavior has a knack of turning people off. But the thing is that he made me realize how negative in my thoughts I've been lately. How small I've been thinking. So negative I am disgusted with myself. I will stop using the word 'tyr' and use the word 'MUST'. It's amazing how much difference a word and thought makes in your life. So I MUST come up with a study and work schedule on Sunday and I MUST follow through with that schedule. There! That's settled then. I paradigm shift in actions and thought.\n\nWell, Kings has gone and gotten himself a girlfriend. Well, smack me silly and turn me inside out. Wouldn't have thought that would happen anytime soon. Goes to show how life can sometimes blindside you when you least expect it. So there it is. My kemosabe in bachelorhood arms has deserted me. Can't say I blame him though. Except the reason for him to get together with this girl are rather suspect. I'll never be sure whether he got together with her just to prove to himself that he could get a girlfriend or that he is really sincerely into this girl. Only way to find out is to just ask him directly but that would just make our friendship take a weird turn. Oh well.\n\nDamn! Been a long while since I added any new entries (not that anyone would care of course) But hot damn! Lazy bones strikes again. Sometimes I wonder why I bothered to have a blog in the first place. Well, it's the school holidays now. Finished the exams. I hope to pass all four papers but we all hope for good things don't we. Anyway, the accounts paper was a bust. Same feeling as the stats paper last semester. Probably gonna flunk accounts. But there's always a chance I'll pass eh. Heck, same thing happened to stats last sm and I passed that one. So tomorrow, or I should say today, I'm gonna go down to the registry of companies and I'm gonna register a business partnership with Kumar. It's been a long time coming I can tell you that much. Gonna call the new company 'Epac Trading Company' in honor of the earlier supposed but on hold partnership with the other two future partners for Entrepac. Well, see what happens tomorrow then. Oh and I'm working on tradenet now. Damn I loathe programming. But I gave my word that I'll do it and I don't like to break it. Though sometimes there are extenuating circumstances. Heck, there's always an excuse to not do something eh.\n\nI just read this URL article, specifically the section referring to the remarks made by URL Bill Cosby. In it, he talks about the culture of victimism in America. This got me to think about the culture of victimism in the civilized world as we know it today. I get tired when I hear people blaming everything but themselves for their less than desired life situations. Or saying that it's meant to be. In my humble opinion, unless you are mentally incapacitated, you and only yourself are responsible for the life that you lead. There is no two ways about it. What is the point of blaming everything for your troubles? Why not get off your ass and do something about it? I'd like to think that I am doing so through actively taking actions that have a specific life goal in mind. You can't go anywhere if you don't have anywhere that you want to go to. So I suppose the key is to decide upon a goal that you want to strive towards. But it's not just goal setting that's important. It must be with a sense of discipline that you work towards your goal with. Though that by no means guarantees success, success cannot be achieved otherwise.\n\nSlept at 10 last night. That's something I haven't done in such a long time. I actually can't remember the last time I went to bed before midnight. There's just so many better things to do than sleep. Guess it finally caught up with me. Woke up at half past 11 the next morning. A good 13 1/2 hours of sleep. Funnily enough it wasn't as refreshing as I would have thought it would have been. I could actually stay awake throughout the lecture today. Can't say the same thing about paying attention though. That's what getting enough Zs can do for you. I must study Econ tomorrow. Yes. Must. That's the power of suggestion. Saying and thinking it are two totally different things when you turn them into action. Saying that you MUST instead of saying that you will TRY. Now I know. So I MUST complete the first three topics tomorrow. Not that I've got any better things to do. Yes, I know it's ambitious considering my procrastinative past. But I MUST do it. After all, I am answering it MYSELF. And lying to yourself is far worse than lying to anyone else, wouldn't you agree?\n\nIt's a week and a half till the next semester begins. Man, the holidays flew past in a blink of an eye, didn't they. This is probably the last holiday that I will have to just laze around and do pretty much nothing. The next holiday, at the end of this year, I'll probably be busy with the DPP project (one big mother of a research project) and with the starting up of the tuition center. The following holiday, during mid-2005, I'll be in Melbourne at RMIT, for most of that month. So that doesn't leave much time for breathers in between. Phew! From here on out, it'll be one mad rush. And that's just the beginning of life then. I look towards it with mixed feelings really. On one hand, it'll be great to be able to start earning my keep. But on the other hand, I don't want to leave the security of school so soon. But time marches on. And there is nothing anyone can do about it. All I can do is to face it head on and hope that life doesn't chew me up and spit me out. But that's just being pessimistic. Remember the glass is half full!\n\nWell, I was just in one of my rhetoric moods just now. I was thinking of how sad it was that good friends can grow apart as you grow up. You gain new perspectives as you grow and those might not be the same as your friends. Like you're in different realities. Sometimes you grow apart because of differing views and sometimes it's because of circumstances. Some of which are not under your control but most of which are. Things like gaining a new ideological belief, new social groups, or just something as simple as getting a new job. Any of which can cause you to not make contact as often as you would like. I used to believe that it was their fault for not keeping in touch. But then I realized that I was as much at fault as anyone else in my life. People walk in and walk out of your life. You can try to keep them from walking out but ultimately, it's their choice. Guess that's why you have to choose your friends carefully. But then again, if you are too guarded in your choices, you might be artificially restricting yourself. Ah the choices we all make. I've had many good people in my life. It's sad to reminisce on the good times past as you know the chances of regaining those times are slim to none. So there's no use dwelling on them. But you don't want to discount their value in helping to shape you into the person that you are today. And yet, you don't want to let them hold you back from becoming the person that you're going to be tomorrow. Sigh. This doesn't happen much when you're a teenager but it starts when you reach adulthood. You wish to be as carefree as you were then. Letting your parents worry for you. Reality was just for other people. You lived in a cocoon, in your own world. Ah the good old days.",
            "Alright, so supply chain management is all about moving goods from when you first get an order from a customer right down to when the product eventually reaches them. This term was coined in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. He described it as the process of planning, implementing, and controlling all the activities involved in the supply chain to ensure customer satisfaction in a quick and efficient manner. There are six main components to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these six elements to deliver the best possible service to their customers.\n\nStarting with production, which is the first and most crucial step in the supply chain. Production lays the groundwork for the entire process. Managers need to know what their customers want, so they look at the market to determine customer demand. Once they understand what customers need, they can decide what products to produce and how many of each to make. After that, they choose where to produce these products, considering factors like volume and quality, and always keeping customer satisfaction in mind.\n\nOnce the production location is set, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Production is a critical step, and every detail must be planned meticulously. For instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, and both companies have designed processes for every aspect of their operations. Having these outlined processes ensures smooth operation without confusion or misunderstandings about expectations and directions.\n\nThe next key element is supply. Supply involves making strategic decisions about the core capabilities of a facility and forming outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must choose the best division for each product process. They may also decide to outsource work to other companies to increase velocity. Velocity means providing quality and flexibility while keeping costs low or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "Every month that goes by, and I'm left here, barely moving. Not much happens, except for the tales I'm about to spin. In Burma, a sign reads that Hitler is alive. Ellen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner, a cardboard message held high above her head, handwritten in Sharpie. Burma, or Myanmar, is a country ruled by a tyrannical military regime since 1962. In 2007, monks led a wave of public protests, known as \"The Saffron Revolution.\" Initially, the government allowed these peaceful gatherings, but soon violence erupted. Monasteries were invaded, and foreign journalists were imprisoned, with one photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, killed on Sept 27, 2007, just for being at a protest. The official death toll is 13, but Colonel Hla Win, a defector, claims thousands were killed.\n\nThis isn't new. Throughout history, governments have crushed dissent to maintain power. Roman emperors declared themselves divine rulers, Japanese emperors are believed to be gods, and our current president, George W. Bush, has a weekly meeting with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a branch of the Republican Party.\n\nTiananmen Square in 1989, where intellectuals and students protested authoritarian rule, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia slaughtered Tutsis and political moderates, are examples of this. Hitler's Third Reich, where Jews were systematically murdered, is another extreme case.\n\nThis is the reality of our world, where power is often wielded without regard for human rights.",
            "Well, Duke Ellington's name is synonymous with jazz for a reason. He had this uncanny ability to keep his orchestra together for decades, which allowed him to fully explore his creative prowess. While his keyboard skills were often understated in his compositions, as a composer, he was a master at crafting intricate pieces that highlighted each band member's unique abilities. Ellington created a framework where soloists could freely improvise, and he also wrote tightly orchestrated phrases that emphasized the specific styles of his musicians to bring out musical ideas. This balance of structure and freedom allowed him to create some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history. The Grove Music dictionary even mentions the Creole Love Call, an early example of Ellington's use of voice as a jazz instrument. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece showcases his ability to complement his soloists and add layers of sound. The piece features a call and response between voice and reeds, with different sections echoing and elaborating on the basic melody. The use of voice and tone color is a stylistic trait that runs throughout Ellington's work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, creating a rich and complementary sound between a muted trumpet and scat singing. Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) showcases his use of muted trombone to great effect, further illustrating his mastery of individual sounds and their combination.",
            "So, I've always felt like I was missing something. It's been this persistent longing that just won't be satisfied. It started when I was 14, right as I was entering my teenage years, and it's still with me now, three years later, at 17. I've shifted my focus from wanting things to wanting someone, but none of the boys I've encountered have caught my interest. They've made their moves, but nothing has sparked my attention. I've spent the past few years questioning this, trying to make sense of it, but I haven't found any concrete answers yet. So, I just keep living my life, wondering about my unfulfilled desire.\n\nUsually, a day at home is peaceful and calm. My parents are great, never arguing with each other, and they hardly argue with me too, aside from when I assert my independence and free-spirited personality, which they don't quite agree with. They're the calm couple, and I'm the energetic one, which makes our family quite dynamic and fun. But today was far from peaceful.\n\nAs I was wandering around the house, trying to find some inspiration, I heard a sudden scream from the kitchen. It was my mom, and she was in pain. I rushed in to find her on the ground, saying \"ow\" in short, painful breaths. I put a hand on her to help her, and she asked me to take her to the hospital. I carried her to the car and drove her there quickly.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the usual medicinal smells and the scent of sickness, but I wasn't focusing on that. My mind was occupied with getting my mom the help she needed. I brought her inside, and the doctors took over. She had fallen off a stepladder while trying to get a vase from the highest shelf in the kitchen.",
            "So, I've got some news for you. This study was all about proving that sticking to a Mediterranean diet (Med diet), especially one that's high in \"alternative Mediterranean\" diet score, can lower your risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, as well as stroke-related death. Now, the alternative Mediterranean diet is basically a tweaked version of the traditional Med diet, focusing on eating more plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, and less animal products and saturated fats. It also allows for moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nNow, previous research has shown that following the Med diet can reduce the risk of dying from cardiovascular issues, and it's more effective than a low-fat diet for weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in overweight people. However, this study is one of the first to look specifically at stroke and stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a group of 121,700 nurses in 11 US states. Every six years from 1984 to 2004, these women filled out food frequency questionnaires, which were used to calculate their 'alternative Mediterranean' diet scores. These scores were based on their nutrient intake over the past year. Around 95% of these nurses stayed in the study for the entire 20 years. Their food intake data was validated, and reports of heart disease, stroke, and death were verified through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Cases where records weren't available were considered \"probable\" and included in the study.\n\nTo account for any individual variations and give a better representation of long-term eating habits, the study used average scores from two years of repeated questionnaires. Adjustments were made for factors that could skew the results, like age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study used a statistical method called Cox proportional-hazard modeling to see how these diet scores were linked to heart disease and stroke risks. The results? Women who stuck closely to the Mediterranean diet had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. Over the 20 years, there were 2,391 new cases of heart disease, 1,763 cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular deaths. Those who scored highest on the alternative Mediterranean diet had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and stroke compared to those who scored the lowest.",
            "Alright, so let's rewind to 2007, and oh boy, did the United States face a real financial powder keg. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market tanked, and some of America's most pivotal corporations were left for dead. This economic downturn is still with us today, so let's delve into how this all went down and how we can prevent it from happening again. Well, the financial crisis was basically a result of arrogant and careless political decision-making that pushed banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans to an underdeveloped financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were pushed to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDS'. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks were left with insufficient capital reserves and passed the chaos onto the repacked mortgages they sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were planted in 1999 during the Clinton administration. The president was aiming for a second term and sought to boost his popularity by easing lending restrictions, which set the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned in 1999, “Fannie Mae has been pressured by the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people, and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its impressive growth in profits.” Holmes accurately predicted the consequences: “But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue like that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As we see in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-fated lending led to the economy's meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors combined to bring the economy to its knees, one being the new and complex mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs were widely used in the lead-up to the crisis, further entangling the economy in the housing market. This led to households and financial markets over-leveraging in the housing market, making them extremely sensitive to price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities in the red. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were quickly sold off cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks under intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie racked up $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, captivating one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose. Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name. Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much. Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose. In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order. As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes. You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on. You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*) Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and",
            "Watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, which was a live segment, was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The headline was about a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. Her name was not mentioned, but his mug shot showed a man who looked menacing. They gave it a mere two minutes, which I thought was sufficient given it was still unfolding. The only details they provided were that he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I thought they gave it appropriate coverage.\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and no arrests had been made. The SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed short, and I believe that might have been due to a racial bias. I've noticed over the years that minority victims of crime, especially black ones, often get less attention. For instance, if a white child or adult is kidnapped or a victim of a crime, the media goes into overdrive, but minority victims often get bypassed.\nThe next story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about the incident's location, and it was determined to be a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for tips leading to the shooter's arrest.\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They predicted mid to low eighties for the weekend, but the news was short and served as a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\nAnother story was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. A dark-skinned black man, described as about six-foot tall and 150 pounds, was the suspect. He was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They devoted an unusual amount of time emphasizing his race and how dark he was.\nThe final story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, who had been sentenced to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. Instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years, they said \"300\" months. I'm not sure why they used this phrasing; perhaps to make the sentence sound more harsh. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which I didn't think was relevant to the story.",
            "There exists a special bond between brothers; one that's unbreakable and irrevocable, carrying with it a mix of emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. These siblings understand each other more than anyone else could, and seeing their reflection in each other's eyes reveals their true selves. This bond shows its true colors in dire situations, be it for good or ill, and the consequences of these emotions are substantial. By facing these feelings head-on, one can begin to grasp the reality of the bond and the impact it has on their character. “The Scarlet Ibis” explores this theme through the vivid descriptions of a captivating landscape and the interactions between the two brothers involved. The main character, Doodle, and the narrator's perspective present the complex emotions and viewpoints that shape their actions and drive their journey. One emotion stands out above the rest: pride. From their initial outings to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist feels resentment towards his younger brother Doodle. He initially dreams of teaching him various skills, like holding his breath, running, and climbing, but Doodle's weak heart makes these dreams impossible. The protagonist's heart softens, though, when Doodle smiles at him, revealing a deep-seated love within him.",
            "The human brain is a complex, imaginative information-processing machine. As technology evolved from simple to advanced, the analogies used to describe the brain also evolved. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a tome of written words, and most recently, to a computer. As you delve into the intricacies of the brain, remember that these analogies are limited in their usefulness and can lead to misleading conclusions.\n\nInformation processing commences with inputs from the sensory organs, converting physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light particles into electrochemical signals. These sensory inputs are repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when contemplating an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing merges basic information such as color, direction, and border locations to determine the presence of a box. Top-down processing speeds up this recognition by leveraging decisions from earlier stages of bottom-up processing, potentially helping you recognize the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped void in the white background.\n\nOnce information is sufficiently processed, an attention filter evaluates its importance and decides which cognitive processes it should be made accessible to. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you gaze at your shoes, a functional attention filter ensures that you don't notice each one individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name even when spoken amidst noise. There are numerous stages of information processing, with attention modulating the results at each stage.\n\nFor the brain to process information, storage is essential. Multiple types of memory exist, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. Each type of sensory stimulus has its own encoding method. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once information is stored, it must be retained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, active for about 20 seconds, is maintained through an electrical signal looping through specific neurons for a brief period. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be retained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nVarious models propose how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawn from human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented by nodes, and nodes are connected based on their relevance. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which could be linked to “wooden,” and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes aim at the impending threats of both technology and the capitalist system that perpetuates them through the creation of a dystopian society in Brave New World. The citizens are conditioned from birth to prioritize collective happiness over individuality, ensnared in a system that treats them as pawns in a grand game controlled by the World Controller. By examining his work through a Marxist lens, one can uncover Huxley's reservations about the evolution of these systems. Terms like homogeny and reification underscore his critique of the emergent economic order of his time.\n\nCapitalism is skewered through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the common people are blinded from understanding their economic relations to other classes. They are focused solely on personal gain, a result of ideological control, evident in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, are manipulated into a constant state of consumption and indulgence, oblivious to the manipulation. This is an example of hegemony, where the upper classes, though aware, do little to challenge the system. Interactions between social classes are a stark indicator of capitalist oppression.\n\nThe novel portrays a world where genuine human connections are absent. Characters are indistinguishable, even among the main ones, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is hinting that technology and capitalism together strip people of free will and individuality. Emotions like love and deep affection are nonexistent, with interactions kept superficial. For instance, men’s comments about women are often solely about their physical attributes, and women casually discuss their encounters. This societal complacency with their status within the hierarchy reflects Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority so long as they continue to consume and conform.",
            "So here I am, a student at University Park for a couple of years now, or roughly four and a half semesters to be specific. Navigating around campus can be quite a hassle, just as it is for many others. My first year, I was housed in an East Halls dorm room, pretty much the easternmost point of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Getting to classes like those in Willard building, smack dab in the middle of campus, could take up to a quarter of an hour on foot, especially if the weather wasn't cooperating, which is quite often in State College. I chatted with an older alum who told me that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by vast swathes of unused land. Now, that empty space is filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and apartments. As the campus expands, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. So, what's the best solution to this mobility issue? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. But a bike alone won't fix the problem. Students need to use them, and the campus must be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nI was talking to a friend who recently started cycling again after a few years' break. He admitted he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are fantastic,” he said, “they’re the only way to get around.” Cycling is not only good for your health but also the most efficient way to travel. A simple bowl of oatmeal and some physical activity can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus, just as far from campus center as some dorms. The best decision I've made this year was to buy a bike. My daily class at Thomas building is a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. A bike can cut that time down to five minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only drawback is, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas from my house, isn't always the easiest road to ride. Walking is an option too, but I'm just too busy for it. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable way to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day, totaling more than two and a half hours every week. Add that to all the other time I'd need to walk for classes, appointments, and so on, and it's more time than I can spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "So, in my journey towards an education in social work, I've got a clear path in mind. I aim to serve the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on assisting children who've been abused or neglected, and providing support to troubled families. The values I bring to this field are service, respect, a strong ethical nature, a commitment to enhancing relationships between others, and a dedication to growing professionally to stay competent. These values aren't just essential for social workers; they're integral to who I am personally.\n\nI've always desired to help others, but the career path wasn't clear. Through high school and college, I witnessed individuals avoid problems in denial and use less-than-ideal coping mechanisms. Seeing this, I chose a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break, unsure of my career path. One summer, a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy fleeing his abusive parents. The next day, he called the police. I drove to his house to check if I could help and talked to the parents about their son's situation. They seemed nervous and blamed their son's \"manipulative\" behavior. This experience made me consider a career in social work to support children in similar family disputes.\n\nAnother crucial value for social work is social justice. Society claims the individual is important, yet we often strive to be like \"everyone else.\" This isn't unique individualism. Throughout school, I protested against social injustice: coloring my hair, dressing to express myself, piercing my ears beyond traditional norms, being open about my involvement with GSBA, and fighting against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will continue to stand against injustice.",
            "This paper explores the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the sleep disorder insomnia. The Biological model delves into inherited genetic information and medical aspects of health, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental relationships and their impacts on race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The review of insomnia examines these models and discusses each piece of research to better explain them. The strengths and weaknesses of the research findings are also critiqued.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized as a Primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. Primary sleep disorders are Dyssomnias or Parasomnias, while those related to another mental disorder are linked to Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other categories include sleep disorders caused by medical complications or substance intake. Dyssomnias like Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS), and Parasomnias such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified, define these disorders. The review focuses primarily on insomnia and the broader topic of primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.",
            "This essay explores Central Auditory Processing Disorder, or CAPD, from three angles: its definition, diagnosis, and how educators can assist students with CAPD in mainstream classrooms.\n\nCAPD is a condition where the central nervous system struggles to process auditory information effectively. This doesn't mean individuals with CAPD are hearing impaired; rather, their brains have difficulty translating sounds into meaningful information. People with CAPD can hear normally but may struggle to distinguish words from background noise.\n\nCAPD has been studied since the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception.\" Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began testing children with communicative disorders in 1954, and Kimura introduced dichotic testing in 1961. A 1977 conference further spurred research on CAPD.\n\nCAPD can manifest in various ways, such as difficulty in locating sounds, distinguishing between acoustic events, recognizing sound patterns, or differentiating changes in speech. Individuals with CAPD may also struggle to synthesize sound cues and determine the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves observing the patient's listening behavior or performance on auditory function tests, which can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others. No single test exists for a conclusive diagnosis, and the cause of CAPD remains unknown. Common tests include presenting multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and asking the patient to identify certain items. Advanced tests may involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses.\n\nTeachers in mainstream classrooms can play a significant role in assisting students with CAPD. They can help by creating a calm, quiet environment, clearly stating instructions, and ensuring the student receives preferential seating. Visual aids and repetition can also be beneficial, as can breaking tasks into smaller, manageable parts.",
            "Another month has come and gone, and not much has changed in my life. But there's one thing I want to talk about. I finally finished the beta version of the tradenet website, after a lot of dragging my feet. It's been a process of adding and improving, and I think I'm going to register a domain and get it online by the middle of January. The delay was due to a lack of funds and a way to transfer it to the web hosting company. My partner will get his credit card in January, so that's when we'll set it up. And of course, I also flunked accounting. I knew I was close to failing, but I didn't think I'd actually flunk. I put in an appeal to the course coordinator, but I don't have high hopes. On the bright side, I got distinctions for law and economics. I guess if you enjoy a course, you're more motivated to do well in it. But then, you enjoy a course when it's easy to understand. Hmm, a catch 22 situation. Anyway, I'll get the appeal result this week. I'm hoping for the best. Otherwise, nothing much happened.\n\nNow, about the other big thing that's been going on. I have this affliction called shyness. When I talk to strangers, especially those of the opposite sex, I turn into jelly. I can't think, I start to tremble, and I just freeze up. It happened today at the YEN meeting. I had to tell Genevieve I hadn't gotten the club mailing list invitation yet. I thought it would be easy, but it wasn't. I care too much about what others think of me, and my brain shuts down. She tried to be nice, but I didn't react well to it. I hope I didn't look like a dweeb. But I'm working on it. One of the main reasons I joined YEN is to force myself into situations where I have to interact with strangers, especially those from the opposite gender. If I want to get anywhere in life, I can't do it on my own. It's not so bad with people I know well, but there's still a fear inside me. That's why I've never had the nerve to get into any relationship. It's frustrating to want something so badly but be too afraid to reach out and get it. No matter what happens, I will overcome this 'disability,' if you will. And the only way to do that is through increased interaction. The other problem I have is positive thinking, which affects my motivation. It's all my parents' fault. Especially my mom. She's so negative all the time. It might seem unfilial to say this, but it's true. She comes from a society and upbringing that isn't generally known for achievements. Now she's passed it on to me. But the positive thing is, now that I'm aware of this shortcoming, I can work towards eliminating it. I Have to be smart about it.\n\nI talked to the YEN guy I met through Darren. I can't remember his name. He's a total 'Adam Knoo' convert. It might be unwise to turn evangelical for anything, but in this case, it's positive. He made me realize how negative my thoughts have been lately. How small I've been thinking. So negative I'm disgusted with myself. I will stop using the word 'try' and use the word 'MUST.' It's amazing how much difference a word and thought makes in your life. So I MUST come up with a study and work schedule on Sunday and I MUST follow through with that schedule. There! That's settled then. A paradigm shift in actions and thought.\n\nWell, Kings has gotten himself a girlfriend. Wouldn't have thought that would happen anytime soon. But life can sometimes blindside you when you least expect it. So there it is. My kemosabe in bachelorhood arms has deserted me. Can't say I blame him though. Except the reason for him to get together with this girl is rather suspect. I'll never be sure whether he got together with her just to prove to himself that he could get a girlfriend or that he's really sincerely into this girl. Only way to find out is to just ask him directly, but that would just make our friendship take a weird turn. Oh well.\n\nSo, onto something else. Been a long while since I added any new entries. But hot damn! Lazy bones strikes again. Sometimes I wonder why I bothered to have a blog in the first place. Well, it's the school holidays now. Finished the exams. I hope to pass all four papers. Anyway, the accounts paper was a bust. Same feeling as the stats paper last semester. Probably gonna flunk accounts. But there's always a chance I'll pass, right? Well, tomorrow, or I should say today, I'm gonna go down to the registry of companies and I'm gonna register a business partnership with Kumar. It's been a long time coming. Gonna call the new company 'Epac Trading Company' in honour of the earlier supposed but on hold partnership with the other two future partners for Entrepac. Well, we'll see what happens tomorrow then. Oh and I'm working on tradenet now. Damn I loathe programming. But I gave my word that I'll do it and I don't like to break it. Though sometimes there are extenuating circumstances. Heck, there's always an excuse not to do something, right?\n\nI just read this article, specifically the section referring to the remarks made by Bill Cosby. In it he talks about the culture of victimism in America. This got me to think about the culture of victimism in the civilised world as we know it today. I get tired when I hear people blaming everything but themselves for their less than desired life situations. Or saying it's meant to be. In my humble opinion, unless you are mentally incapacitated, you, and only you, are responsible for the life you lead. There is no two ways about it. What's the point of blaming everything for your troubles? Why not get off your ass and do something about it? I'd like to think that I am doing so through actively taking actions that have a specific life goal in mind. You can't go anywhere if you don't have anywhere you want to go to. So I suppose the key is that you should decide upon a goal that you want to strive towards. But it's not just goal setting that's important. It must be with a sense of discipline that you work towards your goal with. Though that by no means guarantees success, success cannot be achieved otherwise.\n\nSlept at 10 last night. That's something I haven't done in such a long time. I actually can't remember the last time I went to bed before midnight. There's just so many better things to do than sleep. Guess it finally caught up with me. Woke up at half past 11 the next morning. A good 13 1/2 hours of sleep. Funnily enough, it wasn't as refreshing as I would have thought it would have been. I could actually stay awake throughout the lecture today. Can't say the same thing about paying attention though. That's what getting enough Zs can do for you. I must study econ tomorrow. Yes. Must. That's the power of suggestion. Saying and thinking are two totally different things when you turn them into action. Saying that you MUST instead of saying that you will TRY. Now I know. So I MUST complete the first three topics tomorrow. Not that I've got any better things to do. Yes, I know it's ambitious considering my procrastinative past. But I MUST do it. After all, I am answering it MYSELF. And lying to yourself is far worse than lying to anyone else, wouldn't you agree?\n\nWell, it's a week and a half till the next semester begins. Man, the holidays flew past in a blink of an eye, didn't they? This is probably the last holiday that I will have to just laze around and do pretty much nothing. The next holiday, at the end of this year, I'll probably be busy with the DPP project (one big mother of a research project) and with the starting up of the tuition centre. The following holiday, during mid 2005, I'll be in Melbourne at RMIT, for most of that month. So that doesn't leave much time for breathers in between. Phew! From here on out, it'll be one mad rush. And that's just the beginning of life then. I look toward it with mixed feelings really. On one hand, it'll be great to be able to start earning my keep. But on the other hand, I don't want to leave the security of school so soon. But time marches on. And there is nothing anyone can do about it. All I can do is to face it head on and hope that life doesn't chew me up and spit me out. But that's just being pessimistic. Remember the glass is half full!\n\nWell, I was just in one of my rhetoric moods just now. I was thinking of how sad it was that good friends can grow apart as you grow up. You gain new perspectives as you grow and those might now be the same as your friends. Like you're in different realities. Sometimes you grow apart because of differing views and sometimes it's because of circumstances. Some of which are not under your control but most of which are. Things like gaining new ideological beliefs, new social groups or just something as simple as getting a new job. Any of which can cause you to not make contact as often as you would like. I used to believe that it was their fault for not keeping in touch. But then I realized that I was as much at fault as anyone else in my life. People walk in and walk out of your life. You can try to keep them from walking out but ultimately, it's their choice. Guess that's why you have to choose your friends carefully. But then again, if you are too guarded in your choices, you might be artificially restricting yourself. Ah the choices we all make. I've had many good people in my life. It's sad to reminisce on the good times past as you know the chances of regaining those times are slim to none. So there's no use dwelling on them. But you don't want to discount their value in helping to shape you into the person that you are today. And yet, you don't want to let them hold you back from becoming the person that you're going to be tomorrow. Sigh.\n\nThis doesn't happen much when you're a teenager but it starts when you reach adulthood. You wish to be as carefree as you were then. Letting your parents worry for you. Reality was just for other people. You lived in a cocoon, in your own world. Ah the good old days.",
            "Well, another tale of German colonial rule to ponder upon. We all know how infamous it was for its cruelty, with the Ovaherero and Nama genocide in South West Africa being a stark testament. But let's not oversimplify things. The German colonial empire was as varied as the lands it conquered, with diverse policies and ruling styles. Educational provision followed suit, with significant differences across colonies. Now, when the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a well-educated African population to their surprise. Similarly, German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were met with praise by contemporary authors.\n\nBut you know what was quite different? South West Africa, now Namibia. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a crucial role in schooling natives, the natives' education was mostly left to missionary societies with limited government support. The Europeans, however, got the royal treatment - state schools were established, and missionary schools were heavily supported and regulated. These policies had long-lasting effects on Namibia, even after the Germans were gone. Other German colonies had literate Africans, but in Namibia, the majority remained uneducated and illiterate.\n\nWhy the stark contrast? Social, political, and economic factors played a huge part. This paper wants to delve into these factors, focusing on new research on how settlers and colonial authorities viewed the native Africans.\n\nResearch on colonial education is vast, with many sources in German from the early twentieth century. These works aimed to describe educational systems. Later English studies compared and analyzed these systems, highlighting significant differences. Cohen's work on education in South West Africa and East Africa is particularly notable, comparing the two colonies and discussing the factors behind their differences. The large settler population in South West Africa, Cohen argues, explains many differences in its educational system.\n\nNow, let's talk climate. South West Africa had a moderately pleasant climate, with many desert areas. This hospitable environment attracted a significant European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites lived there, while East Africa, the next largest settler colony, had only 5,336.",
            "So, let's talk about the evolution of popular music over the past century. Popular music has grown into a sprawling landscape with so many genres that it's tough to list them all. But let's zero in on one of the most diverse and expressive genres: Heavy Metal. This genre has been around for about 40 years and has spawned a plethora of sub and sub-sub genres, each with its unique sound. Heavy Metal is known for its wide range of emotions, mainly leaning towards the darker side of the spectrum. It's diverse and flexible, allowing musicians to create their own niches and sub-genres.\n\nToday, the Heavy Metal scene is chock-full of different groups, making it hard to pin down exactly what Heavy Metal is. It's difficult to understand the current metal music landscape without first grasping what the Heavy Metal movement is and why it's more than just a genre.",
            "A few decades before the Surrealists started painting their dreamlike masterpieces, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the renowned Post-Impressionist artist, captures not only a woman in awe of her dreamland but also Rousseau’s own personal aspirations as an artist. Since he started his journey, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and praise from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, yet faced a tough internal dilemma: whether to conform to or mimic certain painting styles to gain acceptance or to remain creatively independent and unique. The Dream is Rousseau’s magnum opus that best reflects his career-long struggle to choose between these two paths.\n\nTo understand The Dream through this lens, one must first delve into Rousseau’s biography. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed bourgeois prosperity. Unlike his peers, Rousseau didn’t receive formal art training; instead, he worked as a gabelou—a municipal toll service employee—until the age of forty. He was known as douanier, a customs inspector. The death of his first wife, Clémence, followed by the loss of eight infant children left Rousseau with only one daughter, Julia, and deep grief. Painting became his refuge and fresh start.\n\nRousseau’s desire for art world acceptance is understandable given his context. He was uneducated in formal painting and began late in life, working alongside other talented but more famous artists. He longed for recognition like Matisse, but their motivations differed. Matisse feared painting tritely, while Rousseau sought a conventional style to be admitted to the Artiste Français.",
            "Many a great thinker has pondered the deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there's a fundamental reason for this. As John Keats asserts in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience. Yet, we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being formally taught in these ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are attempts to describe rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are usually efforts to explain why something is beautiful or moral, rather than rules for creating or judging good art or moral behavior.\n\nCritiquing art or morals often falls short of capturing their essence. For instance, a discussion about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might revolve around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but these don't explain why it's considered good art. Often, when asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people say, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more complex explanation. Both art and morals can't be fully reduced to their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor notes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics shares this transcendental nature. As Wittgenstein suggests, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. /\" It's this \"je ne sais quoi,\" this ineffable quality, that makes both art and morality so powerful and links them together.\n\nI believe morality and art are closely related because we experience them most deeply at a noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They affect us at a level we can experience but not fully explain. This connection is strongest in literature. As McKean states, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Today's Germany stands tall as a united nation, with a unique cultural fusion that stretches from the foothills of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This rich cultural tapestry is felt from Cologne by the Rhine, through the heart of Germany, to the Elbe's banks in the Saxon city of Dresden. Given this unique heritage, it's not surprising that modern Germany is a blend of diverse origins and tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral home of the Germans, has a name shrouded in debate among scholars and historians. While Tacitus believed the name stemmed from a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, and others argue it derived from a Gallic word or an Old Irish word, 'garim' meaning 'to shout', the exact origin remains uncertain. For instance, Tacitus wrote in his AD 98 work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\", that he considered the Germans to be indigenous and not mixed with other races. He further noted that no one would willingly leave the warmth of Rome for the harsh climate and tough ways of Germania unless it was their home. Indeed, as the Germanic tribes started appearing in the mid-first century, they lived on the empire's borders, trading goods and skills with the Romans. The Romans would occasionally send expeditions to these lands, but they usually returned to their vast empire, leaving the Germanic tribes to live on the frontier.",
            "Downwards, I stared, my mind blankly comprehending the view before me. Silent, unemotionally, my practiced awareness studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding. Thoughts slipped in and out almost faster than they appeared, my consciousness working so smoothly and cleanly that it felt like I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. Once, following advice from an artist I worked with, I bought an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I'd wanted to learn how to draw since I was six, and this book teaches everything from understanding a pencil to processes the brain uses to interpret lines. One technique it teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study, transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture into an easily grasped one. Staring down at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't mentally project that artist’s frame. I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment. Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown. Fingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightening and relaxing as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness. Muscles tightened, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxiously the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again. The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet. Mop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt. Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "So, another year is coming to a close, and let me tell you, it's been more than a little bit of a shock. Teenagers are dying behind the wheel, and it's a grim reality that's been building for some time. The National Institutes of Health has been saying it all along: the teen brain just isn't ready for the dangers of driving, and that inexperience is at the root of it all. Not only does this lead to more accidents, but it also increases the risk of rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. And when you add in the fact that teens often drive with their peers—because, let's face it, that's how they roll—well, it's a perfect storm of disaster.\n\nSeveral states have tried to put a stop to this with temporary provisional licenses that limit driving hours and prohibit other teens as passengers. But let me tell you, these are just Band-Aid solutions. The issue is that, as a group, the youngest drivers just aren't equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities. Even seasoned psychologists like Marvin Zuckerman think that 18 is too young to issue a regular driver's license. USA Today reports that he's done research showing that teens under 19-20 are still on a high-risk thrill-seeking streak. It makes sense then to delay driving until that tendency starts to level out. If we keep giving licenses to young teens now, we're setting ourselves up for a whole lot of tragedy in the upcoming years. By 2010, the Baby Boomer's babies will be ready to hit the road, and millions of new teen drivers will be on the streets.\n\nWhat we need is straightforward legislation. Schools could keep teaching driver's education, but no one under 18 could be driving a car. A provisional permit could still be issued, and a set number of practical training hours would be required. California, for instance, currently requires 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. Since this is a problem that affects teens across the country, uniform, national legislation would be a sensible and effective way to protect teens everywhere.\n\nNow, this idea isn't exactly new, but it's time for action. We can't keep looking the other way while our teens are dying behind the wheel. It's time for a change.",
            "So I decided to take a look at the Library of Congress’s collection of early Edison films. I wanted to check out all of the trick films, which numbered fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films are known for their creative editing techniques used to create illusions. My study mainly involved describing the poetics of most trick films and looking at the unique traits in a few of the later ones. Most of these films were set-bound, using a frontal proscenium, and had no camera movement. Typically, long and medium shots were employed, and each trick film was composed of one shot. However, some films from the early 1900s dared to break these rules by including multiple shots.\n\nOne common feature among these trick films is their filming within an interior set, framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera doesn't move from its proscenium position to follow characters or objects. This style was heavily influenced by theatre and vaudeville and magic acts. One example is Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right and move back and forth horizontally. Even when they exit the frame, the camera doesn't follow them. This composition led to shots being long and medium in nature, borrowing from theatre traditions where the audience views the entire performance within the stage's borders. Actors seldom moved towards the camera, so close-ups weren't used.\n\nTrick films typically follow the rule of one conceptual shot equaling a single film, limiting their length to about a minute or less. This also restricted their dramatic or narrative usage, with most focusing on short vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts with little story. However, in trick films, a conceptual shot might consist of several physical shots joined together to create illusions of apparition or disappearing, like in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). A careful watch reveals the moment when the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” starts, though the film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor from Caroline was an early and passionate advocate for Republicanism. Despite being primarily an agriculturalist and having a short career in politics, he was renowned for his commitment and outspoken nature in matters of personal liberty and governance. His dedication to agriculture and his political experiences shaped his strong opinions on sovereignty, the Constitution, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw the United States as having a unique chance to establish an ideal system, as there were no native traditions to hinder its creators. He believed in the innate rights of man and their interdependence, arguing that if one right was denied, all would fail, and the remaining rights would be less valuable. These rights, he thought, should be outside the government's reach. He believed that a \"state of nature\" allowed the powerful and cunning to thrive, but in a society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must acknowledge the inherent good and evil within humanity. He was rigid in his belief that morality was dualistic, asserting, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He defined good principles as those that protected private property, promoted agriculture, and discouraged capitalism. A government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its leaders, who would inevitably be driven by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, Taylor believed, was a powerful force but only became evil when it led to sub-societies exploiting others. A good government, he argued, was needed to control man's natural evil and should be closely monitored to prevent the adoption of harmful principles.\n\nLike many Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a limited Federal government, with no more rights or powers than explicitly stated. He recognized that an extensive Federal government could be expensive and potentially oppressive. However, he believed that a strict, literal interpretation could become corrupt without considering the intent of the founders. Furthermore, he viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly described the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Well, another month has gone by, and I have a whole bunch of stuff to talk about that happened. First off, take a look at Figure 17, and you'll see a noticeable drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of our project. That's a bit of a bummer because I'm not sure why that happened. I mean, it’s New England, so the weather could be a factor with people not commuting by bike or on foot due to the cold. Also, it's the end of the fall semester, so everyone's heads are down doing schoolwork or processing grades. And December brings the holiday season, so some folks might have just forgotten about filling out the commuter log. Plus, classes don't resume until late January, and that could also account for the low numbers in February. But none of that explains the February dip. It's possible that projects like this start with a lot of energy and excitement, which naturally wears off over time. To counteract this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March to give the project a boost, and it did help increase log submissions. So, we faced the challenge of keeping the momentum going, especially with the holiday and semester breaks that are common in higher education. Another hurdle is that people just really enjoy driving their cars, which is deeply ingrained in our culture. To get folks interested in alternative commuting, we handed out a ton of gift certificates to all sorts of places like local restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. We even considered giving away bicycles or hybrid cars, which could have helped combat that dip in engagement. The prizes we offered were pretty solid at first, but if we had announced bigger prizes like bikes or hybrid cars throughout the project, it might have kept participation higher. For instance, announcing a bike giveaway in December and a hybrid or electric car giveaway in January could have increased engagement instead of it decreasing.",
            "So here's a quick rundown on ETFs. An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that mirrors an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but it's more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange. You get the diversification of an index fund and the perks of single stock ownership, such as the ability to sell short, buy on margin, or purchase as few as one share in any transaction. These benefits are quite appealing, but ETFs typically have lower expense ratios than average mutual funds. The downside is you have to pay a commission for any trades involving ETFs, just like with stock orders. Another upside is the wide variety of funds available. But hey, it's always good to check if these stated benefits, like diversification, actually materialize and to what extent. For now, let's look at the ETF IHF and compare it against its top 10 holdings, which make up 63.58% of all assets in the ETF. Below are these top 10 holdings and their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can normalize the current % of assets to 100% and calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio’s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks, in the proportion they have in the ETF. Here are the calculations:\n\nFrom this chart, it's clear that a portfolio consisting of only the top 10 holdings has a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, which is a 16% increase. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. So, it looks like a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could yield higher returns with a lower Beta. However, these two portfolios might not be statistically different from each other.\n\nTo determine if these portfolios are indeed statistically different, we need to calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's standout poems is \"Dream-Land.\" In this work, he employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced back by Mabbott to Virgil. Virgil utilized the term for an island north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world. While Virgil did indeed use the term, there's a more contemporary source to which some credit should be given. Poe was particularly captivated by German authors.\n\nThis is notable as it reveals Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon,\" discusses the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe was likely imitating Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was famous for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's death. Within Faust's second part lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" In this piece, a king loses his wife after she gives him a goblet. Upon his wife's passing, he becomes a heavy drinker and mourns, eventually deciding it is time for him to die. He bestows his possessions on his children, except for the goblet, which he throws into the ocean before dying. The King of Thule and the description in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, possibly serving as a dark reflection of Poe's own struggles and reliance on drinking as a coping mechanism. Faust was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, only a year before Poe’s use of the term \"Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe mentions \"ultma Thule\" once in his collected works, but he uses the term \"Thule\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" bookending the poem. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be considered companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes the landscape of Thule, a dark and lonely place haunted by dead friends, and sees a world shaded without color. These scenes echo \"The King of Thule\" by Goethe, as the king is in mourning, lonely, and has lost the will to rule or live. The entire poem reads as if the speaker has stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe was a significant writer whose work Poe would have known, not only through his admiration for Tennyson but also through the many reproductions of his works after their original publication.",
            "Under California law, could a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by proving the store manager acted with malice? Specifically, the manager was informed twice about the spill but failed to clean it for half an hour because he was having dinner. A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's punitive damage claim outright. To succeed, she must show that the manager's actions were willful and conscious disregard for the likely harm, and that the actions were despicable. Palmer could argue that the manager should have known about the probable harm since multiple customers were injured from slipping before her accident. She might also claim that the manager's failure to address the spill was despicable, considering there were already six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed the manager about the applesauce spill. The manager responded that he was on dinner break and didn't have time to deal with it. Another employee notified the manager about the spill at 5:15 pm, and the manager gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D Markets in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages, and we are considering filing a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. In California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have considered conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of their conduct and deliberately failed to avoid them.",
            "So, four years ago, I enrolled in a CBC course on Islam. The main topic of debate in the class was whether Islam is inherently hostile. I find this question more pertinent now than ever, given the shift in mass media's perception of Islam post-9/11. In 2001, I couldn’t have imagined a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with a Muslim background, becoming a reality in America. It’s fascinating how the media’s view has swung from hostility to extreme tolerance.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography piqued my interest. According to historical accounts, Muhammad’s rise to power and the spread of Islam contradict the image of him portrayed in the biography. I've always heard that Muhammad forced conversions, conquering tribes and imposing Islam upon them. However, the biography presents him as a humble martyr, misunderstood and even humbled. People slowly came to recognize the 'truth' in his teachings and sought him out.\n\nThere are striking parallels between Muhammad's 'miracles' and Jesus' ministry. For instance, Muhammad multiplied a small amount of mutton and milk to feed forty men, a feat reminiscent of Jesus' own miracle. This style of writing makes Muhammad seem like a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles. This downplays the miracle and life of Jesus, making it seem like Muhammad is being used to take credit for Jesus' life and personhood.\n\nMoreover, the biography often presents stories of self-proclaimed converts to Islam, illustrating that they 'found the truth' on their own. However, many of these accounts are third-hand, with the author relaying stories heard from others. I find this method unconvincing because it makes the stories seem less credible and more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most is how the biography elevates Muhammad, depicting him as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man. However, historical records show Muhammad was not as gentle and humble as presented. I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power.",
            "The teachings of Jesus, as he held them during his lifetime, were swiftly set aside in the evolution of Christian thought following his life. If we observe this historical trajectory in broad terms, we notice a pattern of Christianity straying increasingly from its origins. Today, the world exhibits a growing awareness and unprecedented progressive tendency. While traditionalists persist and resist any thinking beyond what they've been taught, this segment of the population might not have a substantial impact on the whole. Among Christians, historical awareness will significantly increase in future years. There will be a rising desire to differentiate the doctrines that have been added to Christianity over time from Jesus' original intentions. This process may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable: a reversal in the trend of Christian history. A movement will grow in numbers, peeling away layers of doctrine, as if the clock were turning backward, until only the core of Jesus' teachings remain. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing the masses to worship as they did in Jesus' time, adhering solely to his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to guide the way. However, as the theological clock moves backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity within Christendom will reverse into greater uniformity of belief and practice. Between regions, denominations, and divisions, we'll see increasing similarities. Human history is filled with such reversals. For instance, Christians were once persecuted, shunned, and killed by the Roman Empire, but later the empire itself became a Christian institution. Our nation has moved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The great reversion coming in our future will play out in the realm of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source and reducing diversity in the process. What's more, it will become common to read Jesus' words metaphorically, not as literal statements. So, what changed since Jesus' lifetime?\n\nLooking back through history, we find that Judaism was the theological foundation for Christianity. Monotheism, the belief in a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were all central to the religion by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish population was not united. They were divided into factions like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots, with the majority being ordinary people.",
            "Another text that illustrates the inherent greed and self-centeredness of people is \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair. This novel reveals how, at their core, humans are driven to prioritize their own interests and comfort, often neglecting those less fortunate. The owners and directors of the massive factories in the story exemplify this; their sole focus is on expanding their businesses regardless of the consequences. Sinclair uses vivid imagery to depict the detrimental effects of this unchecked power, describing the factories as \"a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds,\" with \"great chimneys\" spewing smoke and \"massive\" piles of animal waste. The workers are also subjected to harsh conditions, with employers prioritizing profits over their employees' well-being. With minimal legal protections and worker representation, the environment is akin to a system of slavery, with workers \"dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "Fitzgerald employs various techniques to evoke certain feelings or attitudes in his readers regarding crucial themes in \"The Great Gatsby.\" Some of these approaches are more potent than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald utilizes a mix of adjective-noun pairings and symbolism in his novel to achieve this. He pairs seemingly mismatched adjectives and nouns to create a specific atmosphere around certain subjects. For instance, he often uses color to convey deeper meanings. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald assigns symbolic significance to colors like gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. He builds up these meanings and then later uses them to evoke feelings around key objects.\n\nWhite and gray are significant colors in Fitzgerald's novel. White symbolizes elegance and refinement, while gray represents aging and fading. He reinforces these meanings throughout the story. Daisy and Jordan wear white frequently, as do other characters in various scenes. For example, when Nick attends Gatsby’s party, he observes that people are dressed in white flannels, while Tom is seen in a white shirt when he meets Myrtle. Notably, only when Nick gets impressions of Gatsby’s party do people not wear white, suggesting a shift in importance. Common or unimportant subjects are also described in these colors: Nick travels “down the white chasms of lower New York,” and people at Gatsby’s party have “gray names.” Even mundane characters and settings are described in this way, such as Jordan and Daisy’s “white girlhood,” the “gray cars” and “gray land” in the valley of ashes, and the “gray” Italian child in the railroad.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald establishes the meanings of white/gray, he uses them to underscore unimportance or uniformity. This technique starts with Daisy. After a prolonged period without noticeable use of these colors, Daisy is described as wearing white in a white roadster. This description signals to readers that Daisy is less of a central character and more of a uniform addition to the story, someone Gatsby longs for. Fitzgerald uses similar descriptions of Daisy to reinforce this impression, such as her “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” and her white dress during the encounter between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "San Diego County is a hot spot for agriculture due to its warm, sunny climate. The region is known for growing tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a thriving market for organic, community-supported agriculture, with many local groups having long waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also highly sought after in the San Diego area. Many organic farms offer tours and recreational activities like hiking and birdwatching, thereby allowing the landowner to enjoy the benefits of government programs while enhancing biodiversity and creating additional income streams. This type of operation not only fills a potentially profitable niche but also promotes a healthier environment by reducing chemical use, which in turn boosts both plant and wildlife diversity.\n\nHowever, organic farming comes with its own set of challenges. It demands more intensive labor for pest control, weed management, and soil fertilization without chemicals. Furthermore, it can be less efficient and more costly than conventional farming, with smaller farms lacking the economies of scale. Additional wildlife-friendly practices, like planting cover crops or managing grazing rotation, can also increase labor costs. For these reasons, a landowner in this scenario might consider seeking financial assistance or expert advice to optimize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land in question is a 160-acre parcel near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It's a mix of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan currently identifies over a hundred plant and animal species, including several endangered ones like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as species that may soon be listed as declining.\n\nHistorically, the land was inhabited by Native Americans and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This parcel was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and wood production over many decades. I selected this property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see how a small farmer might reduce costs and maintain wildlife-friendly farming practices. As a model, I looked at an organic farm in the same area.",
            "So another month has gone by, and once again, I find myself reflecting on how culture plays a substantial role in any negotiation. Culture, you see, is not a monolith, but rather a living thing that's as much about what it is not as what it is. It's not singular, uniform, or homogenous. Saying \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are oversimplifications, though understanding those generalizations can be beneficial. But it's far more practical for a negotiator to focus on how the culture's attitudes and values will impact the negotiations at hand. When encountering a foreign culture, it's natural to compare it to our own, which can present its own set of challenges.",
            "The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" The preceding quotation is found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and it serves as the opening point for St. Anselm's argument regarding the existence of God. A similar belief is held by another author we will discuss, St. Thomas Aquinas. Since both arguments argue for the existence of the same divine entity, our task is to determine whose argument is more compelling. For the sake of conciseness, we'll assume they're both correct in their belief in the biblical God. To explore their arguments fairly, we must consider a specific concept of God, as their defenses are tailored to that.\n\nStarting with St. Anselm's basic argument, he suggests that understanding God begins with faith and self-reflection. He posits that because God's existence is inherent in our understanding, we cannot imagine Him not existing. While his concept can be somewhat obscure and complicated, the core idea is that God's proof lies within our own minds. We don't need external evidence; instead, we discover the truth about God through introspection. This is often referred to within Christianity as faith.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, however, argues that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, without requiring faith. This approach could be advantageous for evangelism, as it would allow for the persuasion of new converts based solely on logic. Aquinas presents five logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates that God's existence is logically necessary.",
            "So, way back in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a man was born who would later come to be known as Buddha. After a life of renouncing the world, he attained enlightenment, and his teachings spread, eventually leading to the formation of Buddhism—the most traditional branch of which is called Theravada Buddhism. This religion is now around twenty-five hundred years old, and it's changed a lot since Buddha's time. For instance, in Sri Lanka, where Theravada Buddhism is practiced, the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Though Buddha never taught about such festivities, monks and laypeople alike participate, highlighting how the religion has evolved. These changes can be seen in everything from surface-level traditions to the very core of the religion's teachings. The Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time due to both internal and external influences, some hostile and some benign.\n\nThere are some key terms we'll use often in this discussion: internal versus external, and hostile versus benign. Internal forces are those that come from within the Buddhist community, no matter the monastic status. External forces are anything from outside the community. A hostile force is anything that harms or intends to harm the Buddhist community, often due to a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force, on the other hand, doesn't mean to harm or help the community—though it might end up doing so.\n\nFirst, let's look at the basics of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially made up of the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka sets out the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, like Anatta (no self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Only by understanding these concepts can one escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth. This escape also involves the elimination of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), when one becomes enlightened.\n\nIn the Vinaya Pitaka, there are rules for laypeople and monks alike. Laypeople follow the Five Precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). Monks have many more rules to follow. The most fundamental teaching in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, life is suffering (Dukkha). Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico once shared a 57-year rivalry, from 1836 to 1893, with the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848 being the peak of their rivalry. This period saw many skirmishes before the First World War, with disputes often stemming from differences in religion, culture, and traditions, as well as competing material interests. Many nations with shared borders face similar situations, with David M. Pletcher noting that only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting, overarching American diplomatic problems. These nations are close geographically to the United States and have historically been rivals, while others in Latin America have maintained better relations. Religious differences, like those between the United States and Mexico, have caused rifts throughout history, similar to the ideological struggles during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Diehl and Goerts list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States during this period, with most being territorial issues related to border raids and frontier problems. Schmitt explains that the rivalry began to ease as Mexico grew more dependent on the United States, and it ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, I was suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I had never known existed. Prior to this, I was a nurse, having chosen this profession out of a strong desire for the stability and security I lacked as a child. The phrase, \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick,\" echoed through my adolescence and beyond, guiding me towards nursing. Despite my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist, I found solace in the predictability of my chosen profession.\n\nYet, here I am: 46 years old, single, and unable to work, with no savings and living on Social Security Disability. After 15 years, I have nothing to call my own. Every day is a struggle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-esteem. Nothing is certain anymore, but one thing is clear: I could not have survived this long without the help of my family and a few good friends. When disaster strikes, you feel weak, no matter how strong you are.\n\nMy point is that life, both big and small, presents emergencies. There are no guarantees, and no matter how well you prepare, some things are too vast to overcome alone. While I agree that we should reduce our reliance on big government, I believe in the power of community. We should relearn to trust and help each other rather than each of us building our own fallout shelters.\n\nConservatives often praise \"rugged individualism\" as the nation's backbone, but our forefathers' resilience was built on compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. Pioneers crossing the Rockies didn't make it alone; they traveled in wagon trains, supporting each other.\n\nSo, yes, be prepared. I have a disaster kit, including first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and flashlights. But while you're preparing, get to know your neighbors. Trust and community are just as important as personal preparedness.",
            "So, why do organisms evolve as they do? Are there any restrictions or constraints that dictate the direction of evolutionary change? Back in 1917, D'Arcy Thompson had this to say: \"Even now, the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" Yet, we find ourselves still grappling with the same question today. Fortunately, mathematical modeling has made strides in understanding various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis, both through ontogeny and phylogeny. Our research explores how these mathematical models, combined with experimental studies, can shed light on the mechanisms driving the direction and scale of evolutionary-change in Prunum. We've utilized X-radiographic images of Prunum species to quantify parameters that can be used to model both hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell. We then modeled hypothetical shell morphologies to interpret possible morphological changes in Prunum, merging these results with experimental and descriptive studies to better grasp macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a structure that winds around through 360 degrees of space over time. These turns, or whorls, spiral around an imaginary central axis, the columella, which runs through the shell's central column. The rate at which these whorls enlarge varies, and the continuous line separating each whorl is called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last, with the apex at the top and the base at the bottom. The animal exits the shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The usual orientation is the apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical side and determine where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell into two parts, and count from this line, estimating each whorl to a quarter of a full turn.\n\nA shell can also be seen as a series of apertures that traverse time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be tracked via the coordinates of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented. Once a formulation is created, parameters can be varied to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Well, I've been watching the stats on neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia for a while now, and it seems like there's barely been any progress over the last decade. While the country's on a good track to meet certain Millennium Development Goals, like water and sanitation, we're falling short on child and maternal health. There are a bunch of reasons why, and it seems like we need to focus more on strengthening the overall health system instead of just tweaking individual programs.\n\nWe've seen a decent improvement in the number of births attended by skilled health workers, with 72% meeting the target. But a lot of these are just traditional workers like midwives, who can't handle complicated pregnancies, leading to a lot of maternal deaths from things like hemorrhage. So, these improvements are a bit misleading, and we still have a lot of work to do. Plus, the percentage of children under five getting treatment for diarrhea has gone down, and data on postnatal care is all over the place.\n\nCesarean-section rates are still lower than they should be, around 4%, and there's a big gap between urban and rural rates. This shows that healthcare access is mainly focused on cities. And there's a huge gap in service use between the poorest and richest people, which is likely due to high out-of-pocket costs. So, we need to ask ourselves how to best tackle these issues. Should we focus on specific programs or strengthen the health system as a whole? There are pros and cons to both approaches.\n\nProgram-specific solutions are a great way to tackle specific problems, but they can also lead to duplication and lack of coordination. Plus, they might take funding away from other important areas. So, we need to find a balance to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocracy of the time. However, two notable exceptions are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which diverge from this norm by incorporating elements of mystery and surprise, atypical for the period. These elements enhance the characters within each work, deepening insights into their motivations and emotions. For instance, the protagonist in Oliver Twist experiences vivid dreamlike sequences that reveal his inner self, the struggles he faces, and his awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. When revisiting the event of his shooting in chapter 28, Oliver relives the experience in a dreamlike state, highlighting his lack of control over the events and the dire straits his health has been in. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit emphasize his despair, and the shooting itself numbs all his senses, leaving him feeling overwhelmed and defeated. This event raises questions about whose will is manipulating his misfortune, as it's clear it's not his own. The shooting also underscores Oliver's lack of control over life events, reinforcing the notion that he doesn't even attempt to assert control when his life is in danger. This suggests a growing sense of defeat, as if his mentor, Fagin, has begun to break him, compelling him to accept this despair and severely impacting his ability to react.",
            "A couple of years ago, I was tutoring in an after-school program for elementary-age students. My forte was English and reading, but I was recruited by a teacher to help a boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. He was in third or fourth grade, and something seemed off. He could pronounce certain letters perfectly, but others, not at all. I realized he could read but didn't know the English alphabet well. His mother spoke only Spanish, and with my limited Spanish, we communicated, but I understood then: Adrian needed tutoring in English reading, specifically on the alphabet and pronunciation. I'm not sure if this helped him much, but I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier in schools, especially in California. It's not always as apparent as we think. Even a child speaking perfect English may struggle with reading. Everyone agrees this problem exists, so what's the solution? For Adrian, it was simple: English reading tutoring. But for children barely speaking English, it's more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes—none alone will solve this. The key is combining all these approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is excellent. It benefits children whose first language is Spanish but also those learning English. Research shows children in bilingual programs outperform their peers. People fear it's a resource waste, but that's false. If implemented widely, all children would benefit. But how do we do it? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual? No, that's unreasonable. Instead, we could employ bilingual aids or tutors.",
            "From the time we are children, many of us are told that there is something out there that is larger than ourselves, something we can't fully understand. Some of us learn about it in Sunday school, others in temples, or within ourselves. We often accept the religions passed down by our parents, but some of us reject them completely, believing that there's nothing beyond our own personal egocentric universe. We may embrace one belief system only to later change our minds and adopt another. Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our unique spiritual perspectives. We search for a guiding light to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was. We were sitting on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain beat down on the tin roof as we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters were overflowing, drenching the plants along the edge of the porch. He stared out into the rain, a look that seemed both searching and reminiscing. He had grown gaunt over the past few months, his clothes hanging loosely on his frame, and his hair thinner and sparser than I remembered. He continued to gaze out into the rain, avoiding my eyes. I felt alone, scared, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because admitting it would only make it more real for both of us. I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair closer to his, and joined him in looking out into the June twilight rain.\n\nMy father passed away in December of that year, just five days after my twenty-second birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering but extended his life a few more months beyond what the doctors had predicted. I couldn't understand the value of this when it just meant more suffering. I thought to myself, \"What kind of God would do this?\" Alone in the night, I refused to pray. If God existed, I believed he had stopped listening to me long ago.\n\nI didn't want to watch him leave this life to enter another. So I didn't. I couldn't watch the life that created me as it ended. I wanted to remember my father by how he lived, not how he died. Besides, I knew my father better than anyone, better than his own family, and I was sure he wouldn't want his only child to be a spectator at his death. I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one even called me.",
            "So another month has passed, and of course, seeing as how my life is pretty much stagnant, nothing much happened. Well, except for the stuff I'm gonna talk about now. I finally completed the beta version of the tradenet website. Of course, this was after much dragging of both feet (well, waddaya expect?). Kept adding and improving it. Probably gonna register a domain and get the site up and running by the middle of January 04. The delay being attributed to a lack of funds, and a means of which to transfer it to the web hosting company. My partner is gonna get his credit card in January, so that's when we're gonna set up the site. And how could I forget the other main thing that happened. I flunked accounting. Oh my god. I flunked. I guess I could see it coming, from the moment I got out of the exam hall after the paper, I pretty much knew. I just flunked with 47 outta 100. I dunno. Is it worse flunking knowing that you are so close to passing or worse is you flunked badly? I'm guessing the former. Well, just cos it's borderline, I put in an appeal to the course coordinator. Not hoping for much but at least there is hope. On the bright side, I did get distinctions for law and economics. I suppose that if you like a course, you're more motivated to do well in it. But then, you'd like a course if you find it easy to understand. Hmm, a catch 22 situation. Well, Gonna get the appeal result this week. Crossing my fingers there. Other than those things of note, nothing much has happened. Guess that's it for now. Till next time.\n\nWell, I have this affliction called shyness. Every time I talk to strangers, especially to one of the opposite sex, I turn into jello. I can't think, I start to tremble and I basically just freeze up. It doesn't happen all the time nowadays but it happened today at the YEN meeting. I had to tell Genevieve that I hadn't received the invitation to the club mailing list yet. I thought I could do it without any trouble but I was obviously wrong. I suppose that I care too much about what others think of me and my personality and brain just shuts down. She was trying to be nice but I didn't react to her being nice to me very well at all. I hope I didn't look too much like a dweeb. But I'm working on this problem. That's one of the main reasons that I joined YEN in the first place. That is, to force myself into situations where I would have no choice but to interact with strangers, especially those from the opposite gender. I mean, if I want to get anywhere in life, I can't do it on my own. It's not to bad with people whom I know well, but there is still that niggling fear inside of me. That's why I've never had the nerve to get into any relationship. You have no idea how frustrating it is to want something so bad but are too god damned afraid to just reach out and get it. No matter what happens, I WILL overcome this disability, if you will. And the only way to do that is through increased interaction. The other problem I have is that of positive thinking which directly affects my motivation. I don't want to say it as it's too overused but it's the truth. It's all my parents' fault. Especially my mom. She's just so negative ALL the time. It might seem unfilial (I'm not known for that) to say this but it's all to do with her society and upbringing. They aren't generally known for their achievements. Now she's passed it on to me. The only positive thing is that now that I'm aware of this shortcoming, I can work towards eliminating it. I have to be smart about it. Talked to the yen guy I met through Darren. Damn. I can't recall his name. He's a total 'Adam Knoo' convert. It might be unwise to turn evangelical for anything but in this case it's a positive thing. He should know that fanatic behavior has a knack of turning people off. But the thing is that he made me realize how negative in my thoughts I've been lately. How small I've been thinking. So negative I am disgusted with myself. I will stop using the word 'tyr' and use the word 'MUST'. It's amazing how much difference a word and thought makes in your life. So I MUST come up with a study and work schedule on Sunday and I MUST follow through with that schedule. There! That's settled then. I paradigm shift in actions and thought.\n\nWell, Kings has gone and gotten himself a girlfriend. Well, smack me silly and turn me inside out. Wouldn't have thought that would happen anytime soon. Goes to show how life can sometimes blindside you when you least expect it. So there it is. My kemosabe in bachelorhood arms has deserted me. Can't say I blame him though. Except the reason for him to get together with this girl are rather suspect. I'll never be sure whether he got together with her just to prove to himself that he could get a girlfriend or that he is really sincerely into this girl. Only way to find out is to just ask him directly but that would just make our friendship take a weird turn. Oh well.\n\nDamn! Been a long while since I added any new entries (not that anyone would care of course) But hot damn! Lazy bones strikes again. Sometimes I wonder why I bothered to have a blog in the first place. Well, it's the school holidays now. Finished the exams. I hope to pass all four papers but we all hope for good things don't we. Anyway, the accounts paper was a bust. Same feeling as the stats paper last semester. Probably gonna flunk accounts. But there's always a chance I'll pass eh. Heck, same thing happened to stats last sm and I passed that one. So tomorrow, or I should say today, I'm gonna go down to the registry of companies and I'm gonna register a business partnership with Kumar. It's been a long time coming I can tell you that much. Gonna call the new company 'Epac Trading Company' in honor of the earlier supposed but on hold partnership with the other two future partners for Entrepac. Well, see what happens tomorrow then. Oh and I'm working on tradenet now. Damn I loathe programming. But I gave my word that I'll do it and I don't like to break it. Though sometimes there are extenuating circumstances. Heck, there's always an excuse to not do something eh.\n\nI just read this URL article, specifically the section referring to the remarks made by URL Bill Cosby. In it, he talks about the culture of victimism in America. This got me to think about the culture of victimism in the civilized world as we know it today. I get tired when I hear people blaming everything but themselves for their less than desired life situations. Or saying that it's meant to be. In my humble opinion, unless you are mentally incapacitated, you and only yourself are responsible for the life that you lead. There is no two ways about it. What is the point of blaming everything for your troubles? Why not get off your ass and do something about it? I'd like to think that I am doing so through actively taking actions that have a specific life goal in mind. You can't go anywhere if you don't have anywhere that you want to go to. So I suppose the key is to decide upon a goal that you want to strive towards. But it's not just goal setting that's important. It must be with a sense of discipline that you work towards your goal with. Though that by no means guarantees success, success cannot be achieved otherwise.\n\nSlept at 10 last night. That's something I haven't done in such a long time. I actually can't remember the last time I went to bed before midnight. There's just so many better things to do than sleep. Guess it finally caught up with me. Woke up at half past 11 the next morning. A good 13 1/2 hours of sleep. Funnily enough it wasn't as refreshing as I would have thought it would have been. I could actually stay awake throughout the lecture today. Can't say the same thing about paying attention though. That's what getting enough Zs can do for you. I must study Econ tomorrow. Yes. Must. That's the power of suggestion. Saying and thinking it are two totally different things when you turn them into action. Saying that you MUST instead of saying that you will TRY. Now I know. So I MUST complete the first three topics tomorrow. Not that I've got any better things to do. Yes, I know it's ambitious considering my procrastinative past. But I MUST do it. After all, I am answering it MYSELF. And lying to yourself is far worse than lying to anyone else, wouldn't you agree?\n\nIt's a week and a half till the next semester begins. Man, the holidays flew past in a blink of an eye, didn't they. This is probably the last holiday that I will have to just laze around and do pretty much nothing. The next holiday, at the end of this year, I'll probably be busy with the DPP project (one big mother of a research project) and with the starting up of the tuition center. The following holiday, during mid-2005, I'll be in Melbourne at RMIT, for most of that month. So that doesn't leave much time for breathers in between. Phew! From here on out, it'll be one mad rush. And that's just the beginning of life then. I look towards it with mixed feelings really. On one hand, it'll be great to be able to start earning my keep. But on the other hand, I don't want to leave the security of school so soon. But time marches on. And there is nothing anyone can do about it. All I can do is to face it head on and hope that life doesn't chew me up and spit me out. But that's just being pessimistic. Remember the glass is half full!\n\nWell, I was just in one of my rhetoric moods just now. I was thinking of how sad it was that good friends can grow apart as you grow up. You gain new perspectives as you grow and those might not be the same as your friends. Like you're in different realities. Sometimes you grow apart because of differing views and sometimes it's because of circumstances. Some of which are not under your control but most of which are. Things like gaining a new ideological belief, new social groups, or just something as simple as getting a new job. Any of which can cause you to not make contact as often as you would like. I used to believe that it was their fault for not keeping in touch. But then I realized that I was as much at fault as anyone else in my life. People walk in and walk out of your life. You can try to keep them from walking out but ultimately, it's their choice. Guess that's why you have to choose your friends carefully. But then again, if you are too guarded in your choices, you might be artificially restricting yourself. Ah the choices we all make. I've had many good people in my life. It's sad to reminisce on the good times past as you know the chances of regaining those times are slim to none. So there's no use dwelling on them. But you don't want to discount their value in helping to shape you into the person that you are today. And yet, you don't want to let them hold you back from becoming the person that you're going to be tomorrow. Sigh. This doesn't happen much when you're a teenager but it starts when you reach adulthood. You wish to be as carefree as you were then. Letting your parents worry for you. Reality was just for other people. You lived in a cocoon, in your own world. Ah the good old days.",
            "Alright, so supply chain management is all about moving goods from when you first get an order from a customer right down to when the product eventually reaches them. This term was coined in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. He described it as the process of planning, implementing, and controlling all the activities involved in the supply chain to ensure customer satisfaction in a quick and efficient manner. There are six main components to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers use these six elements to deliver the best possible service to their customers.\n\nStarting with production, which is the first and most crucial step in the supply chain. Production lays the groundwork for the entire process. Managers need to know what their customers want, so they look at the market to determine customer demand. Once they understand what customers need, they can decide what products to produce and how many of each to make. After that, they choose where to produce these products, considering factors like volume and quality, and always keeping customer satisfaction in mind.\n\nOnce the production location is set, managers focus on scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment. Production is a critical step, and every detail must be planned meticulously. For instance, I used to work at Wal-Mart and Target, and both companies have designed processes for every aspect of their operations. Having these outlined processes ensures smooth operation without confusion or misunderstandings about expectations and directions.\n\nThe next key element is supply. Supply involves making strategic decisions about the core capabilities of a facility and forming outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each with its own equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must choose the best division for each product process. They may also decide to outsource work to other companies to increase velocity. Velocity means providing quality and flexibility while keeping costs low or maintaining low cost levels.",
            "Every month that goes by, and I'm left here, barely moving. Not much happens, except for the tales I'm about to spin. In Burma, a sign reads that Hitler is alive. Ellen Page, the star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner, a cardboard message held high above her head, handwritten in Sharpie. Burma, or Myanmar, is a country ruled by a tyrannical military regime since 1962. In 2007, monks led a wave of public protests, known as \"The Saffron Revolution.\" Initially, the government allowed these peaceful gatherings, but soon violence erupted. Monasteries were invaded, and foreign journalists were imprisoned, with one photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, killed on Sept 27, 2007, just for being at a protest. The official death toll is 13, but Colonel Hla Win, a defector, claims thousands were killed.\n\nThis isn't new. Throughout history, governments have crushed dissent to maintain power. Roman emperors declared themselves divine rulers, Japanese emperors are believed to be gods, and our current president, George W. Bush, has a weekly meeting with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a branch of the Republican Party.\n\nTiananmen Square in 1989, where intellectuals and students protested authoritarian rule, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia slaughtered Tutsis and political moderates, are examples of this. Hitler's Third Reich, where Jews were systematically murdered, is another extreme case.\n\nThis is the reality of our world, where power is often wielded without regard for human rights.",
            "Well, Duke Ellington's name is synonymous with jazz for a reason. He had this uncanny ability to keep his orchestra together for decades, which allowed him to fully explore his creative prowess. While his keyboard skills were often understated in his compositions, as a composer, he was a master at crafting intricate pieces that highlighted each band member's unique abilities. Ellington created a framework where soloists could freely improvise, and he also wrote tightly orchestrated phrases that emphasized the specific styles of his musicians to bring out musical ideas. This balance of structure and freedom allowed him to create some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history. The Grove Music dictionary even mentions the Creole Love Call, an early example of Ellington's use of voice as a jazz instrument. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece showcases his ability to complement his soloists and add layers of sound. The piece features a call and response between voice and reeds, with different sections echoing and elaborating on the basic melody. The use of voice and tone color is a stylistic trait that runs throughout Ellington's work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color, creating a rich and complementary sound between a muted trumpet and scat singing. Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) showcases his use of muted trombone to great effect, further illustrating his mastery of individual sounds and their combination.",
            "So, I've always felt like I was missing something. It's been this persistent longing that just won't be satisfied. It started when I was 14, right as I was entering my teenage years, and it's still with me now, three years later, at 17. I've shifted my focus from wanting things to wanting someone, but none of the boys I've encountered have caught my interest. They've made their moves, but nothing has sparked my attention. I've spent the past few years questioning this, trying to make sense of it, but I haven't found any concrete answers yet. So, I just keep living my life, wondering about my unfulfilled desire.\n\nUsually, a day at home is peaceful and calm. My parents are great, never arguing with each other, and they hardly argue with me too, aside from when I assert my independence and free-spirited personality, which they don't quite agree with. They're the calm couple, and I'm the energetic one, which makes our family quite dynamic and fun. But today was far from peaceful.\n\nAs I was wandering around the house, trying to find some inspiration, I heard a sudden scream from the kitchen. It was my mom, and she was in pain. I rushed in to find her on the ground, saying \"ow\" in short, painful breaths. I put a hand on her to help her, and she asked me to take her to the hospital. I carried her to the car and drove her there quickly.\n\nThe hospital was filled with the usual medicinal smells and the scent of sickness, but I wasn't focusing on that. My mind was occupied with getting my mom the help she needed. I brought her inside, and the doctors took over. She had fallen off a stepladder while trying to get a vase from the highest shelf in the kitchen.",
            "So, I've got some news for you. This study was all about proving that sticking to a Mediterranean diet (Med diet), especially one that's high in \"alternative Mediterranean\" diet score, can lower your risk of chronic heart disease and stroke, as well as stroke-related death. Now, the alternative Mediterranean diet is basically a tweaked version of the traditional Med diet, focusing on eating more plant foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, and less animal products and saturated fats. It also allows for moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nNow, previous research has shown that following the Med diet can reduce the risk of dying from cardiovascular issues, and it's more effective than a low-fat diet for weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in overweight people. However, this study is one of the first to look specifically at stroke and stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a group of 121,700 nurses in 11 US states. Every six years from 1984 to 2004, these women filled out food frequency questionnaires, which were used to calculate their 'alternative Mediterranean' diet scores. These scores were based on their nutrient intake over the past year. Around 95% of these nurses stayed in the study for the entire 20 years. Their food intake data was validated, and reports of heart disease, stroke, and death were verified through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Cases where records weren't available were considered \"probable\" and included in the study.\n\nTo account for any individual variations and give a better representation of long-term eating habits, the study used average scores from two years of repeated questionnaires. Adjustments were made for factors that could skew the results, like age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study used a statistical method called Cox proportional-hazard modeling to see how these diet scores were linked to heart disease and stroke risks. The results? Women who stuck closely to the Mediterranean diet had a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. Over the 20 years, there were 2,391 new cases of heart disease, 1,763 cases of stroke, and 1,077 cardiovascular deaths. Those who scored highest on the alternative Mediterranean diet had a 29% lower risk of heart disease and stroke compared to those who scored the lowest.",
            "Alright, so let's rewind to 2007, and oh boy, did the United States face a real financial powder keg. Unemployment skyrocketed, the housing market tanked, and some of America's most pivotal corporations were left for dead. This economic downturn is still with us today, so let's delve into how this all went down and how we can prevent it from happening again. Well, the financial crisis was basically a result of arrogant and careless political decision-making that pushed banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans to an underdeveloped financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were pushed to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDS'. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks were left with insufficient capital reserves and passed the chaos onto the repacked mortgages they sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this disaster were planted in 1999 during the Clinton administration. The president was aiming for a second term and sought to boost his popularity by easing lending restrictions, which set the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times warned in 1999, “Fannie Mae has been pressured by the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people, and felt pressure from stockholders to maintain its impressive growth in profits.” Holmes accurately predicted the consequences: “But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue like that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As we see in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-fated lending led to the economy's meltdown.\n\nSeveral factors combined to bring the economy to its knees, one being the new and complex mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs were widely used in the lead-up to the crisis, further entangling the economy in the housing market. This led to households and financial markets over-leveraging in the housing market, making them extremely sensitive to price changes.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities in the red. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were quickly sold off cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks under intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie racked up $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",

In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order. As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes. You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each. You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on. You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat. (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*) Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things. Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.\n\nProvide your rewrite between [REWRITE] and",
            "Watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, which was a live segment, was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The headline was about a man named Shad Hostettler from Ashley, Ohio, who had stabbed his wife. Her name was not mentioned, but his mug shot showed a man who looked menacing. They gave it a mere two minutes, which I thought was sufficient given it was still unfolding. The only details they provided were that he had stabbed her multiple times and was arrested. I thought they gave it appropriate coverage.\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and no arrests had been made. The SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed short, and I believe that might have been due to a racial bias. I've noticed over the years that minority victims of crime, especially black ones, often get less attention. For instance, if a white child or adult is kidnapped or a victim of a crime, the media goes into overdrive, but minority victims often get bypassed.\nThe next story was about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about the incident's location, and it was determined to be a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for tips leading to the shooter's arrest.\nThe next story was about rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They predicted mid to low eighties for the weekend, but the news was short and served as a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\nAnother story was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. A dark-skinned black man, described as about six-foot tall and 150 pounds, was the suspect. He was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They devoted an unusual amount of time emphasizing his race and how dark he was.\nThe final story was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin, who had been sentenced to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. Instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years, they said \"300\" months. I'm not sure why they used this phrasing; perhaps to make the sentence sound more harsh. They also mentioned he was Hispanic, which I didn't think was relevant to the story.",
            "There exists a special bond between brothers; one that's unbreakable and irrevocable, carrying with it a mix of emotions like love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty. These siblings understand each other more than anyone else could, and seeing their reflection in each other's eyes reveals their true selves. This bond shows its true colors in dire situations, be it for good or ill, and the consequences of these emotions are substantial. By facing these feelings head-on, one can begin to grasp the reality of the bond and the impact it has on their character. “The Scarlet Ibis” explores this theme through the vivid descriptions of a captivating landscape and the interactions between the two brothers involved. The main character, Doodle, and the narrator's perspective present the complex emotions and viewpoints that shape their actions and drive their journey. One emotion stands out above the rest: pride. From their initial outings to their final, tragic adventure, the protagonist feels resentment towards his younger brother Doodle. He initially dreams of teaching him various skills, like holding his breath, running, and climbing, but Doodle's weak heart makes these dreams impossible. The protagonist's heart softens, though, when Doodle smiles at him, revealing a deep-seated love within him.",
            "The human brain is a complex, imaginative information-processing machine. As technology evolved from simple to advanced, the analogies used to describe the brain also evolved. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a tome of written words, and most recently, to a computer. As you delve into the intricacies of the brain, remember that these analogies are limited in their usefulness and can lead to misleading conclusions.\n\nInformation processing commences with inputs from the sensory organs, converting physical stimuli like touch, heat, sound waves, or light particles into electrochemical signals. These sensory inputs are repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when contemplating an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing merges basic information such as color, direction, and border locations to determine the presence of a box. Top-down processing speeds up this recognition by leveraging decisions from earlier stages of bottom-up processing, potentially helping you recognize the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped void in the white background.\n\nOnce information is sufficiently processed, an attention filter evaluates its importance and decides which cognitive processes it should be made accessible to. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you gaze at your shoes, a functional attention filter ensures that you don't notice each one individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name even when spoken amidst noise. There are numerous stages of information processing, with attention modulating the results at each stage.\n\nFor the brain to process information, storage is essential. Multiple types of memory exist, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. Each type of sensory stimulus has its own encoding method. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once information is stored, it must be retained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, active for about 20 seconds, is maintained through an electrical signal looping through specific neurons for a brief period. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be retained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nVarious models propose how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawn from human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented by nodes, and nodes are connected based on their relevance. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which could be linked to “wooden,” and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes aim at the impending threats of both technology and the capitalist system that perpetuates them through the creation of a dystopian society in Brave New World. The citizens are conditioned from birth to prioritize collective happiness over individuality, ensnared in a system that treats them as pawns in a grand game controlled by the World Controller. By examining his work through a Marxist lens, one can uncover Huxley's reservations about the evolution of these systems. Terms like homogeny and reification underscore his critique of the emergent economic order of his time.\n\nCapitalism is skewered through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the common people are blinded from understanding their economic relations to other classes. They are focused solely on personal gain, a result of ideological control, evident in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, are manipulated into a constant state of consumption and indulgence, oblivious to the manipulation. This is an example of hegemony, where the upper classes, though aware, do little to challenge the system. Interactions between social classes are a stark indicator of capitalist oppression.\n\nThe novel portrays a world where genuine human connections are absent. Characters are indistinguishable, even among the main ones, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is hinting that technology and capitalism together strip people of free will and individuality. Emotions like love and deep affection are nonexistent, with interactions kept superficial. For instance, men’s comments about women are often solely about their physical attributes, and women casually discuss their encounters. This societal complacency with their status within the hierarchy reflects Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority so long as they continue to consume and conform.",
            "So here I am, a student at University Park for a couple of years now, or roughly four and a half semesters to be specific. Navigating around campus can be quite a hassle, just as it is for many others. My first year, I was housed in an East Halls dorm room, pretty much the easternmost point of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Getting to classes like those in Willard building, smack dab in the middle of campus, could take up to a quarter of an hour on foot, especially if the weather wasn't cooperating, which is quite often in State College. I chatted with an older alum who told me that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by vast swathes of unused land. Now, that empty space is filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and apartments. As the campus expands, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. So, what's the best solution to this mobility issue? On a college campus, it's the bicycle. But a bike alone won't fix the problem. Students need to use them, and the campus must be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nI was talking to a friend who recently started cycling again after a few years' break. He admitted he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are fantastic,” he said, “they’re the only way to get around.” Cycling is not only good for your health but also the most efficient way to travel. A simple bowl of oatmeal and some physical activity can take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus, just as far from campus center as some dorms. The best decision I've made this year was to buy a bike. My daily class at Thomas building is a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. A bike can cut that time down to five minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only drawback is, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas from my house, isn't always the easiest road to ride. Walking is an option too, but I'm just too busy for it. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable way to get to class. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day, totaling more than two and a half hours every week. Add that to all the other time I'd need to walk for classes, appointments, and so on, and it's more time than I can spare."
