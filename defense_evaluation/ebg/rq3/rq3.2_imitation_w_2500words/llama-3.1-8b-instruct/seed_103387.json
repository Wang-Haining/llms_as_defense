            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I'm passionate about pursuing a career in social work, with a focus on helping children who have been abused or neglected, as well as supporting troubled families. Throughout my education, I've developed a set of core values that I believe are essential to this field: service, respect, an ethical nature, and a commitment to improving relationships and my own professional competence. These values are not just important to social workers, but also to me personally, as they reflect my own desires to help others and make a positive impact.\n\nAfter high school and college, I struggled to find a career path that aligned with my passions. Many people I met seemed to be avoiding their problems or using unhealthy coping mechanisms. Seeing this firsthand, I decided to pursue a degree in Psychology. Even after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted to do next. That all changed when I met a 16-year-old boy who was escaping his abusive parents. I drove to his parents' house with him and spoke with the police, expressing my concerns and sharing my background in Psychology. This experience opened my eyes to the need for social workers like me to help children like him.\n\nAnother value that drives me in social work is a commitment to social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuality, but often, we strive to conform to traditional norms. I'm proud to be an individual who refuses to be limited by what others expect of me. Throughout my high school and college years, I've actively protested against social injustice in my own way: expressing myself through fashion, speaking out against racism and discrimination, and advocating for the LGBTQ+ community through my involvement with GSBA. I believe in standing up for what's right and will continue to do so in my career as a social worker.\n\nI believe that my unique experiences, values, and commitment to social justice make me a strong candidate for a career in social work. I'm eager to make a difference in the lives of children and families in need, and I'm excited to start this journey.",
            "This paper explores the relationship between the Biological and Sociocultural models and insomnia, a complex sleep disorder. The biological model focuses on the genetic and medical factors that contribute to insomnia, while the Sociocultural model examines the environmental influences on sleep patterns, including demographics, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. This review examines the selected research studies related to these models, discusses their findings, and critiques their strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into three main groups: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders related to other mental health issues, or sleep disorders caused by medical complications or substance use. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias (difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep) and Parasomnias (behavioral or physiological sleep disorders). The Sociocultural models look at how environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status and ethnicity, impact sleep patterns.\n\nThe biological model focuses on the genetic and physiological aspects of sleep regulation. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that the activation of GABAA receptors on orexin neurons promotes sleep, while inhibition of these receptors can induce reduced anxiety and sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep time in mice, suggesting a potential genetic and environmental basis for sleep regulation in humans. This study has implications for understanding the biological basis of sleep disorders, including insomnia.\n\nFrom a Sociocultural perspective, if the phenotype of the GABAB receptor is inherited, it could regulate sleep patterns, and alterations to this receptor could naturally disrupt sleep. This could have significant impacts on daily life, including difficulties with concentration and focus. The Sociocultural model highlights the importance of considering environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status and ethnicity, in understanding insomnia.\n\nOverall, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Biological and Sociocultural models of insomnia, highlighting the complex interplay between genetic, physiological, and environmental factors that contribute to this complex sleep disorder.",
            "Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is a condition where the brain struggles to process and interpret auditory information. This doesn't mean that individuals with CAPD have a hearing problem or are unable to hear sounds. Instead, their brain's ability to distinguish between different sounds, identify patterns, and filter out background noise is impaired. As a result, people with CAPD may find it difficult to follow conversations, understand speech in noisy environments, or even make sense of auditory information they receive.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has been around for decades, dating back to the 1950s when researchers first described it as \"auditory imperception.\" Since then, studies have continued to evolve, with notable contributions from researchers such as Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, who developed tests for children with communicative disorders in the 1950s and 1960s. A national conference in 1977 helped stimulate research on CAPD in children, leading to a better understanding of the disorder.\n\nIndividuals with CAPD may exhibit a range of symptoms, including difficulty localizing sounds, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing patterns, and differentiating changes in speech. They may also struggle to filter out background noise, synthesize sound clues, and determine the sequence of auditory information. These challenges can impact daily life, making everyday tasks like following instructions or conversations more difficult.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive assessment, which may include observations of listening behavior, questionnaires, and standardized tests. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other specialists may use various measures to evaluate auditory-related skills. While there is no single test or tool that can diagnose CAPD with high accuracy, a combination of assessments can help identify the condition. These tests often present individuals with multiple auditory stimuli and ask them to differentiate between specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's response to these signals.",
            "The play Twelfth Night points out the risks of using deception as a means to achieve one's goals, particularly in a long-term sense. While disguise can be an effective tool for concealing one's true identity, it can ultimately lead to a loss of self if not abandoned. The problem with revealing a deception is that it can lead to feelings of alienation, as those who were deceived may struggle to reconcile their feelings and maintain relationships. This is especially true when it comes to deception in the form of gender role reversal, which raises questions about the motivations behind such actions. In Twelfth Night, Viola's decision to disguise herself as a man is driven by a desire for self-preservation. She feels the need to adopt a male persona in order to protect herself from potential harm, as evidenced by her statement: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\n\nThis deception, however, leads to Viola being disconnected from the women around her and creates a complicated web of relationships. Olivia, in particular, becomes infatuated with Viola in her disguise as Cesario, only to later shift her affections to Sebastian. This shift raises questions about Olivia's true feelings and whether they are genuine or a product of her societal expectations. The play may also suggest that deception can sometimes be a catalyst for revealing suppressed emotions, as seen in the relationships between Olivia, Orsino, and Viola/Cesario. Certain passages hint that these characters may have unexpressed desires that are brought to the surface by Viola's disguise. For instance, Olivia's ease in switching her affections from Cesario to Sebastian suggests that she may be more focused on social appearances than genuine emotional connections. Her eventual acceptance of Viola as her sister also implies that she may have been using her romantic feelings as a way to justify her societal expectations.",
            "When looking at the German colonial empire, it's clear that its approach to various territories was far from uniform. The brutal treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa is a stark example of this. However, it's essential to understand that the German colonial empire was a complex entity with diverse policies and ruling styles across its vast territories. Even education systems varied significantly from one colony to another.\n\nWhen the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found a well-educated and literate African population. In contrast, German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. But the situation in South West Africa, now known as Namibia, presented a stark contrast. Unlike in East Africa, where the government invested heavily in the education of local populations, in South West Africa, the task of educating the native population was largely left to missionary societies with limited government support. While the government invested in schools for Europeans and supported missionary schools, the majority of the African population remained uneducated and illiterate. This disparity had long-lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this divergence, and this paper aims to explore these factors in more detail. It will examine the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans and draw on new research to shed light on this complex issue.\n\nThe literature on education in the German colonial empire is extensive, with many studies focusing on specific colonies and systems. Early works, mainly written in German, aimed to describe the features of these educational systems. Later studies, written in English, provided more in-depth comparative analyses of education in the various German colonies. One notable study is Cohen's comparison of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which highlights the differences between the two colonies. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa played a significant role in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa's relatively temperate climate attracted a sizable European population. By 1913, over 15,000 whites lived in the colony, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population. These demographic differences had a profound impact on the educational systems of the two colonies, leading to the stark contrast between them.",
            "Heavy metal music has evolved significantly since its inception over 100 years ago, and the constant branching out into sub and sub-sub genres has made it challenging to define the entire realm of popular music. Many genres, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, have also spawned various sub-genres within their domains. One of the most expressive and diverse genres that has emerged over the past 40 years is Heavy Metal rock, which is characterized by its wide range of emotions, predominantly darker ones. This diversity is a result of its adaptability, allowing artists to create their own sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, which has led to a proliferation of niches and themes.\n\nIt's now difficult to pinpoint the exact definition of heavy metal, as it has incorporated elements from other genres and has branched out into numerous sub-niches. To truly understand the various types of metal music that exist today, it's essential to grasp the essence of the metal movement and its significance as a distinct entity.\n\nAt its core, heavy metal is a movement defined by its darker aspects, which can be seen as a \"music of more\" - more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. Metal musicians often possess impressive technical skills, which are evident in their music. The genre has also been heavily influenced by psychedelic drugs, particularly in the mid-70s, which led to the creation of crazy and otherworldly records. The movement has taken on many dark and visceral qualities, which were relatively new to the music scene at the time. Later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the darker aspects of the Romantic Era, resulting in lyrics that reflect the genre's darker side, such as those found in the song Helter Skelter by the Beatles.\n\nThese lyrics showcase the Beatles' exploration of the darker side, which some consider to be one of the first heavy metal songs. It was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker song, and the Beatles aimed to prove that they could match the Stones' intensity. This song was featured on The White Album, demonstrating its significance in the evolution of heavy metal music.",
            "Before the Surrealist movement took off, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own unique works, literally and figuratively. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is more than just a representation of a woman in awe of her surroundings - it's also a reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations and internal struggles as an artist. For years, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise from other artists and art lovers, but this goal came with a challenge: conform to the art world's expectations or forge his own path.\n\nTo understand The Dream, you need to know a bit about Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, he came from a family of modest means, with his father being a tinsmith and hardware dealer. Despite never receiving formal art training, Rousseau worked as a gabelou (municipal toll service employee) until age 40, earning the nickname douanier (customs inspector) along the way. After his wife Clémence's passing, which was followed by the loss of eight infant children, Rousseau was left with one child and a deep sense of grief. He turned to painting as a way to escape his sorrow and start anew.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized and sentimentalized the peasant experience in their artwork, Rousseau was a folk painter who drew from his own life and hopes. His desire for acceptance in the art world is understandable, given that he was self-taught and began his career at an older age, competing with talented and well-known modern artists like Matisse. As Jan Gordon notes in his book Modern French Painters, while Matisse feared painting trite works, Rousseau aimed to create conventional art that would earn him a spot among the Artiste Français.\n\nThe Dream is a testament to Rousseau's internal struggle to balance his desire for recognition with his need for creative independence. By examining his life and artistic journey, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities behind this iconic painting.",
            "Many thinkers have pondered the connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there's a fundamental reason for this relationship. As John Keats writes in his famous \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While our knowledge of life often stems from education or experience, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being formally taught these concepts. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than prescribe; they attempt to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nWhat's most noteworthy is that criticism of art or morals can't fully capture the essence of what's good or beautiful. When discussing the worth of a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa, we might focus on aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these elements don't truly convey why it's a great work of art. When asked about a favorite piece of art or literature, people often respond with phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a more in-depth analysis. I believe that both art and morals can't be reduced to a simple description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe the properties of a work of literature, there's still something intangible left. Ethics, much like art, possesses this transcendental quality, which provides a connection between the two.\n\nI propose that morality and art are closely linked because we experience both at a fundamental, noumenal level. They impact us in ways that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is particularly strong when it comes to literature, as it's an art form that inherently carries moral weight. As McKean noted, \"What distinguishes literature from other arts is its moral quality. While moral standards may not be relevant to other arts like music, they seem to be as applicable to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The modern Germany is a robust nation, boasting a unique cultural identity shaped by its history, from the sun-kissed Alps in Munich to the Baltic coast in Kiel. A similar cultural thread runs through the Rhine River city of Cologne, through the heart of Germany to the picturesque city of Dresden on the Elbe River. Given this rich cultural tapestry, it's no surprise that Germany's present identity is the result of a diverse blend of influences from various tribes and cultures.\n\nThe origins of the name \"Germany\" are shrouded in mystery, with scholars and historians debating its etymology. According to historical accounts, the name may have originated from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gauls. The Roman historian Tacitus, writing in the 1st century AD, attributed the name to this tribe. Conversely, Julius Caesar claimed to have borrowed the term \"Germanus\" from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes they had yet to defeat. While the true origin of the name remains uncertain, some propose that it refers to the Gaulish word for \"neighbor\" or perhaps the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" highlighting the Germans' reputation for being loud and boisterous.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote extensively on the origins of the Germans in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum.\" He described the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by immigration or external influences, and noted that the harsh climate, unforgiving terrain, and rugged culture of Germany would be an unlikely destination for outsiders. The Romans, despite their conquests, rarely settled in Germany, preferring to trade with the Germanic tribes and recruit them into their military ranks rather than establishing a permanent presence.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged in the 1st century AD, they inhabited the fringes of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and skills with the Romans. Their interactions with the empire laid the groundwork for the complex cultural identity that defines modern Germany, a nation born from the confluence of diverse influences and experiences.",
            "As I stood there, my mind went blank, and I stared at the unremarkable scene in front of me. My thoughts drifted in and out of my consciousness like wisps of smoke, never quite landing or sticking. It was a sensation I'd grown accustomed to, a practiced numbness that allowed me to observe without truly engaging. The image before me was a jumbled mess of details, and yet, it was as if I had no thoughts of my own, just a smooth, liquid experience of the present moment.\n\nI'd always wanted to learn how to draw, ever since I was a child. So, on the advice of an artist I'd worked with, I picked up a copy of The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. The book promised to teach me the fundamental principles of art, from understanding the basics of a pencil to the mental processes that govern our perception of lines. One technique stuck with me – framing a picture with a simple square, breaking down a complex scene into a manageable form.\n\nAt that moment, however, I was too overwhelmed to apply that technique. The scene before me was too rich, too detailed, and I felt like I was drinking from a firehose. I was a blank slate, staring at the unremarkable bowl of brown matter in front of me, trying to make sense of it all. It was as if I was standing at the beginning of a journey, the start of my own artistic journey, and I felt the weight of that responsibility.\n\nMy hand, however, was eager to create. My fingers flexed, and my hand hovered over the toilet handle, poised to take action. But instead of drawing or painting, I ended up smacking the handle again, trying to dislodge the stubborn, brown package that refused to budge. I stood there, fuming, my green tie feeling like a noose around my neck. I was a janitor at Rite Aid, and it seemed like no one appreciated the art I brought to my work – the delicate dance of soap and water, the soothing sound of a toilet flushing.\n\nAs I stood there, one last time, I gripped the toilet paper roll, my hand molding itself into a makeshift mitt. Then, with a deep breath, I reached in, my hand dipping slowly into the bowl like a mother carefully placing a turkey in the oven. It was a mundane task, but in that moment, it felt like a work of art, a moment of creative expression in an otherwise dull, ordinary life.",
            "Each year, a disturbing number of teenagers lose their lives on the roads.  Several factors contribute to this alarming trend.  The National Institutes of Health point out that the teen brain simply isn't yet equipped to handle the dangers of driving.  Additionally, the lack of driving experience is a major contributor to the problem.  This inexperience not only results in a higher rate of fatal accidents, but also an increased likelihood of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeens also tend to fare poorly when driving with their peers, a fact that's hardly surprising given how often they do it.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a clear correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents that occur.  In an effort to improve teen safety, some states have implemented provisional driver's licenses that limit the hours teens can drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\nHowever, I believe that provisional licenses are merely a temporary fix.  The real issue is that, as a group, young drivers are simply not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.  According to psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license.  His research suggests that those under the age of 19 or 20 often have a strong desire to take risks for the thrill of it.  It makes sense, then, to delay driving until this tendency has begun to subside.  If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, we can expect to see even more deadly accidents and a staggering death toll in the years to come.  By 2010, the Baby Boomers' children will be eligible to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will be hitting the road.\n\nLegislation addressing this issue would be relatively straightforward.  Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full license, and a set number of practical driver's training hours would still be required.  The specific number of hours could be based on the requirements of the majority of states, such as the 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult currently required in California.  Uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country.  This idea is certainly not new.",
            "While browsing through the vast collection of early Edison films at the Library of Congress, I decided to take a closer look at the 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films often employ creative editing techniques to create illusions that captivate the viewer. My film analysis focused primarily on dissecting the poetics behind the majority of trick films and examining the unique characteristics present in a few of the later films that dared to break the mold. For the most part, trick films from the turn of the century are confined to a set-bound format, adhering to a strict one shot = one film methodology, featuring stationary cameras, long shots, and medium shots.\n\nHowever, a few films from the early 20th century began to challenge these conventions by introducing innovative elements such as multiple shots. One of the most notable similarities among trick films is their use of an interior set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary, never moving to follow figures or objects. This composition drew inspiration from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations of this style is that figures in trick films tend to move side-to-side, rather than towards or away from the camera. For instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, never venturing beyond the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also results in a predominantly use of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-up shots are notably absent in all the trick films from the Edison catalog. This convention is a nod to the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would witness the entire performance at any given time, framed within the borders of the stage. In early films, actors rarely move from the middle ground towards the camera, making close-ups a rarity.\n\nMost early trick films follow the pattern where one conceptual shot equals one film, limiting their length to approximately a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. This restriction also constrains the narrative or dramatic usage of trick films, which typically focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and switching antics with minimal storylines. Interestingly, however, a single \"shot\" in a trick film can actually comprise several joined shots to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong advocate for Republicanism, driven by his passion for agriculture and his brief stint in politics. As a result, he developed a reputation for being fiercely dedicated and outspoken on matters of personal freedom and government. His commitment to an agrarian-based system influenced his views on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system. He believed that preserving and promoting this ideal form of work was crucial in shaping his opinions on governance.\n\nIn Taylor's opinion, the United States had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system of self-government, unencumbered by native traditions. He firmly believed in the natural rights of individuals, which he argued were interconnected, and that denying one right would compromise the value of the remaining rights. Consequently, he believed that these rights should be beyond the reach of the government. He saw the concept of the \"state of nature\" as a reality where the strong and cunning profited, but in a civilized society, this was not acceptable.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be designed to account for the inherent good and evil within humanity. He was resolute in his dualistic morality, stating that as government is exercised by humans, it will reflect both virtues and vices. He defined good principles as those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism, which he believed would lead to a government that functioned equitably, regardless of its administration. However, self-interest, which he saw as a fundamental human motivation, was only considered evil when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.\n\nTaylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, seeking an extremely limited Federal government with no more rights or powers than those explicitly stated in the document. He recognized that an extensive Federal government would be expensive and potentially tyrannical. However, he also believed that a simple, literal interpretation was inadequate, as it could lead to corruption without considering the intent of the founders. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking at the data shown in Figure 17, it's clear that there was a significant drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. At first glance, this was a bit of a letdown, and it's tough to pinpoint the reason behind it. With the onset of winter on a New England campus, it's likely that the decrease in bike and foot traffic played a part in the decline. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a time when students are busy wrapping up schoolwork and dealing with final exams, which might have caused the commuter log to fall off many people's radar. The holiday season also kicked in during this time, followed by a month-long break for students and faculty, which probably contributed to the low numbers. Even when classes resumed in late January, submissions remained low, raising the question of whether this was a temporary lull or a sign of a more permanent drop in engagement. One possibility is that any project of this nature tends to have an initial surge of enthusiasm, followed by a gradual decline. To combat this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign aimed at reviving the initiative, which successfully resulted in an uptick in log submissions for that month. However, this still left us wondering how to maintain momentum in the face of the inevitable dip in engagement that occurs when students and faculty are on break. \n\nAnother challenge that came up during this project (and one that's likely to arise in any alternative commuting initiative) is the fact that driving a car gives people a sense of freedom and independence that's deeply ingrained in our culture. To overcome this, we offered incentives in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, and other establishments. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes, such as a new bike or a hybrid/electric car, might have impacted participation. Perhaps if we had announced these larger prizes in December and January, that might have helped to mitigate the dip in engagement that we experienced. The value of the prizes didn't change over the course of the project, but if we had upped the ante, it's possible that participation would have remained strong rather than dipping.",
            "In the world of investing, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have gained popularity due to their unique combination of characteristics - flexibility, diversification, and low expense ratios. An ETF is essentially a security that tracks an index, commodity, or a basket of assets, similar to an index fund, but trades on an exchange like a stock. This enables investors to reap the benefits of single stock ownership, such as short-selling, buying on margin, and purchasing as few as one share in a transaction. Furthermore, ETFs offer a wider variety of funds to choose from, making it easier for investors to find the right fit for their investment goals.\n\nHowever, as with any investment, there are some downsides to consider. For instance, ETFs come with a commission on trades, similar to buying or selling stocks. Despite these minor drawbacks, the benefits of ETFs are undeniable. In this analysis, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning a single ETF is equivalent to a diversified portfolio of the individual stocks. We will also investigate whether a reconfigured portfolio of the same stocks could provide a better return and lower beta.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below is a list of the top 10 holdings and their corresponding percentage of total assets.\n\nTo gauge the effectiveness of these 10 stocks in representing the ETF as a whole, we will calculate their contributions to a portfolio's beta and return if the portfolio were made up entirely of these stocks in the proportions determined by the ETF's holdings. The calculations are included in the chart below.\n\nThe chart clearly shows that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF. Based on these results, it appears that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta. Nevertheless, it's essential to verify whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo determine this, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "It's interesting to note that Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" one of his standout poems. In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, which is a reference to a mysterious island located north of Britain, viewed by the Greeks as the edge of the world. However, Virgil is not the only source for this term, as some scholars suggest that Poe may have been influenced by German literature. Poe was indeed a fan of German authors, including Goethe. \n\nIn fact, a closer look at Goethe's work \"Faust\" reveals a poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king who is heartbroken after his wife's passing, and he turns to excessive drinking. The poem's themes of loss and despair are eerily similar to those found in \"Dream-Land.\" It's possible that Poe was paying homage to Goethe's work, as scholar Karl J. Arndt notes in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon.\" Furthermore, Goethe's \"Faust\" was a celebrated work of poetic drama, published in two parts in 1808 and 1832, respectively. The parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are striking, with both works exploring themes of loss, grief, and the human condition.\n\nPoe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in his collected writings is notable, with references in both \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land.\" The two poems can be seen as companion pieces, with \"The King of Thulé\" serving as a dark reflection of the themes found in \"Dream-Land.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape, haunted by the memories of loved ones, while in \"The King of Thulé,\" Goethe's king is similarly consumed by grief after the loss of his wife.\n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Tennyson and his familiarity with German literature, it's likely that he would have been aware of Goethe's work. In fact, Poe's respect for Tennyson suggests that he would have been exposed to Goethe's writings through various reproductions and translations that were popular at the time.",
            "In a recent court case, a woman named Jennifer Palmer is suing D&D Markets for punitive damages after she slipped and fell on an applesauce spill at the store. The store manager, Paul Martin, was informed about the spill not once, but twice, and chose to ignore it for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner. The question is whether Martin's actions were malicious enough to warrant punitive damages under California law. \n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Palmer's claim outright. To win punitive damages, she'll need to show that Martin's actions were done with a reckless disregard for the harm they would cause. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known about the dangers of leaving a spill unattended, given that several customers had slipped and fallen due to similar incidents at the store in the past. However, it's less clear whether Martin's actions were truly malicious, given that he had been warned twice about the spill. Still, Palmer has a strong argument that Martin failed to act with the necessary care to ensure customer safety, especially given the six slip-and-fall incidents at the store in 2009.\n\nAccording to court records, on October 13, 2009, two employees, Rich Wayne and Mary J. Haddigan, separately informed Martin about the applesauce spill, but he dismissed their concerns, saying he was busy eating dinner. Thirty minutes later, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, severely injuring her back. Prior to her accident, five other customers had reported slipping and falling at the store that year.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The law defines malice as conduct that was intended to cause harm or was done with a \"despicable\" disregard for others' safety. The court has ruled that conduct is malicious when the defendant is aware of the likely harm their actions will cause and deliberately chooses to ignore it. In this case, Palmer may have a strong case for punitive damages, but it will ultimately depend on how the court interprets Martin's actions and intentions.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took an Islam course at CBC, and one topic continues to fascinate me to this day: whether Islam is inherently a hostile religion. In my opinion, this question is more relevant now than ever, especially considering the shift in media portrayals of Islam and its adherents since 9/11. It's intriguing to think about the possibility of a presidential candidate with a strong Muslim background, like Barack Obama, running for office in 2001. \n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has always piqued my interest. The more I learn about Muhammad's life, the more I'm struck by the contrast between the historical figure and the depiction in his biography. I previously believed that Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing his religion on them. However, the biography presents a different narrative – one of a humble and self-effacing figure who was misunderstood and humbled himself to others. It was only after people witnessed his teachings that they came to see the truth in them. \n\nWhat's even more striking is the similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. For instance, the story of multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men is a notable example. The way this story is told makes me think that the authors wanted Muhammad to be seen as a prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and performed miracles. This approach, however, undermines the significance of Jesus' life and teachings. It's as if they're attempting to steal and co-opt the essence of Jesus' message through Muhammad. \n\nAnother aspect of the biography that raises questions is the way it presents stories of people converting to Islam. While the authors aim to demonstrate the truth of these stories, the fact that they're often based on second-hand accounts from multiple people makes me skeptical. I think this approach diminishes the impact of the stories and makes them seem suspicious. \n\nWhat bothers me most is the way the biography portrays Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man. However, historical accounts contradict this image, and I'm left wondering if modern Muslims are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The core teachings of Jesus and the original beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly abandoned as Christianity evolved after his passing.  If we look at this historical trend in broad strokes, it appears that Christianity has been moving further and further away from its roots over time.  However, there is an increasing awareness and a progressive movement in today's world that could potentially alter this trajectory.  While traditionalists may resist any ideas that diverge from their established beliefs, they might not be influential enough to dictate the future of the faith.  As time progresses, Christians will increasingly become aware of the history of their faith and crave a closer understanding of the original intentions of Jesus' teachings.  It may take several decades or even centuries, but it's inevitable that we will see a major shift in the course of Christian history, resulting in a return to the faith's original form.  A movement will emerge that will systematically peel away the layers of doctrine that have been added over time, effectively reversing the clock and returning to the core principles that Jesus introduced to humanity in the name of God.  When this trend gains momentum in the United States and Europe, it will spread across the masses, prompting a return to the simplicity of following Jesus' ideas as they were intended, rather than the complex interpretations that have developed over time.  The church will continue to serve as a guiding institution, but its influence will be characterized by a growing uniformity of belief and practice.  Rather than differences between regions, denominations, and divisions, we can expect to see increasing similarities.  History has shown us that great reversals can occur, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution.  Similarly, our nation has progressed from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The impending reversal in the Christian faith will be a significant event that will undo the accumulated complexities of history and seek out the faith's original source, resulting in a unification of the diverse branches of Christianity.  A crucial factor in making this process possible will be the shift from interpreting Jesus' words as literal statements to understanding them as metaphors.  So what led to the transformation of Christianity over time?\n\nLooking back into history, we find that the seeds of the Christian faith were planted in Judaism, the theological foundation of the Christian religion.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the core elements of monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were already in place.  However, the Jewish population was not a unified entity, with various groups, such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people, each with their own distinct spirit and perspective.",
            "I firmly believe that The Jungle portrays the darker aspects of human nature, exposing people's inherent selfishness and self-centeredness. Deep down, many individuals are primarily concerned with their own well-being and success, often disregarding the needs and welfare of those around them. The novel masterfully illustrates this concept through the actions of the factory owners and managers. Their sole focus is on expanding their businesses and increasing their wealth, without any regard for the consequences or harm caused to others. As Upton Sinclair so vividly describes, the factory's towering structures and smoke-belching chimneys symbolize the devastating impact of their greed. The pollution and unsanitary conditions surrounding Packingtown are a stark reminder of the owners' disregard for human and animal life.\n\nMoreover, the owners and managers showed a blatant disregard for their employees, whom they exploited for their own gain. They would stop at nothing to save a buck, even if it meant subjecting their workers to inhumane conditions and long working hours. The novel starkly highlights the lack of empathy and decency in the workplace, where a worker's value was measured solely by their productivity, not their human worth. The absence of labor regulations and worker protections during that era allowed the factory owners to operate with impunity, forcing their employees to endure grueling conditions and live in squalor. Although the novel doesn't explicitly state it, the workers who toiled and suffered in Packingtown were essentially treated like slaves, with no access to resources, information, or support. Even the unions that formed to protect workers often ended up taking advantage of them, further exacerbating their struggles.\n\nThe novel paints a grim picture of a system where workers were trapped, with no escape from the cruel and unforgiving world of Packingtown. As Sinclair so eloquently puts it, the consequences of this system were as inevitable and widespread as those under chattel slavery.",
            "When authors write novels, they often use various techniques to evoke certain feelings or attitudes from their readers. These techniques can be quite effective, and F. Scott Fitzgerald is no exception. In his iconic novel The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald employs several of these techniques to shape the reader's perception of key subjects. One of these techniques is pairing an adjective and a noun in a way that doesn't typically mesh, to create an unexpected aura around the subject. Another technique is assigning meaning to a symbol, only to reuse it for the same purpose later on. Fitzgerald frequently uses the latter technique with colors, including gold, green, white, and various shades of pink and red. In The Great Gatsby, he gradually builds up connotations for certain colors, particularly white and gray, before utilizing them to convey a specific emotion or feeling associated with a pivotal object.\n\nFitzgerald develops the meaning of white and gray in the beginning of the novel, implying uniformity and a sense of sameness. White is portrayed as somewhat upscale and refined, while gray is depicted as more aged and faded. He initially establishes this meaning by consistently using these colors throughout the novel. For example, Daisy and Jordan are often seen wearing white, and even other characters like Nick wear white attire to Gatsby's parties. However, when Nick describes the party, he notes the use of \"primary colors,\" which stands out from the predominantly white-and-gray aesthetic. Fitzgerald further reinforces this meaning by using these colors to describe mundane, unremarkable subjects, such as Nick's commute to work or the apartment buildings in the city. He also applies these colors to ordinary people or places, like Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood\" or the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes.\n\nAfter establishing the meaning of white and gray, Fitzgerald uses them to signify a lack of importance or uniformity in various subjects, starting with Daisy. After a period of relative scarcity of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as dressed in white in a \"little white roadster,\" giving readers the impression that she is not a fully fleshed-out character, but rather a uniform, something that Gatsby desires but cannot attain. Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly to give the impression of Daisy as a more uniform, unremarkable figure, such as when he describes a \"gray haze\" around her fur collar or her wearing a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County boasts an incredibly productive agricultural sector, thanks to its pleasant, sunny climate. The region grows a wide variety of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. Interestingly, there's a significant demand for locally produced, organic community-supported agriculture food in the area, with numerous organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many of these farms offer tours of their agricultural operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. By adopting organic farming practices, landowners can benefit from government programs while also protecting and enhancing local habitats, thus allowing for recreational use and educational opportunities.\n\nWhile organic farming offers many benefits, including greater biodiversity due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water, it often comes with higher costs. Organic farming requires more labor and management to control pests and weeds, fertilize the soil without chemicals, and mitigate losses, which can be greater than those experienced with conventional methods. Additionally, small organic farms are often less efficient than larger operations and may face higher labor costs for practices that benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species control, and managing plant growth to create specific conditions like edge habitats or open patches of ground.\n\nThe proposed land for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land features a mix of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered or declining. These species include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The parcel was part of an original homestead patent, suggesting it was used for grazing and/or wood production for many years.\n\nI selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched government programs to determine the options available to a small farmer seeking to mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what someone farming this land might attempt to achieve, I drew inspiration from an organic farm in the same area.",
            "In any negotiation, understanding the role of culture is vital. However, culture is not a fixed entity that can be easily defined or stereotyped. It's more often a complex tapestry of nuances, where what culture is not can be just as telling as what it actually is. Broad statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify the richness of a culture. Instead, a negotiator should focus on grasping the significance of a culture in the context of the negotiation, and how it will impact the discussion at hand.\n\nWhen engaging with a foreign culture, we inevitably draw parallels to our own, often leading to misunderstandings. To navigate these differences, one must not only study a culture's history and prejudices but also be willing to accept it for what it is, rather than judging or trying to change it. This acceptance is especially crucial when dealing with a weaker bargaining position or negotiating in a foreign territory. Demonstrating respect for a culture's traditions and beliefs can be a powerful tool in bridging cultural divides and moving the negotiation forward.\n\nCulture is not limited to national or international boundaries. Companies within a nation often develop their own unique corporate culture, characterized by distinct values, communication styles, and hiring practices. For instance, some companies prioritize long work hours, while others encourage a more relaxed schedule. Employee dress codes, communication styles, and philanthropic efforts can all reveal the underlying corporate culture. Even within the same nation, different companies and regions can exhibit vastly different corporate cultures.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's values is equally crucial, as they provide the underlying motivations and driving forces. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior. On the other hand, a culture that places a high value on a hard-driven bargain may not be inclined to settle quickly. By considering these cultural nuances before the negotiation, a negotiator can gain a crucial edge. However, it's equally important to learn about the personal dynamics of the opposing party, as this can be the key to a successful negotiation.",
            "It's often said, \"There is no God,\" but this phrase is something that both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas strongly disagree with, as seen in their respective writings on the existence of God. Both of these thinkers present arguments in defense of the same concept of God, so in order to compare their theories, we'll assume they're correct in their belief in the God of the Bible. After all, comparing their arguments to a God figure that doesn't resemble the one they're defending wouldn't allow for a fair comparison.\n\nWhen looking at their arguments, it's clear that neither of them provides a complete basis for believing in God. One of the main issues with their arguments is that they both miss the bigger picture. I think this point can be best understood by examining the basic arguments of each author in more detail.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument is based on the idea that we can find proof of God's existence within our own minds. He suggests that because we can't effectively conceive God's nonexistence, it's clear that he exists. While this idea may be a bit confusing at times, the basic gist is that the proof for God lies within our own understanding. This idea is often referred to as faith within Christian texts, and it's based on the idea that we don't need external evidence to prove the existence of God - just our own knowledge.\n\nOn the other hand, St. Thomas Aquinas has a very different approach. He believes that we can prove God's existence using reason and empirical evidence alone, with no need for faith. This idea would be useful in spreading the message of Christianity because it would allow new converts to be convinced through logic rather than faith. Aquinas presents five different logical arguments to support the existence of God, which include change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Essentially, he argues that the existence of God is a logical necessity - if you're missing one puzzle piece, you can still understand its features and existence without actually seeing it.",
            "In the early days of recorded history, a prince was born, who would one day be known as the Buddha. As time passed, he abandoned his royal life and embarked on a spiritual journey that led to his enlightenment. His teachings eventually gave rise to Buddhism, with the Theravada sect being one of its most traditional forms. This ancient faith is over 2,500 years old, and it's undergone significant changes since the Buddha's time. For instance, in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, the annual water-cutting ceremony is an event that's deeply rooted in tradition, although the Buddha never mentioned it. This illustrates the extent to which the religion has evolved over time, from its superficial customs to its fundamental principles. As a result, the Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its doctrine in response to both internal and external influences, some of which have been hostile and others benevolent.\n\nThroughout this discussion, we'll be using certain key terms. An internal force is defined as a factor that arises from within the Buddhist community, regardless of whether its members are monks or laypeople. In contrast, an external force refers to any influence from outside the Buddhist community. A hostile force is any force that harms or seeks to damage the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of the faith. On the other hand, a benign force is one that doesn't aim to harm or help the community, but may inadvertently have either effect.\n\nTo begin with, it's essential to understand the core principles of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, which is comprised of three baskets of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka provides the metaphysical framework of Buddhism. This framework includes concepts such as Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of everything). Only by recognizing these concepts can one break free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which continues endlessly. Along with Sansara, one's attachment to lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) will also cease when one becomes enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for laymen and monks alike, with five precepts for laymen (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances) and a more detailed set of disciplinary rules for monks. The most fundamental concept in Buddhism is the four noble truths: Dukkha, the truth that life is suffering; the attachment that causes suffering; the possibility of overcoming suffering; and the path to achieve that liberation.",
            "The rivalry between the United States and Mexico is a prime example of a longstanding feud that spanned an impressive 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The peak of this animosity was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the U.S. gained the upper hand and claimed Texas and the Southwest as its own territory. The tension between the two nations was fueled by numerous clashes, which eventually subsided just before the outbreak of World War I. The initial spark of this rivalry emerged from fundamental differences in their values, customs, and faith, along with significant disparities in their material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). \n\nThis type of long-standing rivalry is not unique to the U.S. and Mexico; many nations bordering their neighbors often develop opposing interests, contributing to the formation of deep-seated rivalries. The U.S. and Mexico are not alone in their historical tensions with their neighboring countries; David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that Mexico and Cuba are the only two nations that have consistently posed significant diplomatic problems for the U.S. (p. 41). Both of these countries are geographically close to the U.S. and have historically vied for its attention, whereas many other Latin American nations have maintained more positive relationships with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in the rift between the two nations, a common thread in the history of various international conflicts. Sally Frahm (2001) points out that, \"if Americans opposed fascism and communism in the 20th century, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries\" (p. 86). In a similar vein, the ideological struggle between the U.S. and the Soviet Union during the Cold War was, in part, a clash over core values and vital interests. In the case of the U.S. and Mexico, however, the underlying conflict was rooted in their differing religious preferences, inherited from their colonial past. This inherent distrust was a major obstacle to establishing friendly diplomatic relations between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during the 57-year rivalry period. The majority of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems. The problem of bandits and outlaws from American border towns further exacerbated tensions until both nations deployed military force along their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nThe rivalry between the two nations began to subside as \"Mexico became increasingly reliant on the United States\" (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109) and eventually ended as U.S. ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, my life took an unexpected turn when I suddenly fell ill with an illness I was previously unaware of. At the time, I was working as a nurse, a profession I had chosen for the stability and security it offered, especially given my tumultuous childhood. The constant reassurance was that \"you'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" Thus, even though my true aspirations lay in science and journalism, I pursued nursing. \n\nHowever, fate had other plans. At 46, I was left with little savings, unable to work, and facing a future shrouded in uncertainty. Fifteen years of living off social security disability have left me with nothing to call my own. Each day is a struggle, a constant battle for security, safety, and self-esteem. Yet, amidst the chaos, one truth remains: I couldn't have navigated these difficult years without the unwavering support of my family and a handful of loyal friends. In times of true crisis, one's strength is often an illusion. \n\nMy point is that life is unpredictable, and emergencies can strike at any moment, big or small. No matter how well-prepared one is, some challenges are too great to overcome alone. \n\nWhile I agree that the US needs to rethink its reliance on a faltering government, I firmly believe that a more effective solution lies in fostering a culture of mutual support and help among Americans. Rather than relying solely on the government, we should encourage people to trust and rely on one another. This approach would be a more effective safeguard against life's uncertainties. \n\nThe notion of rugged individualism, often touted by American conservatives, is often romanticized. However, the true secret to the success of our forefathers was not their isolation but their compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast alone; they relied on each other for survival. \n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I have my own disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and other essentials. If you have the means, consider starting a small farm or acquiring a wood stove. But while you're at it, take the time to get to know your neighbors. Building a community that looks out for one another is the most effective way to navigate life's uncertainties.",
            "Evolutionary changes in organisms have long been a subject of interest and debate among scientists. One question that has puzzled researchers for years is what drives the direction of evolutionary change. It's surprising that even today, despite the significant progress made in understanding organic forms, defining them in mathematical terms remains a daunting task. However, recent studies have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk development, both during their growth and throughout their evolutionary history (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our current research aims to explore how mathematical modeling, combined with experimental studies, can help explain the mechanisms behind the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum. \n\nTo achieve this, we employed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify key parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were then input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). By using these parameters, we created hypothetical shell morphologies that can help us understand the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. The results of our study are being integrated with experimental and descriptive research to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nConsidering a shell as a tube that moves through 360 degrees of space over time, we can break it down into distinct components. The revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis, known as the columella, runs through the central column of the shell. The speed at which the whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line separating each whorl is called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all the whorls except the last, while the apex is the tip of the spire and the base is the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nStudying shells involves examining them from various angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. Typically, shells are viewed from an apertural perspective, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first viewing the shell from the apical perspective and determining where the first suture begins. By drawing a line to divide the shell into two parts, we can then count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl. \n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal grows its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture, we can use coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented, allowing us to formulate a mathematical model of the mollusk's skeletogenesis. Once we have a mathematical formulation, we can then vary parameters to modify the mollusk's development.",
            "For the past decade, Indonesia has seen little progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality rates.  Despite making significant strides in achieving Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the country still lags behind in improving child and maternal health indicators.  To understand the reasons behind these shortcomings, it's essential to examine the health system's weaknesses, rather than focusing solely on program-specific interventions.\n\nOne area of improvement has been the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this target.  However, this statistic includes traditional workers like midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complicated pregnancies and, as a result, contribute to high maternal mortality rates due to hemorrhage.  This achievement is somewhat misleading, highlighting the need for further action.  Furthermore, there's been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a healthcare professional.  Data on postnatal care is incomplete, but it's clear that this area is a concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nThe cesarean-section rate in Indonesia remains unacceptably low at around 4%.  This rate is even more concerning when considering the significant disparity between urban and rural areas, with a 5% difference between the two.  This disparity is a clear indication of unequal access to healthcare services, with a focus on urban areas.  Another issue is the lack of vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  It's clear that the poor face significant challenges in accessing healthcare services, largely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to effectively address the lack of service.  Should Indonesia focus on developing program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system, prioritizing the well-being of mothers and children before and after pregnancy?  While programmatic approaches may seem appealing due to their targeted objectives and potential for faster results, there are significant drawbacks to consider.  One major concern is that investing heavily in one area can lead to a lack of funding and resources for other critical areas, causing a brain drain of skilled healthcare workers.  Additionally, running multiple parallel programs for the same area can result in duplication of services, increased paperwork, and inefficiencies.",
            "Victorian novels are often associated with their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the time period.  However, two novels that stand out from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both of these novels incorporate elements of mystery and a touch of the bizarre, which deviates from the typical characteristics of the era.  This unique approach enhances the characters within each work, offering a deeper look into their thoughts and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist delves into the darker side of the period, the author skillfully weaves together a complex web of thoughts and events.  The main character's mind is flooded with jumbled ideas, making it difficult for him to distinguish reality from fantasy.  In one particular instance, Oliver finds himself walking between Sikes and Crackit, who are engaged in a heated argument.  The words they speak seem to echo in his mind, and when he regains his composure, he realizes that he's having a conversation with them.  Suddenly, the sound of gunfire shatters the atmosphere, and Oliver is swept away by an unseen force.  Throughout this chaotic scene, Oliver experiences a nagging sense of pain, which haunts him relentlessly.\n\nBoth novels use dream sequences or dreamlike states to convey this sense of mystery, although the content and purpose vary between the two.  Oliver Twist often employs these strange occurrences to reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, his deep-seated fears, and his perception of the world around him.  When Oliver relives the shooting scene in chapter 28, he does so in a state of vivid imagination, as if it's a recurring nightmare.  This passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the events that unfold, as well as the dire state of his health, which is reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit.  The shooting overwhelms Oliver, numbing his senses as he's whisked away by an unseen force.  He's forced to relive his despair, his pain now constant and linked to fear rather than surprise.  This scene raises questions about whose will led to his misfortune, as it was certainly not his own.  Oliver's growing sense of defeat is also implied, as if Fagin's influence has broken him, forcing him to accept this despair and rendering him unable to react.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the author similarly employs dreamlike states to convey the turmoil and mystery of the characters.  The passage describes the passage of time as a perpetual state of limbo, with days blurring together and nights feeling both long and fleeting.  This sense of timelessness reflects the characters' own emotional states, which are characterized by a sense of desperation and longing.",
            "A couple of years ago, I worked at an after-school program where I tutored elementary age students in various subjects. My strengths were in English and reading, and I was assigned to help a boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. As I worked with him, I realized that something was amiss - he had an unusual problem with reading. Some letters he could pronounce perfectly, while others were way off. It was quite peculiar. Adrian's parents were of Latino descent, but he spoke perfect English, which only added to the confusion. We made little progress until I met his mother, who only spoke Spanish. With my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read just fine, but he just didn't know the English alphabet well. I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the problem of the language barrier in schools, particularly in California. It's not always as obvious as we think, and even a child who speaks perfect English can still struggle with reading. Everyone agrees that this problem exists, so what's the solution? In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading, especially the alphabet and pronunciations, was relatively straightforward. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these alone will fix the problem. The key lies in combining them all.\n\nThe dual language system is an excellent idea, not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Studies have shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many fear that this approach is a waste of resources, but that's a misconception. If we were to implement these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all children would benefit from them. So, how do we do it? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic. Instead, we could have special aids, tutors, or whatever you call them, who are bilingual.",
            "For most of us, the concept of something greater than ourselves has been instilled in us since childhood. We've been taught about it in Sunday school, at Temple, or in our own introspection. Some of us accept the faith passed down to us from our parents, while others reject it entirely, believing that there's no truth beyond our own personal perspectives. We might switch between different value systems, searching for a guiding light in the darkness. This search for meaning helps us define ourselves and find our own unique sense of spirituality.\n\nI recall a conversation with my dad, where he revealed his favorite type of bird – the cardinal.  We sat on our porch, listening to the rain, the smell of our cigarettes lingering in the air. The sound of the rainwater rushing through the gutters and drowning the nearby plants created a melancholic atmosphere. My dad's appearance had changed in recent months; he'd lost weight, and his hair had thinned out. He stared into the rain, lost in thought, avoiding eye contact. I felt a mix of emotions – loneliness, fear, and the inability to talk to him about his impending passing. I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in gazing out into the rain, trying to cherish the moment.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his life, but not alleviated his suffering. I couldn't understand the purpose of prolonging his suffering. I stopped praying, wondering if God had stopped listening to me long ago. If there was a God, I thought, he must have stopped caring about me.\n\nI didn't want to witness my father's final moments, so I chose not to be there. I wanted to remember him for the life he lived, not the way he died. I knew my dad better than anyone, and I believed he wouldn't have wanted me to be a spectator to his passing. I spent three days curled up in bed, waiting for the news. But no one even bothered to call me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is an intriguing oxymoron that encapsulates the essence of something both old and new.  As Ian Watt so eloquently puts it, \"Gothic Novel\" is, in essence, 'Old-New.' The Gothic mode has been met with both praise and criticism, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others admiring its ability to evoke the 'terrible sublime' (Burke).  In creating the first \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto skillfully blended elements of both the old and modern romance genres, forging a new literary path. Walpole cleverly combined ancient theatrical elements and modern novelistic mimicry to craft a story he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). This novel drew heavily from medieval theatrical traditions, architecture, and customs, which were seen as outdated and unsophisticated in comparison to the modern world. The fusion of these elements with the novel's format, which allowed readers a more personal glimpse into the characters' psychology, is what has allowed the Gothic genre to endure and maintain its relevance across time, becoming both obsolete and new to readers from different eras.\n\nOne of the central themes in Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry, which originated in the medieval era. The original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, retains and reinterprets this concept, elevating it to an idealized state. Chivalry represented the epitome of the noble knight: brave, honorable, and competent. Gothic writers, including Walpole, were drawn to this ideal and saw it as a benchmark for the present society, which they perceived as lacking. By employing chivalric concepts and mannerisms, the \"gothic past\" was romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic to Romanticism. This is exemplified in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, including being a prince, having suffered through tragedy, and being mistakenly believed to have been killed by infidels. Frederic's description is replete with traditional chivalric imagery, which is later exaggerated, introducing the trope of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the intricate process of moving goods from the initial customer order to the final stage of distribution, encompassing the raw materials, production, and delivery to the customer. This concept was first coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant who described the entire process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to satisfy customers' needs in a timely and efficient manner. At the heart of supply chain management are six fundamental elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. By mastering these elements, business managers can provide top-notch customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundation upon which the entire supply chain process is built. It involves determining the when, why, where, and how of production, including understanding customer demands. To grasp customer needs, managers examine market trends, which serve as the largest indicator of customer demands. Once market analysis is complete, managers decide what products to produce, in what quantities, and where to produce them, taking into account customer satisfaction and demand. Scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment are also crucial tasks at this stage. As I've witnessed firsthand in my past experience working at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores, having a well-defined process and layout is essential for smooth operations and prevents confusion and misdirection.\n\nSupply, the second key element, involves making strategic decisions about the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its unique equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must choose the most suitable division for each process or decide to outsource work to other companies to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. By streamlining operations through outsourcing, companies can reduce costs and maintain a competitive edge.",
            "I recently came across a disturbing message scrawled on a street corner in Burma, a country ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a violent coup. The sign held by Ellen Page, star of the critically acclaimed film Juno, reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma\", a haunting reference to the country's history of oppression and human rights abuses. Burma, also known as Myanmar, has been plagued by protests and violence, including the infamous \"Saffron Revolution\" of 2007, led by Buddhist monks who were met with brutal suppression by the military.\n\nThe situation in Burma is just one example of a long history of governments trying to silence dissent and maintain control over their citizens. Throughout history, rulers have claimed divine right to absolute power, from early Roman emperors to Japanese emperors who were believed to be gods. Even in modern times, some leaders have used their positions to silence critics and opponents. For instance, President George W. Bush has been known to consult with Ted Haggard, the head of a conservative Christian group, on a regular basis.\n\nThere have been numerous examples of brutal suppression of dissent throughout history. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where students and intellectuals demanded an end to authoritarian rule, resulted in a reported death toll of between 200 and 3,000 people. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militias and the government killed an estimated 800,000 people, is another extreme example of state-sponsored violence. The Nazi regime's systematic persecution and murder of Jews and other minority groups during World War II is a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and hatred.",
            "Duke Ellington left a lasting impact on jazz primarily due to his extended career and his exceptional ability to shape his orchestra. While his piano presence is subtle in many of the compositions featured in this assignment, as a composer Ellington excelled in crafting rich and complex pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. He developed the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing intricately orchestrated sections that highlighted the distinct styles of individual band members. By doing so, Ellington also emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra, creating cohesive and original sounds to suit each piece. His mastery of each player's sound and how they interacted within the growing ensemble allowed him to create some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative approach to sound and voice in his work, particularly in Creole Love Call, where he uses voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This early example demonstrates Ellington's ability to enhance texture and color without the restrictions of lyrics. Creole Love Call, a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece, features six distinct choruses that showcase Ellington's ability to complement the style of his soloists. The piece's structure is as follows:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response exchange between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth and melodic voice that transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this chorus, the voice takes on the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: A brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tone color to this piece is just one example of a stylistic trait that runs throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound by blending the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "There was this persistent feeling inside of her that never seemed to be satisfied. It started when she was 14, as she was navigating the ups and downs of being a teenager. Three years later, at 17, she was still trying to make sense of it. She had come to the realization that she wanted someone rather than something, but nothing seemed to spark her interest in the guys around her. She often found herself pondering this strange phenomenon, trying to figure out what could be causing it. Theories had crossed her mind, but none of them seemed quite right.\n\nFor the most part, life at home was pretty laid-back. Her parents were easy-going and never argued with each other. They rarely argued with her either, except when she pushed her boundaries and asserted her independence. It was a trait that actually made her quite likable, given her friendly and outgoing personality.\n\nBut today was a different story. As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, she was startled by a faint scream from the kitchen and her mother's distressed voice. Her heart racing, she rushed into the room, asking \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother lying on the ground, wincing in pain. Her daughter quickly went to her side and put a supportive hand on her, trying to help. \"Ow... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother managed to say between deep breaths. The daughter sprang into action, helping her mother to the car and getting her comfortable in the backseat.\n\nThe hospital was a whirlwind of disinfectant and anxiety, but she was so focused on her mother's well-being that she didn't register the fear. She rushed her mother inside and called for medical help. A team of worried faces gathered around, and they quickly got her mother onto a rolling bed and whisked her away for immediate attention. Her daughter was left sitting anxiously, waiting for news.\n\nIt turned out her mother had taken a tumble off a stepping stool while trying to grab a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between adhering to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality. The study found that a \"modified Med diet score\" (aMed score), which emphasizes the consumption of plant-based foods, healthy fats, and fish, is associated with a reduced risk of CHD and stroke. This modified Med diet is characterized by higher intake of fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, monounsaturated fats, and fish, and lower intake of animal products and saturated fats, with moderate alcohol consumption allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that a Med diet is linked to a lower risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and that it's more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, these studies didn't specifically examine the relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of heart disease or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated the aMed diet score using questionnaires that asked participants about their nutrient intake over the past year. Almost all participants continued to participate throughout the 20-year study period.\n\nThe researchers validated the accuracy of the questionnaires and confirmed reports of heart disease, stroke, and other health outcomes through medical records, hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were not available, the researchers classified the cases as \"probable,\" which accounted for about 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks.\n\nTo account for individual variations in diet and better represent long-term dietary habits, the researchers averaged the aMed scores from multiple questionnaires over time. They also adjusted for potential confounders, such as age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing a statistical model, the researchers found that a higher aMed score was associated with a lower risk of CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 cases of CHD, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths were reported. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a devastating economic downturn. High unemployment rates, a collapsing housing market, and the downfall of top corporations left many wondering how this financial disaster occurred and how it can be prevented. To put it simply, the crisis was born from reckless and uninformed political decisions that pressured banks and companies to issue sub-prime loans into a fragile financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were forced to take on and repackage these mortgages into complex financial instruments, only to see the entire economy suffer when borrowers defaulted on these loans. The chaos then spread to the repackaged mortgages and, ultimately, the rest of the economy.\n\nThe roots of this financial disaster date back to the late 1990s, during the Clinton administration. President Clinton sought to bolster his popularity by relaxing lending restrictions, which ultimately created the perfect storm for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. As reported by Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999, Fannie Mae, the country's largest mortgage underwriter, was under pressure from the administration to expand mortgage loans to low- and moderate-income individuals, while also meeting the expectations of its shareholders. Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As previously discussed, the reckless lending practices would inevitably lead to a catastrophic economic collapse.\n \nA combination of factors contributed to the economic downturn, one of which was the complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led U.S. households and financial markets to become heavily invested in the housing market, leaving them vulnerable to even slight price changes. \nWhen the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities were severely affected. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for about 30% of the country's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a low price, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were taken over by the government in September 2008.",
            "Ah, the infamous exposition - that section of your story where your writing skills are put to the test, leaving readers either in awe or nodding off in their chairs. Dr. Merlin has been known to frantically click the 'undo' button more than once when she finds herself drowning in a sea of unnecessary details. Exposition, it seems, is not exactly a welcome guest in the world of storytelling.\n\nAs writers, we've all been warned about the perils of \"telling, not showing,\" but Dr. Merlin still succumbs to lengthy descriptions of backstories, often leaving readers wondering when the real story will begin. Exposition is the pesky critic on your shoulder, urging you to provide context at the expense of actual plot progression. It's the voice that whispers, \"Get the history out of the way so we can get to the good stuff.\"\n\nIn fiction, exposition is when an author chooses to tell the reader what's happening, rather than show it through action, dialogue, or sensory details. In film, it's often manifested as a character dumping a wealth of information on another character, usually in a clunky and info-dumpy way. Think of it as a literary equivalent of a \"core dump\" a la \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"\n\nTake, for instance, a story where the protagonist's love interest is introduced with a grandiose passage detailing their entire history: where they met, how they married, and the tragic circumstances of their partner's demise. It's unlikely that this lengthy exposition would unfold over two pages, with the couple barely exchanging a few lines of dialogue. Instead, a skilled author would weave a more nuanced introduction, gradually revealing the husband's character through their speech, mannerisms, and interactions. This would not only make the reader invested in their fate but also provide valuable insight into the protagonist's personality, values, and motivations.\n\nBy adding depth and context to the bare-bones narrative, you create an emotionally resonant connection between the reader and the characters. In short, you'd expect the story to deliver more than just the skeletal outline: \"They met, they married, he died.\" A good writer knows that there's no substitute for rich, sensory details that breathe life into the narrative.\n\nSo, the next time you find yourself tempted to skim over the surface-level details, remember that a good story is built on more than just exposition. Provide the meat, not just the bones.",
            "I recently watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio, which left me thinking about the way news is presented. The first one I tuned into was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). They had a breaking story about a man in Ashley, Ohio, who stabbed his wife. The man's name was Shad Hostettler, and the news team devoted a reasonable two minutes to the developing story, stating that he had stabbed her multiple times and been arrested. I believe this was an adequate amount of coverage for the circumstances.\n\nThe second story that caught my attention was about an early morning shooting of an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and no arrests had been made at the time. The SWAT team was investigating the crime, but this story seemed to be glossed over. I've noticed a pattern where minorities are often underreported when they're victims of a crime. In contrast, when a white person is a victim, the media tends to go into overdrive, whereas if it's a minority person, they're lucky if it even gets mentioned.\n\nThe news team then moved on to a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They shared details about the location where the incident occurred and stated that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for tips that could lead to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe forecast for the weekend was also covered, with predictions of rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. Temperatures were expected to remain in the mid to low eighties, but the segment was a bit too brief and seemed like a teaser to keep viewers hooked.\n\nAnother story they ran with was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, approximately six feet tall, and weighing around 150 pounds. I found it striking that they spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing his skin color and how dark he was.\n\nLastly, they covered a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. What caught my attention was that instead of stating the sentence as 25 years in prison, they mentioned \"300 months,\" which seemed unnecessary and possibly an attempt to make the sentence sound harsher. Additionally, they mentioned that he was a Hispanic man, which I didn't think was particularly relevant to the story.",
            "In the intricate web of human relationships, the bond between brothers stands out as an unbreakable and complex connection. This unique tie is woven with various emotions - love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty - making it hard to unravel. Brothers have a deep understanding of each other that goes beyond the realm of ordinary relationships, and when they look at their brothers, they see a reflection of themselves. It's during intense moments that the true nature of their bond reveals itself, whether it's a beautiful or a destructive one. These emotions come with a cost, and dealing with their consequences is an integral part of understanding the bond. When one brother looks into another and sees their own reflection staring back, they gain insight into their own character through their actions and the repercussions that follow.\n\nIn James Hurst's \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is expertly explored, along with the cluster of emotions that come with it. Against the backdrop of a rich, vivid landscape, two brothers embark on a doomed journey, where bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in a heart-wrenching climax. Only one brother manages to escape alive. The theme is skillfully conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as the narrator's perspective, which highlights the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and their perception of the world around them. Both of these greatly influence their actions.\n\nAt the core of the protagonist's behavior lies a single, driving emotion: pride. From their initial outings together until their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother who could learn from him and share in his adventures, like \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp.\" He wanted a companion to join him in racing to Horsehead Landing and perching in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's fragile health made these dreams seem impossible. Born with a weak heart, Doodle's prospects for survival, let alone participating in physically demanding activities, were slim to none. The young protagonist's fantasies were shattered in an instant, leaving him with a deep sense of disappointment and frustration. He even grapples with anger towards his brother, as revealed by his recollection of contemplating suffocating him with a pillow. Yet, his heart softens when Doodle smiles at him, revealing a glimmer of hope. This moment showcases the protagonist's innate love for his brother, which he had likely been hiding beneath his pride and anger.",
            "The human brain is a complex and innovative system that processes information in a multitude of ways. Over the years, our understanding of the brain has advanced, and so have the metaphors used to describe it. Initially, we thought of the brain like a simple wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and more recently, a computer. However, it's essential to remember that these metaphors are limited and can lead to oversimplification and incorrect conclusions.\n\nThe process of information processing starts when our sensory organs transform physical stimuli, such as touch, heat, sound, or light, into electrical signals. This sensory information is then repeatedly processed by the brain using both bottom-up and top-down approaches. For instance, when looking at a black box on a white background, the brain's bottom-up processing puts together basic information like color, orientation, and object borders to identify the box. Top-down processing then speeds up recognition by using the decisions made during bottom-up processing. It might help you identify the object as a black box instead of a hole in the background.\n\nAs information is processed to a certain level, an attention filter decides its importance and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when looking down, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually, but you might pick out your name in a noisy room. There are various stages of processing, and the results are constantly modulated by attention.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information is encoded in various ways specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically, depending on its appearance, sound, or meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Research suggests that working memory, which stores information for around 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a series of neurons for a short period. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained through the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are various models describing how knowledge is organized in the brain, each based on different approaches like human memory retrieval, computer science, or neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts and that these nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "In his thought-provoking novel, Brave New World, Aldous Huxley issues a stark warning about the dangers of unchecked technological advancements and the capitalistic systems that drive them. He creates a dystopian society where people value community over individuality and are conditioned to prioritize immediate gratification above all else. The citizens are mere pawns in a larger game, confined to a narrow ideology dictated by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can see Huxley's underlying concerns about the development of these systems, which eerily foreshadow the emerging economy of his time.\n\nHuxley uses Marxist concepts to satirize capitalism, highlighting the idea of false consciousness. In this context, the common citizenry is kept in the dark about their true relationships with other social classes, too focused on their own self-interest to grasp the bigger picture. This is achieved through the ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, as evident in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The lower classes, represented by Deltas and Gammas, are devoid of autonomy, with their drive to consume, spend, and indulge amplified through hypnopædia. The World Controller masterfully manipulates this desire, showcasing a clear example of hegemony, where a dominant group (the upper classes) exercises control over the others. The lower classes are oblivious to this manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that reinforces the existing social structure. Meanwhile, the upper classes, represented by Alphas and Betas, are aware of the manipulation but choose to accept their position, with few exceptions like Bernard.\n\nIn this world, meaningful relationships between individuals are non-existent. Characters are one-dimensional, lacking depth, which may suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism together rob people of their free will and emotional expression. Love and intense emotions are absent, replaced by superficial interactions, often reduced to shallow comments about physical appearance. The complacency of each social class within the hierarchy is a testament to the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where individuals are convinced of their superiority as long as they conform to the norms of their peers.",
            "As a student at University Park for over two and a half years now, I've experienced the challenges of navigating campus. For many of us, including myself, getting around campus can be a real issue. My freshman year, I was assigned to an East Halls dorm, which is situated on the far eastern edge of campus – excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. The commute from Stuart Hall, my hometown on campus, to classes in the Willard building, near the heart of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather is bad. I recently spoke to a fellow alumnus who's not much older than me, and they shared that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by vast tracts of unused land. Today, that empty space has been transformed into sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and the health services building, and surrounding apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. In my opinion, the best solution to this problem is the bicycle. However, having a bike is only half the battle – students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with the needs of bicyclists in mind.\n\nI had a conversation with a friend who recently took up bicycling again after a few-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped cycling in the first place. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is bicycling good for your physical health, but it's also the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more. As an off-campus resident, I'm just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was buying a bike. With my classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home, I can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only catch is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to navigate, whether I'm on a bike or on foot. While walking has its merits, I'm just too busy to do it. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class, and it would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That's over two and a half hours every week – time I just can't afford to spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I'm passionate about pursuing a career in social work, with a focus on helping children who have been abused or neglected, as well as supporting troubled families. Throughout my education, I've developed a set of core values that I believe are essential to this field: service, respect, an ethical nature, and a commitment to improving relationships and my own professional competence. These values are not just important to social workers, but also to me personally, as they reflect my own desires to help others and make a positive impact.\n\nAfter high school and college, I struggled to find a career path that aligned with my passions. Many people I met seemed to be avoiding their problems or using unhealthy coping mechanisms. Seeing this firsthand, I decided to pursue a degree in Psychology. Even after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted to do next. That all changed when I met a 16-year-old boy who was escaping his abusive parents. I drove to his parents' house with him and spoke with the police, expressing my concerns and sharing my background in Psychology. This experience opened my eyes to the need for social workers like me to help children like him.\n\nAnother value that drives me in social work is a commitment to social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuality, but often, we strive to conform to traditional norms. I'm proud to be an individual who refuses to be limited by what others expect of me. Throughout my high school and college years, I've actively protested against social injustice in my own way: expressing myself through fashion, speaking out against racism and discrimination, and advocating for the LGBTQ+ community through my involvement with GSBA. I believe in standing up for what's right and will continue to do so in my career as a social worker.\n\nI believe that my unique experiences, values, and commitment to social justice make me a strong candidate for a career in social work. I'm eager to make a difference in the lives of children and families in need, and I'm excited to start this journey.",
            "This paper explores the relationship between the Biological and Sociocultural models and insomnia, a complex sleep disorder. The biological model focuses on the genetic and medical factors that contribute to insomnia, while the Sociocultural model examines the environmental influences on sleep patterns, including demographics, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. This review examines the selected research studies related to these models, discusses their findings, and critiques their strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into three main groups: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders related to other mental health issues, or sleep disorders caused by medical complications or substance use. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias (difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep) and Parasomnias (behavioral or physiological sleep disorders). The Sociocultural models look at how environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status and ethnicity, impact sleep patterns.\n\nThe biological model focuses on the genetic and physiological aspects of sleep regulation. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that the activation of GABAA receptors on orexin neurons promotes sleep, while inhibition of these receptors can induce reduced anxiety and sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep time in mice, suggesting a potential genetic and environmental basis for sleep regulation in humans. This study has implications for understanding the biological basis of sleep disorders, including insomnia.\n\nFrom a Sociocultural perspective, if the phenotype of the GABAB receptor is inherited, it could regulate sleep patterns, and alterations to this receptor could naturally disrupt sleep. This could have significant impacts on daily life, including difficulties with concentration and focus. The Sociocultural model highlights the importance of considering environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status and ethnicity, in understanding insomnia.\n\nOverall, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Biological and Sociocultural models of insomnia, highlighting the complex interplay between genetic, physiological, and environmental factors that contribute to this complex sleep disorder.",
            "Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is a condition where the brain struggles to process and interpret auditory information. This doesn't mean that individuals with CAPD have a hearing problem or are unable to hear sounds. Instead, their brain's ability to distinguish between different sounds, identify patterns, and filter out background noise is impaired. As a result, people with CAPD may find it difficult to follow conversations, understand speech in noisy environments, or even make sense of auditory information they receive.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has been around for decades, dating back to the 1950s when researchers first described it as \"auditory imperception.\" Since then, studies have continued to evolve, with notable contributions from researchers such as Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, who developed tests for children with communicative disorders in the 1950s and 1960s. A national conference in 1977 helped stimulate research on CAPD in children, leading to a better understanding of the disorder.\n\nIndividuals with CAPD may exhibit a range of symptoms, including difficulty localizing sounds, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing patterns, and differentiating changes in speech. They may also struggle to filter out background noise, synthesize sound clues, and determine the sequence of auditory information. These challenges can impact daily life, making everyday tasks like following instructions or conversations more difficult.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive assessment, which may include observations of listening behavior, questionnaires, and standardized tests. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other specialists may use various measures to evaluate auditory-related skills. While there is no single test or tool that can diagnose CAPD with high accuracy, a combination of assessments can help identify the condition. These tests often present individuals with multiple auditory stimuli and ask them to differentiate between specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's response to these signals.",
            "The play Twelfth Night points out the risks of using deception as a means to achieve one's goals, particularly in a long-term sense. While disguise can be an effective tool for concealing one's true identity, it can ultimately lead to a loss of self if not abandoned. The problem with revealing a deception is that it can lead to feelings of alienation, as those who were deceived may struggle to reconcile their feelings and maintain relationships. This is especially true when it comes to deception in the form of gender role reversal, which raises questions about the motivations behind such actions. In Twelfth Night, Viola's decision to disguise herself as a man is driven by a desire for self-preservation. She feels the need to adopt a male persona in order to protect herself from potential harm, as evidenced by her statement: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\n\nThis deception, however, leads to Viola being disconnected from the women around her and creates a complicated web of relationships. Olivia, in particular, becomes infatuated with Viola in her disguise as Cesario, only to later shift her affections to Sebastian. This shift raises questions about Olivia's true feelings and whether they are genuine or a product of her societal expectations. The play may also suggest that deception can sometimes be a catalyst for revealing suppressed emotions, as seen in the relationships between Olivia, Orsino, and Viola/Cesario. Certain passages hint that these characters may have unexpressed desires that are brought to the surface by Viola's disguise. For instance, Olivia's ease in switching her affections from Cesario to Sebastian suggests that she may be more focused on social appearances than genuine emotional connections. Her eventual acceptance of Viola as her sister also implies that she may have been using her romantic feelings as a way to justify her societal expectations.",
            "When looking at the German colonial empire, it's clear that its approach to various territories was far from uniform. The brutal treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa is a stark example of this. However, it's essential to understand that the German colonial empire was a complex entity with diverse policies and ruling styles across its vast territories. Even education systems varied significantly from one colony to another.\n\nWhen the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found a well-educated and literate African population. In contrast, German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. But the situation in South West Africa, now known as Namibia, presented a stark contrast. Unlike in East Africa, where the government invested heavily in the education of local populations, in South West Africa, the task of educating the native population was largely left to missionary societies with limited government support. While the government invested in schools for Europeans and supported missionary schools, the majority of the African population remained uneducated and illiterate. This disparity had long-lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this divergence, and this paper aims to explore these factors in more detail. It will examine the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans and draw on new research to shed light on this complex issue.\n\nThe literature on education in the German colonial empire is extensive, with many studies focusing on specific colonies and systems. Early works, mainly written in German, aimed to describe the features of these educational systems. Later studies, written in English, provided more in-depth comparative analyses of education in the various German colonies. One notable study is Cohen's comparison of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which highlights the differences between the two colonies. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa played a significant role in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa's relatively temperate climate attracted a sizable European population. By 1913, over 15,000 whites lived in the colony, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population. These demographic differences had a profound impact on the educational systems of the two colonies, leading to the stark contrast between them.",
            "Heavy metal music has evolved significantly since its inception over 100 years ago, and the constant branching out into sub and sub-sub genres has made it challenging to define the entire realm of popular music. Many genres, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, have also spawned various sub-genres within their domains. One of the most expressive and diverse genres that has emerged over the past 40 years is Heavy Metal rock, which is characterized by its wide range of emotions, predominantly darker ones. This diversity is a result of its adaptability, allowing artists to create their own sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, which has led to a proliferation of niches and themes.\n\nIt's now difficult to pinpoint the exact definition of heavy metal, as it has incorporated elements from other genres and has branched out into numerous sub-niches. To truly understand the various types of metal music that exist today, it's essential to grasp the essence of the metal movement and its significance as a distinct entity.\n\nAt its core, heavy metal is a movement defined by its darker aspects, which can be seen as a \"music of more\" - more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. Metal musicians often possess impressive technical skills, which are evident in their music. The genre has also been heavily influenced by psychedelic drugs, particularly in the mid-70s, which led to the creation of crazy and otherworldly records. The movement has taken on many dark and visceral qualities, which were relatively new to the music scene at the time. Later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the darker aspects of the Romantic Era, resulting in lyrics that reflect the genre's darker side, such as those found in the song Helter Skelter by the Beatles.\n\nThese lyrics showcase the Beatles' exploration of the darker side, which some consider to be one of the first heavy metal songs. It was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker song, and the Beatles aimed to prove that they could match the Stones' intensity. This song was featured on The White Album, demonstrating its significance in the evolution of heavy metal music.",
            "Before the Surrealist movement took off, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own unique works, literally and figuratively. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is more than just a representation of a woman in awe of her surroundings - it's also a reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations and internal struggles as an artist. For years, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise from other artists and art lovers, but this goal came with a challenge: conform to the art world's expectations or forge his own path.\n\nTo understand The Dream, you need to know a bit about Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, he came from a family of modest means, with his father being a tinsmith and hardware dealer. Despite never receiving formal art training, Rousseau worked as a gabelou (municipal toll service employee) until age 40, earning the nickname douanier (customs inspector) along the way. After his wife Clémence's passing, which was followed by the loss of eight infant children, Rousseau was left with one child and a deep sense of grief. He turned to painting as a way to escape his sorrow and start anew.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized and sentimentalized the peasant experience in their artwork, Rousseau was a folk painter who drew from his own life and hopes. His desire for acceptance in the art world is understandable, given that he was self-taught and began his career at an older age, competing with talented and well-known modern artists like Matisse. As Jan Gordon notes in his book Modern French Painters, while Matisse feared painting trite works, Rousseau aimed to create conventional art that would earn him a spot among the Artiste Français.\n\nThe Dream is a testament to Rousseau's internal struggle to balance his desire for recognition with his need for creative independence. By examining his life and artistic journey, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities behind this iconic painting.",
            "Many thinkers have pondered the connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there's a fundamental reason for this relationship. As John Keats writes in his famous \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While our knowledge of life often stems from education or experience, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being formally taught these concepts. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than prescribe; they attempt to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nWhat's most noteworthy is that criticism of art or morals can't fully capture the essence of what's good or beautiful. When discussing the worth of a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa, we might focus on aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these elements don't truly convey why it's a great work of art. When asked about a favorite piece of art or literature, people often respond with phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a more in-depth analysis. I believe that both art and morals can't be reduced to a simple description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe the properties of a work of literature, there's still something intangible left. Ethics, much like art, possesses this transcendental quality, which provides a connection between the two.\n\nI propose that morality and art are closely linked because we experience both at a fundamental, noumenal level. They impact us in ways that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is particularly strong when it comes to literature, as it's an art form that inherently carries moral weight. As McKean noted, \"What distinguishes literature from other arts is its moral quality. While moral standards may not be relevant to other arts like music, they seem to be as applicable to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The modern Germany is a robust nation, boasting a unique cultural identity shaped by its history, from the sun-kissed Alps in Munich to the Baltic coast in Kiel. A similar cultural thread runs through the Rhine River city of Cologne, through the heart of Germany to the picturesque city of Dresden on the Elbe River. Given this rich cultural tapestry, it's no surprise that Germany's present identity is the result of a diverse blend of influences from various tribes and cultures.\n\nThe origins of the name \"Germany\" are shrouded in mystery, with scholars and historians debating its etymology. According to historical accounts, the name may have originated from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gauls. The Roman historian Tacitus, writing in the 1st century AD, attributed the name to this tribe. Conversely, Julius Caesar claimed to have borrowed the term \"Germanus\" from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes they had yet to defeat. While the true origin of the name remains uncertain, some propose that it refers to the Gaulish word for \"neighbor\" or perhaps the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" highlighting the Germans' reputation for being loud and boisterous.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote extensively on the origins of the Germans in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum.\" He described the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by immigration or external influences, and noted that the harsh climate, unforgiving terrain, and rugged culture of Germany would be an unlikely destination for outsiders. The Romans, despite their conquests, rarely settled in Germany, preferring to trade with the Germanic tribes and recruit them into their military ranks rather than establishing a permanent presence.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged in the 1st century AD, they inhabited the fringes of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and skills with the Romans. Their interactions with the empire laid the groundwork for the complex cultural identity that defines modern Germany, a nation born from the confluence of diverse influences and experiences.",
            "As I stood there, my mind went blank, and I stared at the unremarkable scene in front of me. My thoughts drifted in and out of my consciousness like wisps of smoke, never quite landing or sticking. It was a sensation I'd grown accustomed to, a practiced numbness that allowed me to observe without truly engaging. The image before me was a jumbled mess of details, and yet, it was as if I had no thoughts of my own, just a smooth, liquid experience of the present moment.\n\nI'd always wanted to learn how to draw, ever since I was a child. So, on the advice of an artist I'd worked with, I picked up a copy of The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. The book promised to teach me the fundamental principles of art, from understanding the basics of a pencil to the mental processes that govern our perception of lines. One technique stuck with me – framing a picture with a simple square, breaking down a complex scene into a manageable form.\n\nAt that moment, however, I was too overwhelmed to apply that technique. The scene before me was too rich, too detailed, and I felt like I was drinking from a firehose. I was a blank slate, staring at the unremarkable bowl of brown matter in front of me, trying to make sense of it all. It was as if I was standing at the beginning of a journey, the start of my own artistic journey, and I felt the weight of that responsibility.\n\nMy hand, however, was eager to create. My fingers flexed, and my hand hovered over the toilet handle, poised to take action. But instead of drawing or painting, I ended up smacking the handle again, trying to dislodge the stubborn, brown package that refused to budge. I stood there, fuming, my green tie feeling like a noose around my neck. I was a janitor at Rite Aid, and it seemed like no one appreciated the art I brought to my work – the delicate dance of soap and water, the soothing sound of a toilet flushing.\n\nAs I stood there, one last time, I gripped the toilet paper roll, my hand molding itself into a makeshift mitt. Then, with a deep breath, I reached in, my hand dipping slowly into the bowl like a mother carefully placing a turkey in the oven. It was a mundane task, but in that moment, it felt like a work of art, a moment of creative expression in an otherwise dull, ordinary life.",
            "Each year, a disturbing number of teenagers lose their lives on the roads.  Several factors contribute to this alarming trend.  The National Institutes of Health point out that the teen brain simply isn't yet equipped to handle the dangers of driving.  Additionally, the lack of driving experience is a major contributor to the problem.  This inexperience not only results in a higher rate of fatal accidents, but also an increased likelihood of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeens also tend to fare poorly when driving with their peers, a fact that's hardly surprising given how often they do it.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a clear correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents that occur.  In an effort to improve teen safety, some states have implemented provisional driver's licenses that limit the hours teens can drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\nHowever, I believe that provisional licenses are merely a temporary fix.  The real issue is that, as a group, young drivers are simply not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.  According to psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license.  His research suggests that those under the age of 19 or 20 often have a strong desire to take risks for the thrill of it.  It makes sense, then, to delay driving until this tendency has begun to subside.  If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, we can expect to see even more deadly accidents and a staggering death toll in the years to come.  By 2010, the Baby Boomers' children will be eligible to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will be hitting the road.\n\nLegislation addressing this issue would be relatively straightforward.  Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full license, and a set number of practical driver's training hours would still be required.  The specific number of hours could be based on the requirements of the majority of states, such as the 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult currently required in California.  Uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country.  This idea is certainly not new.",
            "While browsing through the vast collection of early Edison films at the Library of Congress, I decided to take a closer look at the 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films often employ creative editing techniques to create illusions that captivate the viewer. My film analysis focused primarily on dissecting the poetics behind the majority of trick films and examining the unique characteristics present in a few of the later films that dared to break the mold. For the most part, trick films from the turn of the century are confined to a set-bound format, adhering to a strict one shot = one film methodology, featuring stationary cameras, long shots, and medium shots.\n\nHowever, a few films from the early 20th century began to challenge these conventions by introducing innovative elements such as multiple shots. One of the most notable similarities among trick films is their use of an interior set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary, never moving to follow figures or objects. This composition drew inspiration from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations of this style is that figures in trick films tend to move side-to-side, rather than towards or away from the camera. For instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, never venturing beyond the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also results in a predominantly use of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-up shots are notably absent in all the trick films from the Edison catalog. This convention is a nod to the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would witness the entire performance at any given time, framed within the borders of the stage. In early films, actors rarely move from the middle ground towards the camera, making close-ups a rarity.\n\nMost early trick films follow the pattern where one conceptual shot equals one film, limiting their length to approximately a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. This restriction also constrains the narrative or dramatic usage of trick films, which typically focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and switching antics with minimal storylines. Interestingly, however, a single \"shot\" in a trick film can actually comprise several joined shots to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong advocate for Republicanism, driven by his passion for agriculture and his brief stint in politics. As a result, he developed a reputation for being fiercely dedicated and outspoken on matters of personal freedom and government. His commitment to an agrarian-based system influenced his views on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system. He believed that preserving and promoting this ideal form of work was crucial in shaping his opinions on governance.\n\nIn Taylor's opinion, the United States had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system of self-government, unencumbered by native traditions. He firmly believed in the natural rights of individuals, which he argued were interconnected, and that denying one right would compromise the value of the remaining rights. Consequently, he believed that these rights should be beyond the reach of the government. He saw the concept of the \"state of nature\" as a reality where the strong and cunning profited, but in a civilized society, this was not acceptable.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be designed to account for the inherent good and evil within humanity. He was resolute in his dualistic morality, stating that as government is exercised by humans, it will reflect both virtues and vices. He defined good principles as those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism, which he believed would lead to a government that functioned equitably, regardless of its administration. However, self-interest, which he saw as a fundamental human motivation, was only considered evil when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.\n\nTaylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, seeking an extremely limited Federal government with no more rights or powers than those explicitly stated in the document. He recognized that an extensive Federal government would be expensive and potentially tyrannical. However, he also believed that a simple, literal interpretation was inadequate, as it could lead to corruption without considering the intent of the founders. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking at the data shown in Figure 17, it's clear that there was a significant drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. At first glance, this was a bit of a letdown, and it's tough to pinpoint the reason behind it. With the onset of winter on a New England campus, it's likely that the decrease in bike and foot traffic played a part in the decline. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a time when students are busy wrapping up schoolwork and dealing with final exams, which might have caused the commuter log to fall off many people's radar. The holiday season also kicked in during this time, followed by a month-long break for students and faculty, which probably contributed to the low numbers. Even when classes resumed in late January, submissions remained low, raising the question of whether this was a temporary lull or a sign of a more permanent drop in engagement. One possibility is that any project of this nature tends to have an initial surge of enthusiasm, followed by a gradual decline. To combat this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign aimed at reviving the initiative, which successfully resulted in an uptick in log submissions for that month. However, this still left us wondering how to maintain momentum in the face of the inevitable dip in engagement that occurs when students and faculty are on break. \n\nAnother challenge that came up during this project (and one that's likely to arise in any alternative commuting initiative) is the fact that driving a car gives people a sense of freedom and independence that's deeply ingrained in our culture. To overcome this, we offered incentives in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, and other establishments. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes, such as a new bike or a hybrid/electric car, might have impacted participation. Perhaps if we had announced these larger prizes in December and January, that might have helped to mitigate the dip in engagement that we experienced. The value of the prizes didn't change over the course of the project, but if we had upped the ante, it's possible that participation would have remained strong rather than dipping.",
            "In the world of investing, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have gained popularity due to their unique combination of characteristics - flexibility, diversification, and low expense ratios. An ETF is essentially a security that tracks an index, commodity, or a basket of assets, similar to an index fund, but trades on an exchange like a stock. This enables investors to reap the benefits of single stock ownership, such as short-selling, buying on margin, and purchasing as few as one share in a transaction. Furthermore, ETFs offer a wider variety of funds to choose from, making it easier for investors to find the right fit for their investment goals.\n\nHowever, as with any investment, there are some downsides to consider. For instance, ETFs come with a commission on trades, similar to buying or selling stocks. Despite these minor drawbacks, the benefits of ETFs are undeniable. In this analysis, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning a single ETF is equivalent to a diversified portfolio of the individual stocks. We will also investigate whether a reconfigured portfolio of the same stocks could provide a better return and lower beta.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below is a list of the top 10 holdings and their corresponding percentage of total assets.\n\nTo gauge the effectiveness of these 10 stocks in representing the ETF as a whole, we will calculate their contributions to a portfolio's beta and return if the portfolio were made up entirely of these stocks in the proportions determined by the ETF's holdings. The calculations are included in the chart below.\n\nThe chart clearly shows that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF. Based on these results, it appears that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta. Nevertheless, it's essential to verify whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo determine this, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "It's interesting to note that Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" one of his standout poems. In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, which is a reference to a mysterious island located north of Britain, viewed by the Greeks as the edge of the world. However, Virgil is not the only source for this term, as some scholars suggest that Poe may have been influenced by German literature. Poe was indeed a fan of German authors, including Goethe. \n\nIn fact, a closer look at Goethe's work \"Faust\" reveals a poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king who is heartbroken after his wife's passing, and he turns to excessive drinking. The poem's themes of loss and despair are eerily similar to those found in \"Dream-Land.\" It's possible that Poe was paying homage to Goethe's work, as scholar Karl J. Arndt notes in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon.\" Furthermore, Goethe's \"Faust\" was a celebrated work of poetic drama, published in two parts in 1808 and 1832, respectively. The parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are striking, with both works exploring themes of loss, grief, and the human condition.\n\nPoe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in his collected writings is notable, with references in both \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land.\" The two poems can be seen as companion pieces, with \"The King of Thulé\" serving as a dark reflection of the themes found in \"Dream-Land.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape, haunted by the memories of loved ones, while in \"The King of Thulé,\" Goethe's king is similarly consumed by grief after the loss of his wife.\n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Tennyson and his familiarity with German literature, it's likely that he would have been aware of Goethe's work. In fact, Poe's respect for Tennyson suggests that he would have been exposed to Goethe's writings through various reproductions and translations that were popular at the time.",
            "In a recent court case, a woman named Jennifer Palmer is suing D&D Markets for punitive damages after she slipped and fell on an applesauce spill at the store. The store manager, Paul Martin, was informed about the spill not once, but twice, and chose to ignore it for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner. The question is whether Martin's actions were malicious enough to warrant punitive damages under California law. \n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Palmer's claim outright. To win punitive damages, she'll need to show that Martin's actions were done with a reckless disregard for the harm they would cause. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known about the dangers of leaving a spill unattended, given that several customers had slipped and fallen due to similar incidents at the store in the past. However, it's less clear whether Martin's actions were truly malicious, given that he had been warned twice about the spill. Still, Palmer has a strong argument that Martin failed to act with the necessary care to ensure customer safety, especially given the six slip-and-fall incidents at the store in 2009.\n\nAccording to court records, on October 13, 2009, two employees, Rich Wayne and Mary J. Haddigan, separately informed Martin about the applesauce spill, but he dismissed their concerns, saying he was busy eating dinner. Thirty minutes later, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, severely injuring her back. Prior to her accident, five other customers had reported slipping and falling at the store that year.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The law defines malice as conduct that was intended to cause harm or was done with a \"despicable\" disregard for others' safety. The court has ruled that conduct is malicious when the defendant is aware of the likely harm their actions will cause and deliberately chooses to ignore it. In this case, Palmer may have a strong case for punitive damages, but it will ultimately depend on how the court interprets Martin's actions and intentions.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took an Islam course at CBC, and one topic continues to fascinate me to this day: whether Islam is inherently a hostile religion. In my opinion, this question is more relevant now than ever, especially considering the shift in media portrayals of Islam and its adherents since 9/11. It's intriguing to think about the possibility of a presidential candidate with a strong Muslim background, like Barack Obama, running for office in 2001. \n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has always piqued my interest. The more I learn about Muhammad's life, the more I'm struck by the contrast between the historical figure and the depiction in his biography. I previously believed that Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing his religion on them. However, the biography presents a different narrative – one of a humble and self-effacing figure who was misunderstood and humbled himself to others. It was only after people witnessed his teachings that they came to see the truth in them. \n\nWhat's even more striking is the similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. For instance, the story of multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men is a notable example. The way this story is told makes me think that the authors wanted Muhammad to be seen as a prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and performed miracles. This approach, however, undermines the significance of Jesus' life and teachings. It's as if they're attempting to steal and co-opt the essence of Jesus' message through Muhammad. \n\nAnother aspect of the biography that raises questions is the way it presents stories of people converting to Islam. While the authors aim to demonstrate the truth of these stories, the fact that they're often based on second-hand accounts from multiple people makes me skeptical. I think this approach diminishes the impact of the stories and makes them seem suspicious. \n\nWhat bothers me most is the way the biography portrays Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man. However, historical accounts contradict this image, and I'm left wondering if modern Muslims are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The core teachings of Jesus and the original beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly abandoned as Christianity evolved after his passing.  If we look at this historical trend in broad strokes, it appears that Christianity has been moving further and further away from its roots over time.  However, there is an increasing awareness and a progressive movement in today's world that could potentially alter this trajectory.  While traditionalists may resist any ideas that diverge from their established beliefs, they might not be influential enough to dictate the future of the faith.  As time progresses, Christians will increasingly become aware of the history of their faith and crave a closer understanding of the original intentions of Jesus' teachings.  It may take several decades or even centuries, but it's inevitable that we will see a major shift in the course of Christian history, resulting in a return to the faith's original form.  A movement will emerge that will systematically peel away the layers of doctrine that have been added over time, effectively reversing the clock and returning to the core principles that Jesus introduced to humanity in the name of God.  When this trend gains momentum in the United States and Europe, it will spread across the masses, prompting a return to the simplicity of following Jesus' ideas as they were intended, rather than the complex interpretations that have developed over time.  The church will continue to serve as a guiding institution, but its influence will be characterized by a growing uniformity of belief and practice.  Rather than differences between regions, denominations, and divisions, we can expect to see increasing similarities.  History has shown us that great reversals can occur, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution.  Similarly, our nation has progressed from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The impending reversal in the Christian faith will be a significant event that will undo the accumulated complexities of history and seek out the faith's original source, resulting in a unification of the diverse branches of Christianity.  A crucial factor in making this process possible will be the shift from interpreting Jesus' words as literal statements to understanding them as metaphors.  So what led to the transformation of Christianity over time?\n\nLooking back into history, we find that the seeds of the Christian faith were planted in Judaism, the theological foundation of the Christian religion.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the core elements of monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were already in place.  However, the Jewish population was not a unified entity, with various groups, such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people, each with their own distinct spirit and perspective.",
            "I firmly believe that The Jungle portrays the darker aspects of human nature, exposing people's inherent selfishness and self-centeredness. Deep down, many individuals are primarily concerned with their own well-being and success, often disregarding the needs and welfare of those around them. The novel masterfully illustrates this concept through the actions of the factory owners and managers. Their sole focus is on expanding their businesses and increasing their wealth, without any regard for the consequences or harm caused to others. As Upton Sinclair so vividly describes, the factory's towering structures and smoke-belching chimneys symbolize the devastating impact of their greed. The pollution and unsanitary conditions surrounding Packingtown are a stark reminder of the owners' disregard for human and animal life.\n\nMoreover, the owners and managers showed a blatant disregard for their employees, whom they exploited for their own gain. They would stop at nothing to save a buck, even if it meant subjecting their workers to inhumane conditions and long working hours. The novel starkly highlights the lack of empathy and decency in the workplace, where a worker's value was measured solely by their productivity, not their human worth. The absence of labor regulations and worker protections during that era allowed the factory owners to operate with impunity, forcing their employees to endure grueling conditions and live in squalor. Although the novel doesn't explicitly state it, the workers who toiled and suffered in Packingtown were essentially treated like slaves, with no access to resources, information, or support. Even the unions that formed to protect workers often ended up taking advantage of them, further exacerbating their struggles.\n\nThe novel paints a grim picture of a system where workers were trapped, with no escape from the cruel and unforgiving world of Packingtown. As Sinclair so eloquently puts it, the consequences of this system were as inevitable and widespread as those under chattel slavery.",
            "When authors write novels, they often use various techniques to evoke certain feelings or attitudes from their readers. These techniques can be quite effective, and F. Scott Fitzgerald is no exception. In his iconic novel The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald employs several of these techniques to shape the reader's perception of key subjects. One of these techniques is pairing an adjective and a noun in a way that doesn't typically mesh, to create an unexpected aura around the subject. Another technique is assigning meaning to a symbol, only to reuse it for the same purpose later on. Fitzgerald frequently uses the latter technique with colors, including gold, green, white, and various shades of pink and red. In The Great Gatsby, he gradually builds up connotations for certain colors, particularly white and gray, before utilizing them to convey a specific emotion or feeling associated with a pivotal object.\n\nFitzgerald develops the meaning of white and gray in the beginning of the novel, implying uniformity and a sense of sameness. White is portrayed as somewhat upscale and refined, while gray is depicted as more aged and faded. He initially establishes this meaning by consistently using these colors throughout the novel. For example, Daisy and Jordan are often seen wearing white, and even other characters like Nick wear white attire to Gatsby's parties. However, when Nick describes the party, he notes the use of \"primary colors,\" which stands out from the predominantly white-and-gray aesthetic. Fitzgerald further reinforces this meaning by using these colors to describe mundane, unremarkable subjects, such as Nick's commute to work or the apartment buildings in the city. He also applies these colors to ordinary people or places, like Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood\" or the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes.\n\nAfter establishing the meaning of white and gray, Fitzgerald uses them to signify a lack of importance or uniformity in various subjects, starting with Daisy. After a period of relative scarcity of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as dressed in white in a \"little white roadster,\" giving readers the impression that she is not a fully fleshed-out character, but rather a uniform, something that Gatsby desires but cannot attain. Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly to give the impression of Daisy as a more uniform, unremarkable figure, such as when he describes a \"gray haze\" around her fur collar or her wearing a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County boasts an incredibly productive agricultural sector, thanks to its pleasant, sunny climate. The region grows a wide variety of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. Interestingly, there's a significant demand for locally produced, organic community-supported agriculture food in the area, with numerous organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many of these farms offer tours of their agricultural operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. By adopting organic farming practices, landowners can benefit from government programs while also protecting and enhancing local habitats, thus allowing for recreational use and educational opportunities.\n\nWhile organic farming offers many benefits, including greater biodiversity due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water, it often comes with higher costs. Organic farming requires more labor and management to control pests and weeds, fertilize the soil without chemicals, and mitigate losses, which can be greater than those experienced with conventional methods. Additionally, small organic farms are often less efficient than larger operations and may face higher labor costs for practices that benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species control, and managing plant growth to create specific conditions like edge habitats or open patches of ground.\n\nThe proposed land for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land features a mix of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered or declining. These species include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The parcel was part of an original homestead patent, suggesting it was used for grazing and/or wood production for many years.\n\nI selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched government programs to determine the options available to a small farmer seeking to mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what someone farming this land might attempt to achieve, I drew inspiration from an organic farm in the same area.",
            "In any negotiation, understanding the role of culture is vital. However, culture is not a fixed entity that can be easily defined or stereotyped. It's more often a complex tapestry of nuances, where what culture is not can be just as telling as what it actually is. Broad statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify the richness of a culture. Instead, a negotiator should focus on grasping the significance of a culture in the context of the negotiation, and how it will impact the discussion at hand.\n\nWhen engaging with a foreign culture, we inevitably draw parallels to our own, often leading to misunderstandings. To navigate these differences, one must not only study a culture's history and prejudices but also be willing to accept it for what it is, rather than judging or trying to change it. This acceptance is especially crucial when dealing with a weaker bargaining position or negotiating in a foreign territory. Demonstrating respect for a culture's traditions and beliefs can be a powerful tool in bridging cultural divides and moving the negotiation forward.\n\nCulture is not limited to national or international boundaries. Companies within a nation often develop their own unique corporate culture, characterized by distinct values, communication styles, and hiring practices. For instance, some companies prioritize long work hours, while others encourage a more relaxed schedule. Employee dress codes, communication styles, and philanthropic efforts can all reveal the underlying corporate culture. Even within the same nation, different companies and regions can exhibit vastly different corporate cultures.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's values is equally crucial, as they provide the underlying motivations and driving forces. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior. On the other hand, a culture that places a high value on a hard-driven bargain may not be inclined to settle quickly. By considering these cultural nuances before the negotiation, a negotiator can gain a crucial edge. However, it's equally important to learn about the personal dynamics of the opposing party, as this can be the key to a successful negotiation.",
            "It's often said, \"There is no God,\" but this phrase is something that both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas strongly disagree with, as seen in their respective writings on the existence of God. Both of these thinkers present arguments in defense of the same concept of God, so in order to compare their theories, we'll assume they're correct in their belief in the God of the Bible. After all, comparing their arguments to a God figure that doesn't resemble the one they're defending wouldn't allow for a fair comparison.\n\nWhen looking at their arguments, it's clear that neither of them provides a complete basis for believing in God. One of the main issues with their arguments is that they both miss the bigger picture. I think this point can be best understood by examining the basic arguments of each author in more detail.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument is based on the idea that we can find proof of God's existence within our own minds. He suggests that because we can't effectively conceive God's nonexistence, it's clear that he exists. While this idea may be a bit confusing at times, the basic gist is that the proof for God lies within our own understanding. This idea is often referred to as faith within Christian texts, and it's based on the idea that we don't need external evidence to prove the existence of God - just our own knowledge.\n\nOn the other hand, St. Thomas Aquinas has a very different approach. He believes that we can prove God's existence using reason and empirical evidence alone, with no need for faith. This idea would be useful in spreading the message of Christianity because it would allow new converts to be convinced through logic rather than faith. Aquinas presents five different logical arguments to support the existence of God, which include change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Essentially, he argues that the existence of God is a logical necessity - if you're missing one puzzle piece, you can still understand its features and existence without actually seeing it.",
            "In the early days of recorded history, a prince was born, who would one day be known as the Buddha. As time passed, he abandoned his royal life and embarked on a spiritual journey that led to his enlightenment. His teachings eventually gave rise to Buddhism, with the Theravada sect being one of its most traditional forms. This ancient faith is over 2,500 years old, and it's undergone significant changes since the Buddha's time. For instance, in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, the annual water-cutting ceremony is an event that's deeply rooted in tradition, although the Buddha never mentioned it. This illustrates the extent to which the religion has evolved over time, from its superficial customs to its fundamental principles. As a result, the Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its doctrine in response to both internal and external influences, some of which have been hostile and others benevolent.\n\nThroughout this discussion, we'll be using certain key terms. An internal force is defined as a factor that arises from within the Buddhist community, regardless of whether its members are monks or laypeople. In contrast, an external force refers to any influence from outside the Buddhist community. A hostile force is any force that harms or seeks to damage the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of the faith. On the other hand, a benign force is one that doesn't aim to harm or help the community, but may inadvertently have either effect.\n\nTo begin with, it's essential to understand the core principles of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, which is comprised of three baskets of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka provides the metaphysical framework of Buddhism. This framework includes concepts such as Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of everything). Only by recognizing these concepts can one break free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which continues endlessly. Along with Sansara, one's attachment to lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) will also cease when one becomes enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for laymen and monks alike, with five precepts for laymen (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances) and a more detailed set of disciplinary rules for monks. The most fundamental concept in Buddhism is the four noble truths: Dukkha, the truth that life is suffering; the attachment that causes suffering; the possibility of overcoming suffering; and the path to achieve that liberation.",
            "The rivalry between the United States and Mexico is a prime example of a longstanding feud that spanned an impressive 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The peak of this animosity was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the U.S. gained the upper hand and claimed Texas and the Southwest as its own territory. The tension between the two nations was fueled by numerous clashes, which eventually subsided just before the outbreak of World War I. The initial spark of this rivalry emerged from fundamental differences in their values, customs, and faith, along with significant disparities in their material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). \n\nThis type of long-standing rivalry is not unique to the U.S. and Mexico; many nations bordering their neighbors often develop opposing interests, contributing to the formation of deep-seated rivalries. The U.S. and Mexico are not alone in their historical tensions with their neighboring countries; David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that Mexico and Cuba are the only two nations that have consistently posed significant diplomatic problems for the U.S. (p. 41). Both of these countries are geographically close to the U.S. and have historically vied for its attention, whereas many other Latin American nations have maintained more positive relationships with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in the rift between the two nations, a common thread in the history of various international conflicts. Sally Frahm (2001) points out that, \"if Americans opposed fascism and communism in the 20th century, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries\" (p. 86). In a similar vein, the ideological struggle between the U.S. and the Soviet Union during the Cold War was, in part, a clash over core values and vital interests. In the case of the U.S. and Mexico, however, the underlying conflict was rooted in their differing religious preferences, inherited from their colonial past. This inherent distrust was a major obstacle to establishing friendly diplomatic relations between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during the 57-year rivalry period. The majority of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems. The problem of bandits and outlaws from American border towns further exacerbated tensions until both nations deployed military force along their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nThe rivalry between the two nations began to subside as \"Mexico became increasingly reliant on the United States\" (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109) and eventually ended as U.S. ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, my life took an unexpected turn when I suddenly fell ill with an illness I was previously unaware of. At the time, I was working as a nurse, a profession I had chosen for the stability and security it offered, especially given my tumultuous childhood. The constant reassurance was that \"you'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" Thus, even though my true aspirations lay in science and journalism, I pursued nursing. \n\nHowever, fate had other plans. At 46, I was left with little savings, unable to work, and facing a future shrouded in uncertainty. Fifteen years of living off social security disability have left me with nothing to call my own. Each day is a struggle, a constant battle for security, safety, and self-esteem. Yet, amidst the chaos, one truth remains: I couldn't have navigated these difficult years without the unwavering support of my family and a handful of loyal friends. In times of true crisis, one's strength is often an illusion. \n\nMy point is that life is unpredictable, and emergencies can strike at any moment, big or small. No matter how well-prepared one is, some challenges are too great to overcome alone. \n\nWhile I agree that the US needs to rethink its reliance on a faltering government, I firmly believe that a more effective solution lies in fostering a culture of mutual support and help among Americans. Rather than relying solely on the government, we should encourage people to trust and rely on one another. This approach would be a more effective safeguard against life's uncertainties. \n\nThe notion of rugged individualism, often touted by American conservatives, is often romanticized. However, the true secret to the success of our forefathers was not their isolation but their compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast alone; they relied on each other for survival. \n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I have my own disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and other essentials. If you have the means, consider starting a small farm or acquiring a wood stove. But while you're at it, take the time to get to know your neighbors. Building a community that looks out for one another is the most effective way to navigate life's uncertainties.",
            "Evolutionary changes in organisms have long been a subject of interest and debate among scientists. One question that has puzzled researchers for years is what drives the direction of evolutionary change. It's surprising that even today, despite the significant progress made in understanding organic forms, defining them in mathematical terms remains a daunting task. However, recent studies have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk development, both during their growth and throughout their evolutionary history (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our current research aims to explore how mathematical modeling, combined with experimental studies, can help explain the mechanisms behind the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum. \n\nTo achieve this, we employed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify key parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were then input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). By using these parameters, we created hypothetical shell morphologies that can help us understand the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. The results of our study are being integrated with experimental and descriptive research to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nConsidering a shell as a tube that moves through 360 degrees of space over time, we can break it down into distinct components. The revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis, known as the columella, runs through the central column of the shell. The speed at which the whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line separating each whorl is called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all the whorls except the last, while the apex is the tip of the spire and the base is the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nStudying shells involves examining them from various angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. Typically, shells are viewed from an apertural perspective, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first viewing the shell from the apical perspective and determining where the first suture begins. By drawing a line to divide the shell into two parts, we can then count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl. \n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal grows its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture, we can use coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented, allowing us to formulate a mathematical model of the mollusk's skeletogenesis. Once we have a mathematical formulation, we can then vary parameters to modify the mollusk's development.",
            "For the past decade, Indonesia has seen little progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality rates.  Despite making significant strides in achieving Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the country still lags behind in improving child and maternal health indicators.  To understand the reasons behind these shortcomings, it's essential to examine the health system's weaknesses, rather than focusing solely on program-specific interventions.\n\nOne area of improvement has been the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this target.  However, this statistic includes traditional workers like midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complicated pregnancies and, as a result, contribute to high maternal mortality rates due to hemorrhage.  This achievement is somewhat misleading, highlighting the need for further action.  Furthermore, there's been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a healthcare professional.  Data on postnatal care is incomplete, but it's clear that this area is a concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nThe cesarean-section rate in Indonesia remains unacceptably low at around 4%.  This rate is even more concerning when considering the significant disparity between urban and rural areas, with a 5% difference between the two.  This disparity is a clear indication of unequal access to healthcare services, with a focus on urban areas.  Another issue is the lack of vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  It's clear that the poor face significant challenges in accessing healthcare services, largely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to effectively address the lack of service.  Should Indonesia focus on developing program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system, prioritizing the well-being of mothers and children before and after pregnancy?  While programmatic approaches may seem appealing due to their targeted objectives and potential for faster results, there are significant drawbacks to consider.  One major concern is that investing heavily in one area can lead to a lack of funding and resources for other critical areas, causing a brain drain of skilled healthcare workers.  Additionally, running multiple parallel programs for the same area can result in duplication of services, increased paperwork, and inefficiencies.",
            "Victorian novels are often associated with their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the time period.  However, two novels that stand out from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both of these novels incorporate elements of mystery and a touch of the bizarre, which deviates from the typical characteristics of the era.  This unique approach enhances the characters within each work, offering a deeper look into their thoughts and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist delves into the darker side of the period, the author skillfully weaves together a complex web of thoughts and events.  The main character's mind is flooded with jumbled ideas, making it difficult for him to distinguish reality from fantasy.  In one particular instance, Oliver finds himself walking between Sikes and Crackit, who are engaged in a heated argument.  The words they speak seem to echo in his mind, and when he regains his composure, he realizes that he's having a conversation with them.  Suddenly, the sound of gunfire shatters the atmosphere, and Oliver is swept away by an unseen force.  Throughout this chaotic scene, Oliver experiences a nagging sense of pain, which haunts him relentlessly.\n\nBoth novels use dream sequences or dreamlike states to convey this sense of mystery, although the content and purpose vary between the two.  Oliver Twist often employs these strange occurrences to reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, his deep-seated fears, and his perception of the world around him.  When Oliver relives the shooting scene in chapter 28, he does so in a state of vivid imagination, as if it's a recurring nightmare.  This passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the events that unfold, as well as the dire state of his health, which is reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit.  The shooting overwhelms Oliver, numbing his senses as he's whisked away by an unseen force.  He's forced to relive his despair, his pain now constant and linked to fear rather than surprise.  This scene raises questions about whose will led to his misfortune, as it was certainly not his own.  Oliver's growing sense of defeat is also implied, as if Fagin's influence has broken him, forcing him to accept this despair and rendering him unable to react.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the author similarly employs dreamlike states to convey the turmoil and mystery of the characters.  The passage describes the passage of time as a perpetual state of limbo, with days blurring together and nights feeling both long and fleeting.  This sense of timelessness reflects the characters' own emotional states, which are characterized by a sense of desperation and longing.",
            "A couple of years ago, I worked at an after-school program where I tutored elementary age students in various subjects. My strengths were in English and reading, and I was assigned to help a boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. As I worked with him, I realized that something was amiss - he had an unusual problem with reading. Some letters he could pronounce perfectly, while others were way off. It was quite peculiar. Adrian's parents were of Latino descent, but he spoke perfect English, which only added to the confusion. We made little progress until I met his mother, who only spoke Spanish. With my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read just fine, but he just didn't know the English alphabet well. I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the problem of the language barrier in schools, particularly in California. It's not always as obvious as we think, and even a child who speaks perfect English can still struggle with reading. Everyone agrees that this problem exists, so what's the solution? In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading, especially the alphabet and pronunciations, was relatively straightforward. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these alone will fix the problem. The key lies in combining them all.\n\nThe dual language system is an excellent idea, not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Studies have shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many fear that this approach is a waste of resources, but that's a misconception. If we were to implement these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all children would benefit from them. So, how do we do it? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic. Instead, we could have special aids, tutors, or whatever you call them, who are bilingual.",
            "For most of us, the concept of something greater than ourselves has been instilled in us since childhood. We've been taught about it in Sunday school, at Temple, or in our own introspection. Some of us accept the faith passed down to us from our parents, while others reject it entirely, believing that there's no truth beyond our own personal perspectives. We might switch between different value systems, searching for a guiding light in the darkness. This search for meaning helps us define ourselves and find our own unique sense of spirituality.\n\nI recall a conversation with my dad, where he revealed his favorite type of bird – the cardinal.  We sat on our porch, listening to the rain, the smell of our cigarettes lingering in the air. The sound of the rainwater rushing through the gutters and drowning the nearby plants created a melancholic atmosphere. My dad's appearance had changed in recent months; he'd lost weight, and his hair had thinned out. He stared into the rain, lost in thought, avoiding eye contact. I felt a mix of emotions – loneliness, fear, and the inability to talk to him about his impending passing. I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in gazing out into the rain, trying to cherish the moment.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his life, but not alleviated his suffering. I couldn't understand the purpose of prolonging his suffering. I stopped praying, wondering if God had stopped listening to me long ago. If there was a God, I thought, he must have stopped caring about me.\n\nI didn't want to witness my father's final moments, so I chose not to be there. I wanted to remember him for the life he lived, not the way he died. I knew my dad better than anyone, and I believed he wouldn't have wanted me to be a spectator to his passing. I spent three days curled up in bed, waiting for the news. But no one even bothered to call me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is an intriguing oxymoron that encapsulates the essence of something both old and new.  As Ian Watt so eloquently puts it, \"Gothic Novel\" is, in essence, 'Old-New.' The Gothic mode has been met with both praise and criticism, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others admiring its ability to evoke the 'terrible sublime' (Burke).  In creating the first \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto skillfully blended elements of both the old and modern romance genres, forging a new literary path. Walpole cleverly combined ancient theatrical elements and modern novelistic mimicry to craft a story he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). This novel drew heavily from medieval theatrical traditions, architecture, and customs, which were seen as outdated and unsophisticated in comparison to the modern world. The fusion of these elements with the novel's format, which allowed readers a more personal glimpse into the characters' psychology, is what has allowed the Gothic genre to endure and maintain its relevance across time, becoming both obsolete and new to readers from different eras.\n\nOne of the central themes in Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry, which originated in the medieval era. The original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, retains and reinterprets this concept, elevating it to an idealized state. Chivalry represented the epitome of the noble knight: brave, honorable, and competent. Gothic writers, including Walpole, were drawn to this ideal and saw it as a benchmark for the present society, which they perceived as lacking. By employing chivalric concepts and mannerisms, the \"gothic past\" was romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic to Romanticism. This is exemplified in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, including being a prince, having suffered through tragedy, and being mistakenly believed to have been killed by infidels. Frederic's description is replete with traditional chivalric imagery, which is later exaggerated, introducing the trope of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the intricate process of moving goods from the initial customer order to the final stage of distribution, encompassing the raw materials, production, and delivery to the customer. This concept was first coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant who described the entire process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to satisfy customers' needs in a timely and efficient manner. At the heart of supply chain management are six fundamental elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. By mastering these elements, business managers can provide top-notch customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundation upon which the entire supply chain process is built. It involves determining the when, why, where, and how of production, including understanding customer demands. To grasp customer needs, managers examine market trends, which serve as the largest indicator of customer demands. Once market analysis is complete, managers decide what products to produce, in what quantities, and where to produce them, taking into account customer satisfaction and demand. Scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment are also crucial tasks at this stage. As I've witnessed firsthand in my past experience working at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores, having a well-defined process and layout is essential for smooth operations and prevents confusion and misdirection.\n\nSupply, the second key element, involves making strategic decisions about the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its unique equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must choose the most suitable division for each process or decide to outsource work to other companies to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. By streamlining operations through outsourcing, companies can reduce costs and maintain a competitive edge.",
            "I recently came across a disturbing message scrawled on a street corner in Burma, a country ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a violent coup. The sign held by Ellen Page, star of the critically acclaimed film Juno, reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma\", a haunting reference to the country's history of oppression and human rights abuses. Burma, also known as Myanmar, has been plagued by protests and violence, including the infamous \"Saffron Revolution\" of 2007, led by Buddhist monks who were met with brutal suppression by the military.\n\nThe situation in Burma is just one example of a long history of governments trying to silence dissent and maintain control over their citizens. Throughout history, rulers have claimed divine right to absolute power, from early Roman emperors to Japanese emperors who were believed to be gods. Even in modern times, some leaders have used their positions to silence critics and opponents. For instance, President George W. Bush has been known to consult with Ted Haggard, the head of a conservative Christian group, on a regular basis.\n\nThere have been numerous examples of brutal suppression of dissent throughout history. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where students and intellectuals demanded an end to authoritarian rule, resulted in a reported death toll of between 200 and 3,000 people. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militias and the government killed an estimated 800,000 people, is another extreme example of state-sponsored violence. The Nazi regime's systematic persecution and murder of Jews and other minority groups during World War II is a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and hatred.",
            "Duke Ellington left a lasting impact on jazz primarily due to his extended career and his exceptional ability to shape his orchestra. While his piano presence is subtle in many of the compositions featured in this assignment, as a composer Ellington excelled in crafting rich and complex pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. He developed the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing intricately orchestrated sections that highlighted the distinct styles of individual band members. By doing so, Ellington also emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra, creating cohesive and original sounds to suit each piece. His mastery of each player's sound and how they interacted within the growing ensemble allowed him to create some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative approach to sound and voice in his work, particularly in Creole Love Call, where he uses voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This early example demonstrates Ellington's ability to enhance texture and color without the restrictions of lyrics. Creole Love Call, a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece, features six distinct choruses that showcase Ellington's ability to complement the style of his soloists. The piece's structure is as follows:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response exchange between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth and melodic voice that transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this chorus, the voice takes on the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: A brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tone color to this piece is just one example of a stylistic trait that runs throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound by blending the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",

Three years later, at 17, she was still trying to make sense of it. She had come to the realization that she wanted someone rather than something, but nothing seemed to spark her interest in the guys around her. She often found herself pondering this strange phenomenon, trying to figure out what could be causing it. Theories had crossed her mind, but none of them seemed quite right.\n\nFor the most part, life at home was pretty laid-back. Her parents were easy-going and never argued with each other.

As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, she was startled by a faint scream from the kitchen and her mother's distressed voice. Her heart racing, she rushed into the room, asking \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother lying on the ground, wincing in pain. Her daughter quickly went to her side and put a supportive hand on her, trying to help. \"Ow... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother managed to say between deep breaths.

Her daughter was left sitting anxiously, waiting for news.\n\nIt turned out her mother had taken a tumble off a stepping stool while trying to grab a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between adhering to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality. The study found that a \"modified Med diet score\" (aMed score), which emphasizes the consumption of plant-based foods, healthy fats, and fish, is associated with a reduced risk of CHD and stroke. This modified Med diet is characterized by higher intake of fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, monounsaturated fats, and fish, and lower intake of animal products and saturated fats, with moderate alcohol consumption allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that a Med diet is linked to a lower risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and that it's more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, these studies didn't specifically examine the relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of heart disease or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated the aMed diet score using questionnaires that asked participants about their nutrient intake over the past year. Almost all participants continued to participate throughout the 20-year study period.\n\nThe researchers validated the accuracy of the questionnaires and confirmed reports of heart disease, stroke, and other health outcomes through medical records, hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were not available, the researchers classified the cases as \"probable,\" which accounted for about 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks.\n\nTo account for individual variations in diet and better represent long-term dietary habits, the researchers averaged the aMed scores from multiple questionnaires over time. They also adjusted for potential confounders, such as age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing a statistical model, the researchers found that a higher aMed score was associated with a lower risk of CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 cases of CHD, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths were reported. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a devastating economic downturn. High unemployment rates, a collapsing housing market, and the downfall of top corporations left many wondering how this financial disaster occurred and how it can be prevented. To put it simply, the crisis was born from reckless and uninformed political decisions that pressured banks and companies to issue sub-prime loans into a fragile financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were forced to take on and repackage these mortgages into complex financial instruments, only to see the entire economy suffer when borrowers defaulted on these loans. The chaos then spread to the repackaged mortgages and, ultimately, the rest of the economy.\n\nThe roots of this financial disaster date back to the late 1990s, during the Clinton administration. President Clinton sought to bolster his popularity by relaxing lending restrictions, which ultimately created the perfect storm for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. As reported by Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999, Fannie Mae, the country's largest mortgage underwriter, was under pressure from the administration to expand mortgage loans to low- and moderate-income individuals, while also meeting the expectations of its shareholders. Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As previously discussed, the reckless lending practices would inevitably lead to a catastrophic economic collapse.\n \nA combination of factors contributed to the economic downturn, one of which was the complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led U.S. households and financial markets to become heavily invested in the housing market, leaving them vulnerable to even slight price changes. \nWhen the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities were severely affected. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for about 30% of the country's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a low price, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were taken over by the government in September 2008.",
            "Ah, the infamous exposition - that section of your story where your writing skills are put to the test, leaving readers either in awe or nodding off in their chairs. Dr. Merlin has been known to frantically click the 'undo' button more than once when she finds herself drowning in a sea of unnecessary details. Exposition, it seems, is not exactly a welcome guest in the world of storytelling.\n\nAs writers, we've all been warned about the perils of \"telling, not showing,\" but Dr. Merlin still succumbs to lengthy descriptions of backstories, often leaving readers wondering when the real story will begin. Exposition is the pesky critic on your shoulder, urging you to provide context at the expense of actual plot progression. It's the voice that whispers, \"Get the history out of the way so we can get to the good stuff.\"\n\nIn fiction, exposition is when an author chooses to tell the reader what's happening, rather than show it through action, dialogue, or sensory details. In film, it's often manifested as a character dumping a wealth of information on another character, usually in a clunky and info-dumpy way. Think of it as a literary equivalent of a \"core dump\" a la \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"\n\nTake, for instance, a story where the protagonist's love interest is introduced with a grandiose passage detailing their entire history: where they met, how they married, and the tragic circumstances of their partner's demise. It's unlikely that this lengthy exposition would unfold over two pages, with the couple barely exchanging a few lines of dialogue. Instead, a skilled author would weave a more nuanced introduction, gradually revealing the husband's character through their speech, mannerisms, and interactions. This would not only make the reader invested in their fate but also provide valuable insight into the protagonist's personality, values, and motivations.\n\nBy adding depth and context to the bare-bones narrative, you create an emotionally resonant connection between the reader and the characters. In short, you'd expect the story to deliver more than just the skeletal outline: \"They met, they married, he died.\" A good writer knows that there's no substitute for rich, sensory details that breathe life into the narrative.\n\nSo, the next time you find yourself tempted to skim over the surface-level details, remember that a good story is built on more than just exposition. Provide the meat, not just the bones.",
            "I recently watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio, which left me thinking about the way news is presented. The first one I tuned into was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). They had a breaking story about a man in Ashley, Ohio, who stabbed his wife. The man's name was Shad Hostettler, and the news team devoted a reasonable two minutes to the developing story, stating that he had stabbed her multiple times and been arrested. I believe this was an adequate amount of coverage for the circumstances.\n\nThe second story that caught my attention was about an early morning shooting of an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and no arrests had been made at the time. The SWAT team was investigating the crime, but this story seemed to be glossed over. I've noticed a pattern where minorities are often underreported when they're victims of a crime. In contrast, when a white person is a victim, the media tends to go into overdrive, whereas if it's a minority person, they're lucky if it even gets mentioned.\n\nThe news team then moved on to a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They shared details about the location where the incident occurred and stated that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for tips that could lead to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe forecast for the weekend was also covered, with predictions of rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. Temperatures were expected to remain in the mid to low eighties, but the segment was a bit too brief and seemed like a teaser to keep viewers hooked.\n\nAnother story they ran with was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, approximately six feet tall, and weighing around 150 pounds. I found it striking that they spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing his skin color and how dark he was.\n\nLastly, they covered a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. What caught my attention was that instead of stating the sentence as 25 years in prison, they mentioned \"300 months,\" which seemed unnecessary and possibly an attempt to make the sentence sound harsher. Additionally, they mentioned that he was a Hispanic man, which I didn't think was particularly relevant to the story.",
            "In the intricate web of human relationships, the bond between brothers stands out as an unbreakable and complex connection. This unique tie is woven with various emotions - love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty - making it hard to unravel. Brothers have a deep understanding of each other that goes beyond the realm of ordinary relationships, and when they look at their brothers, they see a reflection of themselves. It's during intense moments that the true nature of their bond reveals itself, whether it's a beautiful or a destructive one. These emotions come with a cost, and dealing with their consequences is an integral part of understanding the bond. When one brother looks into another and sees their own reflection staring back, they gain insight into their own character through their actions and the repercussions that follow.\n\nIn James Hurst's \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is expertly explored, along with the cluster of emotions that come with it. Against the backdrop of a rich, vivid landscape, two brothers embark on a doomed journey, where bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in a heart-wrenching climax. Only one brother manages to escape alive. The theme is skillfully conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as the narrator's perspective, which highlights the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and their perception of the world around them. Both of these greatly influence their actions.\n\nAt the core of the protagonist's behavior lies a single, driving emotion: pride. From their initial outings together until their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother who could learn from him and share in his adventures, like \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp.\" He wanted a companion to join him in racing to Horsehead Landing and perching in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's fragile health made these dreams seem impossible. Born with a weak heart, Doodle's prospects for survival, let alone participating in physically demanding activities, were slim to none. The young protagonist's fantasies were shattered in an instant, leaving him with a deep sense of disappointment and frustration. He even grapples with anger towards his brother, as revealed by his recollection of contemplating suffocating him with a pillow. Yet, his heart softens when Doodle smiles at him, revealing a glimmer of hope. This moment showcases the protagonist's innate love for his brother, which he had likely been hiding beneath his pride and anger.",
            "The human brain is a complex and innovative system that processes information in a multitude of ways. Over the years, our understanding of the brain has advanced, and so have the metaphors used to describe it. Initially, we thought of the brain like a simple wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and more recently, a computer. However, it's essential to remember that these metaphors are limited and can lead to oversimplification and incorrect conclusions.\n\nThe process of information processing starts when our sensory organs transform physical stimuli, such as touch, heat, sound, or light, into electrical signals. This sensory information is then repeatedly processed by the brain using both bottom-up and top-down approaches. For instance, when looking at a black box on a white background, the brain's bottom-up processing puts together basic information like color, orientation, and object borders to identify the box. Top-down processing then speeds up recognition by using the decisions made during bottom-up processing. It might help you identify the object as a black box instead of a hole in the background.\n\nAs information is processed to a certain level, an attention filter decides its importance and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when looking down, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually, but you might pick out your name in a noisy room. There are various stages of processing, and the results are constantly modulated by attention.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information is encoded in various ways specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically, depending on its appearance, sound, or meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Research suggests that working memory, which stores information for around 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a series of neurons for a short period. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained through the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are various models describing how knowledge is organized in the brain, each based on different approaches like human memory retrieval, computer science, or neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts and that these nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For instance, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "In his thought-provoking novel, Brave New World, Aldous Huxley issues a stark warning about the dangers of unchecked technological advancements and the capitalistic systems that drive them. He creates a dystopian society where people value community over individuality and are conditioned to prioritize immediate gratification above all else. The citizens are mere pawns in a larger game, confined to a narrow ideology dictated by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can see Huxley's underlying concerns about the development of these systems, which eerily foreshadow the emerging economy of his time.\n\nHuxley uses Marxist concepts to satirize capitalism, highlighting the idea of false consciousness. In this context, the common citizenry is kept in the dark about their true relationships with other social classes, too focused on their own self-interest to grasp the bigger picture. This is achieved through the ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, as evident in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The lower classes, represented by Deltas and Gammas, are devoid of autonomy, with their drive to consume, spend, and indulge amplified through hypnopædia. The World Controller masterfully manipulates this desire, showcasing a clear example of hegemony, where a dominant group (the upper classes) exercises control over the others. The lower classes are oblivious to this manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that reinforces the existing social structure. Meanwhile, the upper classes, represented by Alphas and Betas, are aware of the manipulation but choose to accept their position, with few exceptions like Bernard.\n\nIn this world, meaningful relationships between individuals are non-existent. Characters are one-dimensional, lacking depth, which may suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism together rob people of their free will and emotional expression. Love and intense emotions are absent, replaced by superficial interactions, often reduced to shallow comments about physical appearance. The complacency of each social class within the hierarchy is a testament to the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where individuals are convinced of their superiority as long as they conform to the norms of their peers.",
            "As a student at University Park for over two and a half years now, I've experienced the challenges of navigating campus. For many of us, including myself, getting around campus can be a real issue. My freshman year, I was assigned to an East Halls dorm, which is situated on the far eastern edge of campus – excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. The commute from Stuart Hall, my hometown on campus, to classes in the Willard building, near the heart of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather is bad. I recently spoke to a fellow alumnus who's not much older than me, and they shared that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by vast tracts of unused land. Today, that empty space has been transformed into sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and the health services building, and surrounding apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. In my opinion, the best solution to this problem is the bicycle. However, having a bike is only half the battle – students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with the needs of bicyclists in mind.\n\nI had a conversation with a friend who recently took up bicycling again after a few-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped cycling in the first place. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is bicycling good for your physical health, but it's also the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more. As an off-campus resident, I'm just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was buying a bike. With my classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home, I can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only catch is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to navigate, whether I'm on a bike or on foot. While walking has its merits, I'm just too busy to do it. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class, and it would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That's over two and a half hours every week – time I just can't afford to spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I'm passionate about pursuing a career in social work, with a focus on helping children who have been abused or neglected, as well as supporting troubled families. Throughout my education, I've developed a set of core values that I believe are essential to this field: service, respect, an ethical nature, and a commitment to improving relationships and my own professional competence. These values are not just important to social workers, but also to me personally, as they reflect my own desires to help others and make a positive impact.\n\nAfter high school and college, I struggled to find a career path that aligned with my passions. Many people I met seemed to be avoiding their problems or using unhealthy coping mechanisms. Seeing this firsthand, I decided to pursue a degree in Psychology. Even after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted to do next. That all changed when I met a 16-year-old boy who was escaping his abusive parents. I drove to his parents' house with him and spoke with the police, expressing my concerns and sharing my background in Psychology. This experience opened my eyes to the need for social workers like me to help children like him.\n\nAnother value that drives me in social work is a commitment to social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuality, but often, we strive to conform to traditional norms. I'm proud to be an individual who refuses to be limited by what others expect of me. Throughout my high school and college years, I've actively protested against social injustice in my own way: expressing myself through fashion, speaking out against racism and discrimination, and advocating for the LGBTQ+ community through my involvement with GSBA. I believe in standing up for what's right and will continue to do so in my career as a social worker.\n\nI believe that my unique experiences, values, and commitment to social justice make me a strong candidate for a career in social work. I'm eager to make a difference in the lives of children and families in need, and I'm excited to start this journey.",
            "This paper explores the relationship between the Biological and Sociocultural models and insomnia, a complex sleep disorder. The biological model focuses on the genetic and medical factors that contribute to insomnia, while the Sociocultural model examines the environmental influences on sleep patterns, including demographics, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. This review examines the selected research studies related to these models, discusses their findings, and critiques their strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into three main groups: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders related to other mental health issues, or sleep disorders caused by medical complications or substance use. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias (difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep) and Parasomnias (behavioral or physiological sleep disorders). The Sociocultural models look at how environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status and ethnicity, impact sleep patterns.\n\nThe biological model focuses on the genetic and physiological aspects of sleep regulation. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that the activation of GABAA receptors on orexin neurons promotes sleep, while inhibition of these receptors can induce reduced anxiety and sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep time in mice, suggesting a potential genetic and environmental basis for sleep regulation in humans. This study has implications for understanding the biological basis of sleep disorders, including insomnia.\n\nFrom a Sociocultural perspective, if the phenotype of the GABAB receptor is inherited, it could regulate sleep patterns, and alterations to this receptor could naturally disrupt sleep. This could have significant impacts on daily life, including difficulties with concentration and focus. The Sociocultural model highlights the importance of considering environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status and ethnicity, in understanding insomnia.\n\nOverall, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Biological and Sociocultural models of insomnia, highlighting the complex interplay between genetic, physiological, and environmental factors that contribute to this complex sleep disorder.",
            "Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is a condition where the brain struggles to process and interpret auditory information. This doesn't mean that individuals with CAPD have a hearing problem or are unable to hear sounds. Instead, their brain's ability to distinguish between different sounds, identify patterns, and filter out background noise is impaired. As a result, people with CAPD may find it difficult to follow conversations, understand speech in noisy environments, or even make sense of auditory information they receive.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has been around for decades, dating back to the 1950s when researchers first described it as \"auditory imperception.\" Since then, studies have continued to evolve, with notable contributions from researchers such as Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, who developed tests for children with communicative disorders in the 1950s and 1960s. A national conference in 1977 helped stimulate research on CAPD in children, leading to a better understanding of the disorder.\n\nIndividuals with CAPD may exhibit a range of symptoms, including difficulty localizing sounds, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing patterns, and differentiating changes in speech. They may also struggle to filter out background noise, synthesize sound clues, and determine the sequence of auditory information. These challenges can impact daily life, making everyday tasks like following instructions or conversations more difficult.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive assessment, which may include observations of listening behavior, questionnaires, and standardized tests. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other specialists may use various measures to evaluate auditory-related skills. While there is no single test or tool that can diagnose CAPD with high accuracy, a combination of assessments can help identify the condition. These tests often present individuals with multiple auditory stimuli and ask them to differentiate between specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's response to these signals.",
            "The play Twelfth Night points out the risks of using deception as a means to achieve one's goals, particularly in a long-term sense. While disguise can be an effective tool for concealing one's true identity, it can ultimately lead to a loss of self if not abandoned. The problem with revealing a deception is that it can lead to feelings of alienation, as those who were deceived may struggle to reconcile their feelings and maintain relationships. This is especially true when it comes to deception in the form of gender role reversal, which raises questions about the motivations behind such actions. In Twelfth Night, Viola's decision to disguise herself as a man is driven by a desire for self-preservation. She feels the need to adopt a male persona in order to protect herself from potential harm, as evidenced by her statement: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\n\nThis deception, however, leads to Viola being disconnected from the women around her and creates a complicated web of relationships. Olivia, in particular, becomes infatuated with Viola in her disguise as Cesario, only to later shift her affections to Sebastian. This shift raises questions about Olivia's true feelings and whether they are genuine or a product of her societal expectations. The play may also suggest that deception can sometimes be a catalyst for revealing suppressed emotions, as seen in the relationships between Olivia, Orsino, and Viola/Cesario. Certain passages hint that these characters may have unexpressed desires that are brought to the surface by Viola's disguise. For instance, Olivia's ease in switching her affections from Cesario to Sebastian suggests that she may be more focused on social appearances than genuine emotional connections. Her eventual acceptance of Viola as her sister also implies that she may have been using her romantic feelings as a way to justify her societal expectations.",
            "When looking at the German colonial empire, it's clear that its approach to various territories was far from uniform. The brutal treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa is a stark example of this. However, it's essential to understand that the German colonial empire was a complex entity with diverse policies and ruling styles across its vast territories. Even education systems varied significantly from one colony to another.\n\nWhen the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found a well-educated and literate African population. In contrast, German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. But the situation in South West Africa, now known as Namibia, presented a stark contrast. Unlike in East Africa, where the government invested heavily in the education of local populations, in South West Africa, the task of educating the native population was largely left to missionary societies with limited government support. While the government invested in schools for Europeans and supported missionary schools, the majority of the African population remained uneducated and illiterate. This disparity had long-lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this divergence, and this paper aims to explore these factors in more detail. It will examine the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans and draw on new research to shed light on this complex issue.\n\nThe literature on education in the German colonial empire is extensive, with many studies focusing on specific colonies and systems. Early works, mainly written in German, aimed to describe the features of these educational systems. Later studies, written in English, provided more in-depth comparative analyses of education in the various German colonies. One notable study is Cohen's comparison of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which highlights the differences between the two colonies. According to Cohen, the large settler population in South West Africa played a significant role in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa's relatively temperate climate attracted a sizable European population. By 1913, over 15,000 whites lived in the colony, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population. These demographic differences had a profound impact on the educational systems of the two colonies, leading to the stark contrast between them.",
            "Heavy metal music has evolved significantly since its inception over 100 years ago, and the constant branching out into sub and sub-sub genres has made it challenging to define the entire realm of popular music. Many genres, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, have also spawned various sub-genres within their domains. One of the most expressive and diverse genres that has emerged over the past 40 years is Heavy Metal rock, which is characterized by its wide range of emotions, predominantly darker ones. This diversity is a result of its adaptability, allowing artists to create their own sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, which has led to a proliferation of niches and themes.\n\nIt's now difficult to pinpoint the exact definition of heavy metal, as it has incorporated elements from other genres and has branched out into numerous sub-niches. To truly understand the various types of metal music that exist today, it's essential to grasp the essence of the metal movement and its significance as a distinct entity.\n\nAt its core, heavy metal is a movement defined by its darker aspects, which can be seen as a \"music of more\" - more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. Metal musicians often possess impressive technical skills, which are evident in their music. The genre has also been heavily influenced by psychedelic drugs, particularly in the mid-70s, which led to the creation of crazy and otherworldly records. The movement has taken on many dark and visceral qualities, which were relatively new to the music scene at the time. Later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the darker aspects of the Romantic Era, resulting in lyrics that reflect the genre's darker side, such as those found in the song Helter Skelter by the Beatles.\n\nThese lyrics showcase the Beatles' exploration of the darker side, which some consider to be one of the first heavy metal songs. It was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker song, and the Beatles aimed to prove that they could match the Stones' intensity. This song was featured on The White Album, demonstrating its significance in the evolution of heavy metal music.",
            "Before the Surrealist movement took off, Henri Rousseau was already crafting his own unique works, literally and figuratively. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is more than just a representation of a woman in awe of her surroundings - it's also a reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations and internal struggles as an artist. For years, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise from other artists and art lovers, but this goal came with a challenge: conform to the art world's expectations or forge his own path.\n\nTo understand The Dream, you need to know a bit about Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, he came from a family of modest means, with his father being a tinsmith and hardware dealer. Despite never receiving formal art training, Rousseau worked as a gabelou (municipal toll service employee) until age 40, earning the nickname douanier (customs inspector) along the way. After his wife Clémence's passing, which was followed by the loss of eight infant children, Rousseau was left with one child and a deep sense of grief. He turned to painting as a way to escape his sorrow and start anew.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized and sentimentalized the peasant experience in their artwork, Rousseau was a folk painter who drew from his own life and hopes. His desire for acceptance in the art world is understandable, given that he was self-taught and began his career at an older age, competing with talented and well-known modern artists like Matisse. As Jan Gordon notes in his book Modern French Painters, while Matisse feared painting trite works, Rousseau aimed to create conventional art that would earn him a spot among the Artiste Français.\n\nThe Dream is a testament to Rousseau's internal struggle to balance his desire for recognition with his need for creative independence. By examining his life and artistic journey, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities behind this iconic painting.",
            "Many thinkers have pondered the connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe there's a fundamental reason for this relationship. As John Keats writes in his famous \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While our knowledge of life often stems from education or experience, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics without being formally taught these concepts. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than prescribe; they attempt to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nWhat's most noteworthy is that criticism of art or morals can't fully capture the essence of what's good or beautiful. When discussing the worth of a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa, we might focus on aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these elements don't truly convey why it's a great work of art. When asked about a favorite piece of art or literature, people often respond with phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a more in-depth analysis. I believe that both art and morals can't be reduced to a simple description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor said, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe the properties of a work of literature, there's still something intangible left. Ethics, much like art, possesses this transcendental quality, which provides a connection between the two.\n\nI propose that morality and art are closely linked because we experience both at a fundamental, noumenal level. They impact us in ways that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is particularly strong when it comes to literature, as it's an art form that inherently carries moral weight. As McKean noted, \"What distinguishes literature from other arts is its moral quality. While moral standards may not be relevant to other arts like music, they seem to be as applicable to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The modern Germany is a robust nation, boasting a unique cultural identity shaped by its history, from the sun-kissed Alps in Munich to the Baltic coast in Kiel. A similar cultural thread runs through the Rhine River city of Cologne, through the heart of Germany to the picturesque city of Dresden on the Elbe River. Given this rich cultural tapestry, it's no surprise that Germany's present identity is the result of a diverse blend of influences from various tribes and cultures.\n\nThe origins of the name \"Germany\" are shrouded in mystery, with scholars and historians debating its etymology. According to historical accounts, the name may have originated from the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe that crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gauls. The Roman historian Tacitus, writing in the 1st century AD, attributed the name to this tribe. Conversely, Julius Caesar claimed to have borrowed the term \"Germanus\" from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes they had yet to defeat. While the true origin of the name remains uncertain, some propose that it refers to the Gaulish word for \"neighbor\" or perhaps the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" highlighting the Germans' reputation for being loud and boisterous.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote extensively on the origins of the Germans in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum.\" He described the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by immigration or external influences, and noted that the harsh climate, unforgiving terrain, and rugged culture of Germany would be an unlikely destination for outsiders. The Romans, despite their conquests, rarely settled in Germany, preferring to trade with the Germanic tribes and recruit them into their military ranks rather than establishing a permanent presence.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged in the 1st century AD, they inhabited the fringes of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and skills with the Romans. Their interactions with the empire laid the groundwork for the complex cultural identity that defines modern Germany, a nation born from the confluence of diverse influences and experiences.",
            "As I stood there, my mind went blank, and I stared at the unremarkable scene in front of me. My thoughts drifted in and out of my consciousness like wisps of smoke, never quite landing or sticking. It was a sensation I'd grown accustomed to, a practiced numbness that allowed me to observe without truly engaging. The image before me was a jumbled mess of details, and yet, it was as if I had no thoughts of my own, just a smooth, liquid experience of the present moment.\n\nI'd always wanted to learn how to draw, ever since I was a child. So, on the advice of an artist I'd worked with, I picked up a copy of The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. The book promised to teach me the fundamental principles of art, from understanding the basics of a pencil to the mental processes that govern our perception of lines. One technique stuck with me – framing a picture with a simple square, breaking down a complex scene into a manageable form.\n\nAt that moment, however, I was too overwhelmed to apply that technique. The scene before me was too rich, too detailed, and I felt like I was drinking from a firehose. I was a blank slate, staring at the unremarkable bowl of brown matter in front of me, trying to make sense of it all. It was as if I was standing at the beginning of a journey, the start of my own artistic journey, and I felt the weight of that responsibility.\n\nMy hand, however, was eager to create. My fingers flexed, and my hand hovered over the toilet handle, poised to take action. But instead of drawing or painting, I ended up smacking the handle again, trying to dislodge the stubborn, brown package that refused to budge. I stood there, fuming, my green tie feeling like a noose around my neck. I was a janitor at Rite Aid, and it seemed like no one appreciated the art I brought to my work – the delicate dance of soap and water, the soothing sound of a toilet flushing.\n\nAs I stood there, one last time, I gripped the toilet paper roll, my hand molding itself into a makeshift mitt. Then, with a deep breath, I reached in, my hand dipping slowly into the bowl like a mother carefully placing a turkey in the oven. It was a mundane task, but in that moment, it felt like a work of art, a moment of creative expression in an otherwise dull, ordinary life.",
            "Each year, a disturbing number of teenagers lose their lives on the roads.  Several factors contribute to this alarming trend.  The National Institutes of Health point out that the teen brain simply isn't yet equipped to handle the dangers of driving.  Additionally, the lack of driving experience is a major contributor to the problem.  This inexperience not only results in a higher rate of fatal accidents, but also an increased likelihood of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nTeens also tend to fare poorly when driving with their peers, a fact that's hardly surprising given how often they do it.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center found a clear correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents that occur.  In an effort to improve teen safety, some states have implemented provisional driver's licenses that limit the hours teens can drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\nHowever, I believe that provisional licenses are merely a temporary fix.  The real issue is that, as a group, young drivers are simply not equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving.  According to psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, even 18 is too young for a regular driver's license.  His research suggests that those under the age of 19 or 20 often have a strong desire to take risks for the thrill of it.  It makes sense, then, to delay driving until this tendency has begun to subside.  If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, we can expect to see even more deadly accidents and a staggering death toll in the years to come.  By 2010, the Baby Boomers' children will be eligible to drive, and millions of new teen drivers will be hitting the road.\n\nLegislation addressing this issue would be relatively straightforward.  Schools could continue to offer driver's education classes to prepare future drivers, but no one under 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full license, and a set number of practical driver's training hours would still be required.  The specific number of hours could be based on the requirements of the majority of states, such as the 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult currently required in California.  Uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country.  This idea is certainly not new.",
            "While browsing through the vast collection of early Edison films at the Library of Congress, I decided to take a closer look at the 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films often employ creative editing techniques to create illusions that captivate the viewer. My film analysis focused primarily on dissecting the poetics behind the majority of trick films and examining the unique characteristics present in a few of the later films that dared to break the mold. For the most part, trick films from the turn of the century are confined to a set-bound format, adhering to a strict one shot = one film methodology, featuring stationary cameras, long shots, and medium shots.\n\nHowever, a few films from the early 20th century began to challenge these conventions by introducing innovative elements such as multiple shots. One of the most notable similarities among trick films is their use of an interior set within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary, never moving to follow figures or objects. This composition drew inspiration from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations of this style is that figures in trick films tend to move side-to-side, rather than towards or away from the camera. For instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, never venturing beyond the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also results in a predominantly use of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-up shots are notably absent in all the trick films from the Edison catalog. This convention is a nod to the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would witness the entire performance at any given time, framed within the borders of the stage. In early films, actors rarely move from the middle ground towards the camera, making close-ups a rarity.\n\nMost early trick films follow the pattern where one conceptual shot equals one film, limiting their length to approximately a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. This restriction also constrains the narrative or dramatic usage of trick films, which typically focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and switching antics with minimal storylines. Interestingly, however, a single \"shot\" in a trick film can actually comprise several joined shots to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. For example, in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), a closer inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a strong advocate for Republicanism, driven by his passion for agriculture and his brief stint in politics. As a result, he developed a reputation for being fiercely dedicated and outspoken on matters of personal freedom and government. His commitment to an agrarian-based system influenced his views on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system. He believed that preserving and promoting this ideal form of work was crucial in shaping his opinions on governance.\n\nIn Taylor's opinion, the United States had a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system of self-government, unencumbered by native traditions. He firmly believed in the natural rights of individuals, which he argued were interconnected, and that denying one right would compromise the value of the remaining rights. Consequently, he believed that these rights should be beyond the reach of the government. He saw the concept of the \"state of nature\" as a reality where the strong and cunning profited, but in a civilized society, this was not acceptable.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be designed to account for the inherent good and evil within humanity. He was resolute in his dualistic morality, stating that as government is exercised by humans, it will reflect both virtues and vices. He defined good principles as those that protect private property, improve agriculture, and discourage capitalism, which he believed would lead to a government that functioned equitably, regardless of its administration. However, self-interest, which he saw as a fundamental human motivation, was only considered evil when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.\n\nTaylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, seeking an extremely limited Federal government with no more rights or powers than those explicitly stated in the document. He recognized that an extensive Federal government would be expensive and potentially tyrannical. However, he also believed that a simple, literal interpretation was inadequate, as it could lead to corruption without considering the intent of the founders. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking at the data shown in Figure 17, it's clear that there was a significant drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. At first glance, this was a bit of a letdown, and it's tough to pinpoint the reason behind it. With the onset of winter on a New England campus, it's likely that the decrease in bike and foot traffic played a part in the decline. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a time when students are busy wrapping up schoolwork and dealing with final exams, which might have caused the commuter log to fall off many people's radar. The holiday season also kicked in during this time, followed by a month-long break for students and faculty, which probably contributed to the low numbers. Even when classes resumed in late January, submissions remained low, raising the question of whether this was a temporary lull or a sign of a more permanent drop in engagement. One possibility is that any project of this nature tends to have an initial surge of enthusiasm, followed by a gradual decline. To combat this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign aimed at reviving the initiative, which successfully resulted in an uptick in log submissions for that month. However, this still left us wondering how to maintain momentum in the face of the inevitable dip in engagement that occurs when students and faculty are on break. \n\nAnother challenge that came up during this project (and one that's likely to arise in any alternative commuting initiative) is the fact that driving a car gives people a sense of freedom and independence that's deeply ingrained in our culture. To overcome this, we offered incentives in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, and other establishments. It would have been interesting to see how bigger prizes, such as a new bike or a hybrid/electric car, might have impacted participation. Perhaps if we had announced these larger prizes in December and January, that might have helped to mitigate the dip in engagement that we experienced. The value of the prizes didn't change over the course of the project, but if we had upped the ante, it's possible that participation would have remained strong rather than dipping.",
            "In the world of investing, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have gained popularity due to their unique combination of characteristics - flexibility, diversification, and low expense ratios. An ETF is essentially a security that tracks an index, commodity, or a basket of assets, similar to an index fund, but trades on an exchange like a stock. This enables investors to reap the benefits of single stock ownership, such as short-selling, buying on margin, and purchasing as few as one share in a transaction. Furthermore, ETFs offer a wider variety of funds to choose from, making it easier for investors to find the right fit for their investment goals.\n\nHowever, as with any investment, there are some downsides to consider. For instance, ETFs come with a commission on trades, similar to buying or selling stocks. Despite these minor drawbacks, the benefits of ETFs are undeniable. In this analysis, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it to its top 10 holdings to determine whether owning a single ETF is equivalent to a diversified portfolio of the individual stocks. We will also investigate whether a reconfigured portfolio of the same stocks could provide a better return and lower beta.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, we have chosen to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below is a list of the top 10 holdings and their corresponding percentage of total assets.\n\nTo gauge the effectiveness of these 10 stocks in representing the ETF as a whole, we will calculate their contributions to a portfolio's beta and return if the portfolio were made up entirely of these stocks in the proportions determined by the ETF's holdings. The calculations are included in the chart below.\n\nThe chart clearly shows that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF. Based on these results, it appears that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta. Nevertheless, it's essential to verify whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo determine this, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "It's interesting to note that Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" one of his standout poems. In this poem, Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, which is a reference to a mysterious island located north of Britain, viewed by the Greeks as the edge of the world. However, Virgil is not the only source for this term, as some scholars suggest that Poe may have been influenced by German literature. Poe was indeed a fan of German authors, including Goethe. \n\nIn fact, a closer look at Goethe's work \"Faust\" reveals a poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king who is heartbroken after his wife's passing, and he turns to excessive drinking. The poem's themes of loss and despair are eerily similar to those found in \"Dream-Land.\" It's possible that Poe was paying homage to Goethe's work, as scholar Karl J. Arndt notes in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon.\" Furthermore, Goethe's \"Faust\" was a celebrated work of poetic drama, published in two parts in 1808 and 1832, respectively. The parallels between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are striking, with both works exploring themes of loss, grief, and the human condition.\n\nPoe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in his collected writings is notable, with references in both \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land.\" The two poems can be seen as companion pieces, with \"The King of Thulé\" serving as a dark reflection of the themes found in \"Dream-Land.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape, haunted by the memories of loved ones, while in \"The King of Thulé,\" Goethe's king is similarly consumed by grief after the loss of his wife.\n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Tennyson and his familiarity with German literature, it's likely that he would have been aware of Goethe's work. In fact, Poe's respect for Tennyson suggests that he would have been exposed to Goethe's writings through various reproductions and translations that were popular at the time.",
            "In a recent court case, a woman named Jennifer Palmer is suing D&D Markets for punitive damages after she slipped and fell on an applesauce spill at the store. The store manager, Paul Martin, was informed about the spill not once, but twice, and chose to ignore it for 30 minutes because he was eating dinner. The question is whether Martin's actions were malicious enough to warrant punitive damages under California law. \n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Palmer's claim outright. To win punitive damages, she'll need to show that Martin's actions were done with a reckless disregard for the harm they would cause. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known about the dangers of leaving a spill unattended, given that several customers had slipped and fallen due to similar incidents at the store in the past. However, it's less clear whether Martin's actions were truly malicious, given that he had been warned twice about the spill. Still, Palmer has a strong argument that Martin failed to act with the necessary care to ensure customer safety, especially given the six slip-and-fall incidents at the store in 2009.\n\nAccording to court records, on October 13, 2009, two employees, Rich Wayne and Mary J. Haddigan, separately informed Martin about the applesauce spill, but he dismissed their concerns, saying he was busy eating dinner. Thirty minutes later, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, severely injuring her back. Prior to her accident, five other customers had reported slipping and falling at the store that year.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The law defines malice as conduct that was intended to cause harm or was done with a \"despicable\" disregard for others' safety. The court has ruled that conduct is malicious when the defendant is aware of the likely harm their actions will cause and deliberately chooses to ignore it. In this case, Palmer may have a strong case for punitive damages, but it will ultimately depend on how the court interprets Martin's actions and intentions.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took an Islam course at CBC, and one topic continues to fascinate me to this day: whether Islam is inherently a hostile religion. In my opinion, this question is more relevant now than ever, especially considering the shift in media portrayals of Islam and its adherents since 9/11. It's intriguing to think about the possibility of a presidential candidate with a strong Muslim background, like Barack Obama, running for office in 2001. \n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad has always piqued my interest. The more I learn about Muhammad's life, the more I'm struck by the contrast between the historical figure and the depiction in his biography. I previously believed that Muhammad forced conversions to Islam, conquering tribes and imposing his religion on them. However, the biography presents a different narrative – one of a humble and self-effacing figure who was misunderstood and humbled himself to others. It was only after people witnessed his teachings that they came to see the truth in them. \n\nWhat's even more striking is the similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad. For instance, the story of multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men is a notable example. The way this story is told makes me think that the authors wanted Muhammad to be seen as a prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and performed miracles. This approach, however, undermines the significance of Jesus' life and teachings. It's as if they're attempting to steal and co-opt the essence of Jesus' message through Muhammad. \n\nAnother aspect of the biography that raises questions is the way it presents stories of people converting to Islam. While the authors aim to demonstrate the truth of these stories, the fact that they're often based on second-hand accounts from multiple people makes me skeptical. I think this approach diminishes the impact of the stories and makes them seem suspicious. \n\nWhat bothers me most is the way the biography portrays Muhammad as a godly, humble, wise, and gentle man. However, historical accounts contradict this image, and I'm left wondering if modern Muslims are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The core teachings of Jesus and the original beliefs he held during his lifetime were quickly abandoned as Christianity evolved after his passing.  If we look at this historical trend in broad strokes, it appears that Christianity has been moving further and further away from its roots over time.  However, there is an increasing awareness and a progressive movement in today's world that could potentially alter this trajectory.  While traditionalists may resist any ideas that diverge from their established beliefs, they might not be influential enough to dictate the future of the faith.  As time progresses, Christians will increasingly become aware of the history of their faith and crave a closer understanding of the original intentions of Jesus' teachings.  It may take several decades or even centuries, but it's inevitable that we will see a major shift in the course of Christian history, resulting in a return to the faith's original form.  A movement will emerge that will systematically peel away the layers of doctrine that have been added over time, effectively reversing the clock and returning to the core principles that Jesus introduced to humanity in the name of God.  When this trend gains momentum in the United States and Europe, it will spread across the masses, prompting a return to the simplicity of following Jesus' ideas as they were intended, rather than the complex interpretations that have developed over time.  The church will continue to serve as a guiding institution, but its influence will be characterized by a growing uniformity of belief and practice.  Rather than differences between regions, denominations, and divisions, we can expect to see increasing similarities.  History has shown us that great reversals can occur, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor of Christians to a Christian institution.  Similarly, our nation has progressed from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The impending reversal in the Christian faith will be a significant event that will undo the accumulated complexities of history and seek out the faith's original source, resulting in a unification of the diverse branches of Christianity.  A crucial factor in making this process possible will be the shift from interpreting Jesus' words as literal statements to understanding them as metaphors.  So what led to the transformation of Christianity over time?\n\nLooking back into history, we find that the seeds of the Christian faith were planted in Judaism, the theological foundation of the Christian religion.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the core elements of monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were already in place.  However, the Jewish population was not a unified entity, with various groups, such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people, each with their own distinct spirit and perspective.",
            "I firmly believe that The Jungle portrays the darker aspects of human nature, exposing people's inherent selfishness and self-centeredness. Deep down, many individuals are primarily concerned with their own well-being and success, often disregarding the needs and welfare of those around them. The novel masterfully illustrates this concept through the actions of the factory owners and managers. Their sole focus is on expanding their businesses and increasing their wealth, without any regard for the consequences or harm caused to others. As Upton Sinclair so vividly describes, the factory's towering structures and smoke-belching chimneys symbolize the devastating impact of their greed. The pollution and unsanitary conditions surrounding Packingtown are a stark reminder of the owners' disregard for human and animal life.\n\nMoreover, the owners and managers showed a blatant disregard for their employees, whom they exploited for their own gain. They would stop at nothing to save a buck, even if it meant subjecting their workers to inhumane conditions and long working hours. The novel starkly highlights the lack of empathy and decency in the workplace, where a worker's value was measured solely by their productivity, not their human worth. The absence of labor regulations and worker protections during that era allowed the factory owners to operate with impunity, forcing their employees to endure grueling conditions and live in squalor. Although the novel doesn't explicitly state it, the workers who toiled and suffered in Packingtown were essentially treated like slaves, with no access to resources, information, or support. Even the unions that formed to protect workers often ended up taking advantage of them, further exacerbating their struggles.\n\nThe novel paints a grim picture of a system where workers were trapped, with no escape from the cruel and unforgiving world of Packingtown. As Sinclair so eloquently puts it, the consequences of this system were as inevitable and widespread as those under chattel slavery.",
            "When authors write novels, they often use various techniques to evoke certain feelings or attitudes from their readers. These techniques can be quite effective, and F. Scott Fitzgerald is no exception. In his iconic novel The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald employs several of these techniques to shape the reader's perception of key subjects. One of these techniques is pairing an adjective and a noun in a way that doesn't typically mesh, to create an unexpected aura around the subject. Another technique is assigning meaning to a symbol, only to reuse it for the same purpose later on. Fitzgerald frequently uses the latter technique with colors, including gold, green, white, and various shades of pink and red. In The Great Gatsby, he gradually builds up connotations for certain colors, particularly white and gray, before utilizing them to convey a specific emotion or feeling associated with a pivotal object.\n\nFitzgerald develops the meaning of white and gray in the beginning of the novel, implying uniformity and a sense of sameness. White is portrayed as somewhat upscale and refined, while gray is depicted as more aged and faded. He initially establishes this meaning by consistently using these colors throughout the novel. For example, Daisy and Jordan are often seen wearing white, and even other characters like Nick wear white attire to Gatsby's parties. However, when Nick describes the party, he notes the use of \"primary colors,\" which stands out from the predominantly white-and-gray aesthetic. Fitzgerald further reinforces this meaning by using these colors to describe mundane, unremarkable subjects, such as Nick's commute to work or the apartment buildings in the city. He also applies these colors to ordinary people or places, like Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood\" or the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes.\n\nAfter establishing the meaning of white and gray, Fitzgerald uses them to signify a lack of importance or uniformity in various subjects, starting with Daisy. After a period of relative scarcity of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as dressed in white in a \"little white roadster,\" giving readers the impression that she is not a fully fleshed-out character, but rather a uniform, something that Gatsby desires but cannot attain. Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly to give the impression of Daisy as a more uniform, unremarkable figure, such as when he describes a \"gray haze\" around her fur collar or her wearing a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County boasts an incredibly productive agricultural sector, thanks to its pleasant, sunny climate. The region grows a wide variety of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. Interestingly, there's a significant demand for locally produced, organic community-supported agriculture food in the area, with numerous organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many of these farms offer tours of their agricultural operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. By adopting organic farming practices, landowners can benefit from government programs while also protecting and enhancing local habitats, thus allowing for recreational use and educational opportunities.\n\nWhile organic farming offers many benefits, including greater biodiversity due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water, it often comes with higher costs. Organic farming requires more labor and management to control pests and weeds, fertilize the soil without chemicals, and mitigate losses, which can be greater than those experienced with conventional methods. Additionally, small organic farms are often less efficient than larger operations and may face higher labor costs for practices that benefit wildlife, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species control, and managing plant growth to create specific conditions like edge habitats or open patches of ground.\n\nThe proposed land for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. The land features a mix of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered or declining. These species include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The parcel was part of an original homestead patent, suggesting it was used for grazing and/or wood production for many years.\n\nI selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched government programs to determine the options available to a small farmer seeking to mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what someone farming this land might attempt to achieve, I drew inspiration from an organic farm in the same area.",
            "In any negotiation, understanding the role of culture is vital. However, culture is not a fixed entity that can be easily defined or stereotyped. It's more often a complex tapestry of nuances, where what culture is not can be just as telling as what it actually is. Broad statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify the richness of a culture. Instead, a negotiator should focus on grasping the significance of a culture in the context of the negotiation, and how it will impact the discussion at hand.\n\nWhen engaging with a foreign culture, we inevitably draw parallels to our own, often leading to misunderstandings. To navigate these differences, one must not only study a culture's history and prejudices but also be willing to accept it for what it is, rather than judging or trying to change it. This acceptance is especially crucial when dealing with a weaker bargaining position or negotiating in a foreign territory. Demonstrating respect for a culture's traditions and beliefs can be a powerful tool in bridging cultural divides and moving the negotiation forward.\n\nCulture is not limited to national or international boundaries. Companies within a nation often develop their own unique corporate culture, characterized by distinct values, communication styles, and hiring practices. For instance, some companies prioritize long work hours, while others encourage a more relaxed schedule. Employee dress codes, communication styles, and philanthropic efforts can all reveal the underlying corporate culture. Even within the same nation, different companies and regions can exhibit vastly different corporate cultures.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's values is equally crucial, as they provide the underlying motivations and driving forces. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator is unlikely to publicly embarrass their company or superior. On the other hand, a culture that places a high value on a hard-driven bargain may not be inclined to settle quickly. By considering these cultural nuances before the negotiation, a negotiator can gain a crucial edge. However, it's equally important to learn about the personal dynamics of the opposing party, as this can be the key to a successful negotiation.",
            "It's often said, \"There is no God,\" but this phrase is something that both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas strongly disagree with, as seen in their respective writings on the existence of God. Both of these thinkers present arguments in defense of the same concept of God, so in order to compare their theories, we'll assume they're correct in their belief in the God of the Bible. After all, comparing their arguments to a God figure that doesn't resemble the one they're defending wouldn't allow for a fair comparison.\n\nWhen looking at their arguments, it's clear that neither of them provides a complete basis for believing in God. One of the main issues with their arguments is that they both miss the bigger picture. I think this point can be best understood by examining the basic arguments of each author in more detail.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument is based on the idea that we can find proof of God's existence within our own minds. He suggests that because we can't effectively conceive God's nonexistence, it's clear that he exists. While this idea may be a bit confusing at times, the basic gist is that the proof for God lies within our own understanding. This idea is often referred to as faith within Christian texts, and it's based on the idea that we don't need external evidence to prove the existence of God - just our own knowledge.\n\nOn the other hand, St. Thomas Aquinas has a very different approach. He believes that we can prove God's existence using reason and empirical evidence alone, with no need for faith. This idea would be useful in spreading the message of Christianity because it would allow new converts to be convinced through logic rather than faith. Aquinas presents five different logical arguments to support the existence of God, which include change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Essentially, he argues that the existence of God is a logical necessity - if you're missing one puzzle piece, you can still understand its features and existence without actually seeing it.",
            "In the early days of recorded history, a prince was born, who would one day be known as the Buddha. As time passed, he abandoned his royal life and embarked on a spiritual journey that led to his enlightenment. His teachings eventually gave rise to Buddhism, with the Theravada sect being one of its most traditional forms. This ancient faith is over 2,500 years old, and it's undergone significant changes since the Buddha's time. For instance, in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, the annual water-cutting ceremony is an event that's deeply rooted in tradition, although the Buddha never mentioned it. This illustrates the extent to which the religion has evolved over time, from its superficial customs to its fundamental principles. As a result, the Theravada Buddhist community has had to adapt its doctrine in response to both internal and external influences, some of which have been hostile and others benevolent.\n\nThroughout this discussion, we'll be using certain key terms. An internal force is defined as a factor that arises from within the Buddhist community, regardless of whether its members are monks or laypeople. In contrast, an external force refers to any influence from outside the Buddhist community. A hostile force is any force that harms or seeks to damage the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of the faith. On the other hand, a benign force is one that doesn't aim to harm or help the community, but may inadvertently have either effect.\n\nTo begin with, it's essential to understand the core principles of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, which is comprised of three baskets of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka provides the metaphysical framework of Buddhism. This framework includes concepts such as Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of everything). Only by recognizing these concepts can one break free from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which continues endlessly. Along with Sansara, one's attachment to lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) will also cease when one becomes enlightened. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for laymen and monks alike, with five precepts for laymen (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances) and a more detailed set of disciplinary rules for monks. The most fundamental concept in Buddhism is the four noble truths: Dukkha, the truth that life is suffering; the attachment that causes suffering; the possibility of overcoming suffering; and the path to achieve that liberation.",
            "The rivalry between the United States and Mexico is a prime example of a longstanding feud that spanned an impressive 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The peak of this animosity was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the U.S. gained the upper hand and claimed Texas and the Southwest as its own territory. The tension between the two nations was fueled by numerous clashes, which eventually subsided just before the outbreak of World War I. The initial spark of this rivalry emerged from fundamental differences in their values, customs, and faith, along with significant disparities in their material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). \n\nThis type of long-standing rivalry is not unique to the U.S. and Mexico; many nations bordering their neighbors often develop opposing interests, contributing to the formation of deep-seated rivalries. The U.S. and Mexico are not alone in their historical tensions with their neighboring countries; David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that Mexico and Cuba are the only two nations that have consistently posed significant diplomatic problems for the U.S. (p. 41). Both of these countries are geographically close to the U.S. and have historically vied for its attention, whereas many other Latin American nations have maintained more positive relationships with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in the rift between the two nations, a common thread in the history of various international conflicts. Sally Frahm (2001) points out that, \"if Americans opposed fascism and communism in the 20th century, they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries\" (p. 86). In a similar vein, the ideological struggle between the U.S. and the Soviet Union during the Cold War was, in part, a clash over core values and vital interests. In the case of the U.S. and Mexico, however, the underlying conflict was rooted in their differing religious preferences, inherited from their colonial past. This inherent distrust was a major obstacle to establishing friendly diplomatic relations between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. during the 57-year rivalry period. The majority of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems. The problem of bandits and outlaws from American border towns further exacerbated tensions until both nations deployed military force along their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nThe rivalry between the two nations began to subside as \"Mexico became increasingly reliant on the United States\" (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109) and eventually ended as U.S. ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico in the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, my life took an unexpected turn when I suddenly fell ill with an illness I was previously unaware of. At the time, I was working as a nurse, a profession I had chosen for the stability and security it offered, especially given my tumultuous childhood. The constant reassurance was that \"you'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\" Thus, even though my true aspirations lay in science and journalism, I pursued nursing. \n\nHowever, fate had other plans. At 46, I was left with little savings, unable to work, and facing a future shrouded in uncertainty. Fifteen years of living off social security disability have left me with nothing to call my own. Each day is a struggle, a constant battle for security, safety, and self-esteem. Yet, amidst the chaos, one truth remains: I couldn't have navigated these difficult years without the unwavering support of my family and a handful of loyal friends. In times of true crisis, one's strength is often an illusion. \n\nMy point is that life is unpredictable, and emergencies can strike at any moment, big or small. No matter how well-prepared one is, some challenges are too great to overcome alone. \n\nWhile I agree that the US needs to rethink its reliance on a faltering government, I firmly believe that a more effective solution lies in fostering a culture of mutual support and help among Americans. Rather than relying solely on the government, we should encourage people to trust and rely on one another. This approach would be a more effective safeguard against life's uncertainties. \n\nThe notion of rugged individualism, often touted by American conservatives, is often romanticized. However, the true secret to the success of our forefathers was not their isolation but their compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast alone; they relied on each other for survival. \n\nSo, by all means, be prepared. I have my own disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and other essentials. If you have the means, consider starting a small farm or acquiring a wood stove. But while you're at it, take the time to get to know your neighbors. Building a community that looks out for one another is the most effective way to navigate life's uncertainties.",
            "Evolutionary changes in organisms have long been a subject of interest and debate among scientists. One question that has puzzled researchers for years is what drives the direction of evolutionary change. It's surprising that even today, despite the significant progress made in understanding organic forms, defining them in mathematical terms remains a daunting task. However, recent studies have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk development, both during their growth and throughout their evolutionary history (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our current research aims to explore how mathematical modeling, combined with experimental studies, can help explain the mechanisms behind the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum. \n\nTo achieve this, we employed X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify key parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were then input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). By using these parameters, we created hypothetical shell morphologies that can help us understand the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. The results of our study are being integrated with experimental and descriptive research to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nConsidering a shell as a tube that moves through 360 degrees of space over time, we can break it down into distinct components. The revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis, known as the columella, runs through the central column of the shell. The speed at which the whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line separating each whorl is called a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last one, known as the body whorl. The spire consists of all the whorls except the last, while the apex is the tip of the spire and the base is the opposite end. The animal emerges from its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nStudying shells involves examining them from various angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. Typically, shells are viewed from an apertural perspective, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first viewing the shell from the apical perspective and determining where the first suture begins. By drawing a line to divide the shell into two parts, we can then count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl. \n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal grows its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture, we can use coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented, allowing us to formulate a mathematical model of the mollusk's skeletogenesis. Once we have a mathematical formulation, we can then vary parameters to modify the mollusk's development.",
            "For the past decade, Indonesia has seen little progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality rates.  Despite making significant strides in achieving Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, the country still lags behind in improving child and maternal health indicators.  To understand the reasons behind these shortcomings, it's essential to examine the health system's weaknesses, rather than focusing solely on program-specific interventions.\n\nOne area of improvement has been the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this target.  However, this statistic includes traditional workers like midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complicated pregnancies and, as a result, contribute to high maternal mortality rates due to hemorrhage.  This achievement is somewhat misleading, highlighting the need for further action.  Furthermore, there's been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a healthcare professional.  Data on postnatal care is incomplete, but it's clear that this area is a concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nThe cesarean-section rate in Indonesia remains unacceptably low at around 4%.  This rate is even more concerning when considering the significant disparity between urban and rural areas, with a 5% difference between the two.  This disparity is a clear indication of unequal access to healthcare services, with a focus on urban areas.  Another issue is the lack of vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  It's clear that the poor face significant challenges in accessing healthcare services, largely due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to effectively address the lack of service.  Should Indonesia focus on developing program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system, prioritizing the well-being of mothers and children before and after pregnancy?  While programmatic approaches may seem appealing due to their targeted objectives and potential for faster results, there are significant drawbacks to consider.  One major concern is that investing heavily in one area can lead to a lack of funding and resources for other critical areas, causing a brain drain of skilled healthcare workers.  Additionally, running multiple parallel programs for the same area can result in duplication of services, increased paperwork, and inefficiencies.",
            "Victorian novels are often associated with their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the time period.  However, two novels that stand out from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both of these novels incorporate elements of mystery and a touch of the bizarre, which deviates from the typical characteristics of the era.  This unique approach enhances the characters within each work, offering a deeper look into their thoughts and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist delves into the darker side of the period, the author skillfully weaves together a complex web of thoughts and events.  The main character's mind is flooded with jumbled ideas, making it difficult for him to distinguish reality from fantasy.  In one particular instance, Oliver finds himself walking between Sikes and Crackit, who are engaged in a heated argument.  The words they speak seem to echo in his mind, and when he regains his composure, he realizes that he's having a conversation with them.  Suddenly, the sound of gunfire shatters the atmosphere, and Oliver is swept away by an unseen force.  Throughout this chaotic scene, Oliver experiences a nagging sense of pain, which haunts him relentlessly.\n\nBoth novels use dream sequences or dreamlike states to convey this sense of mystery, although the content and purpose vary between the two.  Oliver Twist often employs these strange occurrences to reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, his deep-seated fears, and his perception of the world around him.  When Oliver relives the shooting scene in chapter 28, he does so in a state of vivid imagination, as if it's a recurring nightmare.  This passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the events that unfold, as well as the dire state of his health, which is reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit.  The shooting overwhelms Oliver, numbing his senses as he's whisked away by an unseen force.  He's forced to relive his despair, his pain now constant and linked to fear rather than surprise.  This scene raises questions about whose will led to his misfortune, as it was certainly not his own.  Oliver's growing sense of defeat is also implied, as if Fagin's influence has broken him, forcing him to accept this despair and rendering him unable to react.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the author similarly employs dreamlike states to convey the turmoil and mystery of the characters.  The passage describes the passage of time as a perpetual state of limbo, with days blurring together and nights feeling both long and fleeting.  This sense of timelessness reflects the characters' own emotional states, which are characterized by a sense of desperation and longing.",
            "A couple of years ago, I worked at an after-school program where I tutored elementary age students in various subjects. My strengths were in English and reading, and I was assigned to help a boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. As I worked with him, I realized that something was amiss - he had an unusual problem with reading. Some letters he could pronounce perfectly, while others were way off. It was quite peculiar. Adrian's parents were of Latino descent, but he spoke perfect English, which only added to the confusion. We made little progress until I met his mother, who only spoke Spanish. With my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate, and it hit me like a ton of bricks: Adrian could read just fine, but he just didn't know the English alphabet well. I hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the problem of the language barrier in schools, particularly in California. It's not always as obvious as we think, and even a child who speaks perfect English can still struggle with reading. Everyone agrees that this problem exists, so what's the solution? In Adrian's case, tutoring in English reading, especially the alphabet and pronunciations, was relatively straightforward. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complex. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these alone will fix the problem. The key lies in combining them all.\n\nThe dual language system is an excellent idea, not just for children whose first language is Spanish, but for all children. Studies have shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many fear that this approach is a waste of resources, but that's a misconception. If we were to implement these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all children would benefit from them. So, how do we do it? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic. Instead, we could have special aids, tutors, or whatever you call them, who are bilingual.",
            "For most of us, the concept of something greater than ourselves has been instilled in us since childhood. We've been taught about it in Sunday school, at Temple, or in our own introspection. Some of us accept the faith passed down to us from our parents, while others reject it entirely, believing that there's no truth beyond our own personal perspectives. We might switch between different value systems, searching for a guiding light in the darkness. This search for meaning helps us define ourselves and find our own unique sense of spirituality.\n\nI recall a conversation with my dad, where he revealed his favorite type of bird – the cardinal.  We sat on our porch, listening to the rain, the smell of our cigarettes lingering in the air. The sound of the rainwater rushing through the gutters and drowning the nearby plants created a melancholic atmosphere. My dad's appearance had changed in recent months; he'd lost weight, and his hair had thinned out. He stared into the rain, lost in thought, avoiding eye contact. I felt a mix of emotions – loneliness, fear, and the inability to talk to him about his impending passing. I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in gazing out into the rain, trying to cherish the moment.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his life, but not alleviated his suffering. I couldn't understand the purpose of prolonging his suffering. I stopped praying, wondering if God had stopped listening to me long ago. If there was a God, I thought, he must have stopped caring about me.\n\nI didn't want to witness my father's final moments, so I chose not to be there. I wanted to remember him for the life he lived, not the way he died. I knew my dad better than anyone, and I believed he wouldn't have wanted me to be a spectator to his passing. I spent three days curled up in bed, waiting for the news. But no one even bothered to call me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is an intriguing oxymoron that encapsulates the essence of something both old and new.  As Ian Watt so eloquently puts it, \"Gothic Novel\" is, in essence, 'Old-New.' The Gothic mode has been met with both praise and criticism, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others admiring its ability to evoke the 'terrible sublime' (Burke).  In creating the first \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto skillfully blended elements of both the old and modern romance genres, forging a new literary path. Walpole cleverly combined ancient theatrical elements and modern novelistic mimicry to craft a story he called \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). This novel drew heavily from medieval theatrical traditions, architecture, and customs, which were seen as outdated and unsophisticated in comparison to the modern world. The fusion of these elements with the novel's format, which allowed readers a more personal glimpse into the characters' psychology, is what has allowed the Gothic genre to endure and maintain its relevance across time, becoming both obsolete and new to readers from different eras.\n\nOne of the central themes in Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry, which originated in the medieval era. The original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, retains and reinterprets this concept, elevating it to an idealized state. Chivalry represented the epitome of the noble knight: brave, honorable, and competent. Gothic writers, including Walpole, were drawn to this ideal and saw it as a benchmark for the present society, which they perceived as lacking. By employing chivalric concepts and mannerisms, the \"gothic past\" was romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic to Romanticism. This is exemplified in characters like Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, including being a prince, having suffered through tragedy, and being mistakenly believed to have been killed by infidels. Frederic's description is replete with traditional chivalric imagery, which is later exaggerated, introducing the trope of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the intricate process of moving goods from the initial customer order to the final stage of distribution, encompassing the raw materials, production, and delivery to the customer. This concept was first coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant who described the entire process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to satisfy customers' needs in a timely and efficient manner. At the heart of supply chain management are six fundamental elements: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. By mastering these elements, business managers can provide top-notch customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundation upon which the entire supply chain process is built. It involves determining the when, why, where, and how of production, including understanding customer demands. To grasp customer needs, managers examine market trends, which serve as the largest indicator of customer demands. Once market analysis is complete, managers decide what products to produce, in what quantities, and where to produce them, taking into account customer satisfaction and demand. Scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment are also crucial tasks at this stage. As I've witnessed firsthand in my past experience working at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores, having a well-defined process and layout is essential for smooth operations and prevents confusion and misdirection.\n\nSupply, the second key element, involves making strategic decisions about the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its unique equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must choose the most suitable division for each process or decide to outsource work to other companies to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. By streamlining operations through outsourcing, companies can reduce costs and maintain a competitive edge.",
            "I recently came across a disturbing message scrawled on a street corner in Burma, a country ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a violent coup. The sign held by Ellen Page, star of the critically acclaimed film Juno, reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma\", a haunting reference to the country's history of oppression and human rights abuses. Burma, also known as Myanmar, has been plagued by protests and violence, including the infamous \"Saffron Revolution\" of 2007, led by Buddhist monks who were met with brutal suppression by the military.\n\nThe situation in Burma is just one example of a long history of governments trying to silence dissent and maintain control over their citizens. Throughout history, rulers have claimed divine right to absolute power, from early Roman emperors to Japanese emperors who were believed to be gods. Even in modern times, some leaders have used their positions to silence critics and opponents. For instance, President George W. Bush has been known to consult with Ted Haggard, the head of a conservative Christian group, on a regular basis.\n\nThere have been numerous examples of brutal suppression of dissent throughout history. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where students and intellectuals demanded an end to authoritarian rule, resulted in a reported death toll of between 200 and 3,000 people. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militias and the government killed an estimated 800,000 people, is another extreme example of state-sponsored violence. The Nazi regime's systematic persecution and murder of Jews and other minority groups during World War II is a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and hatred.",
            "Duke Ellington left a lasting impact on jazz primarily due to his extended career and his exceptional ability to shape his orchestra. While his piano presence is subtle in many of the compositions featured in this assignment, as a composer Ellington excelled in crafting rich and complex pieces that showcased the unique talents of each band member. He developed the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing intricately orchestrated sections that highlighted the distinct styles of individual band members. By doing so, Ellington also emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra, creating cohesive and original sounds to suit each piece. His mastery of each player's sound and how they interacted within the growing ensemble allowed him to create some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative approach to sound and voice in his work, particularly in Creole Love Call, where he uses voice as a jazz instrument throughout his career. This early example demonstrates Ellington's ability to enhance texture and color without the restrictions of lyrics. Creole Love Call, a slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece, features six distinct choruses that showcase Ellington's ability to complement the style of his soloists. The piece's structure is as follows:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response exchange between voice and reeds, starting with a smooth and melodic voice that transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus with a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this chorus, the voice takes on the \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: A brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add tone color to this piece is just one example of a stylistic trait that runs throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound by blending the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "There was this persistent feeling inside of her that never seemed to be satisfied. It started when she was 14, as she was navigating the ups and downs of being a teenager. Three years later, at 17, she was still trying to make sense of it. She had come to the realization that she wanted someone rather than something, but nothing seemed to spark her interest in the guys around her. She often found herself pondering this strange phenomenon, trying to figure out what could be causing it. Theories had crossed her mind, but none of them seemed quite right.\n\nFor the most part, life at home was pretty laid-back. Her parents were easy-going and never argued with each other. They rarely argued with her either, except when she pushed her boundaries and asserted her independence. It was a trait that actually made her quite likable, given her friendly and outgoing personality.\n\nBut today was a different story. As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, she was startled by a faint scream from the kitchen and her mother's distressed voice. Her heart racing, she rushed into the room, asking \"Mom, what's wrong?!\" She found her mother lying on the ground, wincing in pain. Her daughter quickly went to her side and put a supportive hand on her, trying to help. \"Ow... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother managed to say between deep breaths. The daughter sprang into action, helping her mother to the car and getting her comfortable in the backseat.\n\nThe hospital was a whirlwind of disinfectant and anxiety, but she was so focused on her mother's well-being that she didn't register the fear. She rushed her mother inside and called for medical help. A team of worried faces gathered around, and they quickly got her mother onto a rolling bed and whisked her away for immediate attention. Her daughter was left sitting anxiously, waiting for news.\n\nIt turned out her mother had taken a tumble off a stepping stool while trying to grab a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between adhering to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality. The study found that a \"modified Med diet score\" (aMed score), which emphasizes the consumption of plant-based foods, healthy fats, and fish, is associated with a reduced risk of CHD and stroke. This modified Med diet is characterized by higher intake of fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, monounsaturated fats, and fish, and lower intake of animal products and saturated fats, with moderate alcohol consumption allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that a Med diet is linked to a lower risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and that it's more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, these studies didn't specifically examine the relationship between the Med diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of heart disease or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six periods from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated the aMed diet score using questionnaires that asked participants about their nutrient intake over the past year. Almost all participants continued to participate throughout the 20-year study period.\n\nThe researchers validated the accuracy of the questionnaires and confirmed reports of heart disease, stroke, and other health outcomes through medical records, hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were not available, the researchers classified the cases as \"probable,\" which accounted for about 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal heart attacks.\n\nTo account for individual variations in diet and better represent long-term dietary habits, the researchers averaged the aMed scores from multiple questionnaires over time. They also adjusted for potential confounders, such as age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing a statistical model, the researchers found that a higher aMed score was associated with a lower risk of CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 cases of CHD, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths were reported. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a devastating economic downturn. High unemployment rates, a collapsing housing market, and the downfall of top corporations left many wondering how this financial disaster occurred and how it can be prevented. To put it simply, the crisis was born from reckless and uninformed political decisions that pressured banks and companies to issue sub-prime loans into a fragile financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were forced to take on and repackage these mortgages into complex financial instruments, only to see the entire economy suffer when borrowers defaulted on these loans. The chaos then spread to the repackaged mortgages and, ultimately, the rest of the economy.\n\nThe roots of this financial disaster date back to the late 1990s, during the Clinton administration. President Clinton sought to bolster his popularity by relaxing lending restrictions, which ultimately created the perfect storm for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. As reported by Steven Holmes of the New York Times in 1999, Fannie Mae, the country's largest mortgage underwriter, was under pressure from the administration to expand mortgage loans to low- and moderate-income individuals, while also meeting the expectations of its shareholders. Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As previously discussed, the reckless lending practices would inevitably lead to a catastrophic economic collapse.\n \nA combination of factors contributed to the economic downturn, one of which was the complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led U.S. households and financial markets to become heavily invested in the housing market, leaving them vulnerable to even slight price changes. \nWhen the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities were severely affected. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for about 30% of the country's GDP. Ultimately, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a low price, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were taken over by the government in September 2008.",
            "Ah, the infamous exposition - that section of your story where your writing skills are put to the test, leaving readers either in awe or nodding off in their chairs. Dr. Merlin has been known to frantically click the 'undo' button more than once when she finds herself drowning in a sea of unnecessary details. Exposition, it seems, is not exactly a welcome guest in the world of storytelling.\n\nAs writers, we've all been warned about the perils of \"telling, not showing,\" but Dr. Merlin still succumbs to lengthy descriptions of backstories, often leaving readers wondering when the real story will begin. Exposition is the pesky critic on your shoulder, urging you to provide context at the expense of actual plot progression. It's the voice that whispers, \"Get the history out of the way so we can get to the good stuff.\"\n\nIn fiction, exposition is when an author chooses to tell the reader what's happening, rather than show it through action, dialogue, or sensory details. In film, it's often manifested as a character dumping a wealth of information on another character, usually in a clunky and info-dumpy way. Think of it as a literary equivalent of a \"core dump\" a la \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"\n\nTake, for instance, a story where the protagonist's love interest is introduced with a grandiose passage detailing their entire history: where they met, how they married, and the tragic circumstances of their partner's demise. It's unlikely that this lengthy exposition would unfold over two pages, with the couple barely exchanging a few lines of dialogue. Instead, a skilled author would weave a more nuanced introduction, gradually revealing the husband's character through their speech, mannerisms, and interactions. This would not only make the reader invested in their fate but also provide valuable insight into the protagonist's personality, values, and motivations.\n\nBy adding depth and context to the bare-bones narrative, you create an emotionally resonant connection between the reader and the characters. In short, you'd expect the story to deliver more than just the skeletal outline: \"They met, they married, he died.\" A good writer knows that there's no substitute for rich, sensory details that breathe life into the narrative.\n\nSo, the next time you find yourself tempted to skim over the surface-level details, remember that a good story is built on more than just exposition. Provide the meat, not just the bones.",
            "I recently watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio, which left me thinking about the way news is presented. The first one I tuned into was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). They had a breaking story about a man in Ashley, Ohio, who stabbed his wife. The man's name was Shad Hostettler, and the news team devoted a reasonable two minutes to the developing story, stating that he had stabbed her multiple times and been arrested. I believe this was an adequate amount of coverage for the circumstances.\n\nThe second story that caught my attention was about an early morning shooting of an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and no arrests had been made at the time. The SWAT team was investigating the crime, but this story seemed to be glossed over. I've noticed a pattern where minorities are often underreported when they're victims of a crime. In contrast, when a white person is a victim, the media tends to go into overdrive, whereas if it's a minority person, they're lucky if it even gets mentioned.\n\nThe news team then moved on to a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. They shared details about the location where the incident occurred and stated that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers were offering a $5,000 reward for tips that could lead to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe forecast for the weekend was also covered, with predictions of rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. Temperatures were expected to remain in the mid to low eighties, but the segment was a bit too brief and seemed like a teaser to keep viewers hooked.\n\nAnother story they ran with was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, approximately six feet tall, and weighing around 150 pounds. I found it striking that they spent an unusual amount of time emphasizing his skin color and how dark he was.\n\nLastly, they covered a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who was found guilty of conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. What caught my attention was that instead of stating the sentence as 25 years in prison, they mentioned \"300 months,\" which seemed unnecessary and possibly an attempt to make the sentence sound harsher. Additionally, they mentioned that he was a Hispanic man, which I didn't think was particularly relevant to the story.",
            "In the intricate web of human relationships, the bond between brothers stands out as an unbreakable and complex connection. This unique tie is woven with various emotions - love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty - making it hard to unravel. Brothers have a deep understanding of each other that goes beyond the realm of ordinary relationships, and when they look at their brothers, they see a reflection of themselves. It's during intense moments that the true nature of their bond reveals itself, whether it's a beautiful or a destructive one. These emotions come with a cost, and dealing with their consequences is an integral part of understanding the bond. When one brother looks into another and sees their own reflection staring back, they gain insight into their own character through their actions and the repercussions that follow.\n\nIn James Hurst's \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" this theme is expertly explored, along with the cluster of emotions that come with it. Against the backdrop of a rich, vivid landscape, two brothers embark on a doomed journey, where bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in a heart-wrenching climax. Only one brother manages to escape alive. The theme is skillfully conveyed through the direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as the narrator's perspective, which highlights the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and their perception of the world around them. Both of these greatly influence their actions.\n\nAt the core of the protagonist's behavior lies a single, driving emotion: pride. From their initial outings together until their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had envisioned a brother who could learn from him and share in his adventures, like \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp.\" He wanted a companion to join him in racing to Horsehead Landing and perching in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's fragile health made these dreams seem impossible. Born with a weak heart, Doodle's prospects for survival, let alone participating in physically demanding activities, were slim to none. The young protagonist's fantasies were shattered in an instant, leaving him with a deep sense of disappointment and frustration. He even grapples with anger towards his brother, as revealed by his recollection of contemplating suffocating him with a pillow. Yet, his heart softens when Doodle smiles at him, revealing a glimmer of hope. This moment showcases the protagonist's innate love for his brother, which he had likely been hiding beneath his pride and anger.",
            "The human brain is a complex and innovative system that processes information in a multitude of ways. Over the years, our understanding of the brain has advanced, and so have the metaphors used to describe it. Initially, we thought of the brain like a simple wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, then a book, and more recently, a computer. However, it's essential to remember that these metaphors are limited and can lead to oversimplification and incorrect conclusions.\n\nThe process of information processing starts when our sensory organs transform physical stimuli, such as touch, heat, sound, or light, into electrical signals. This sensory information is then repeatedly processed by the brain using both bottom-up and top-down approaches. For instance, when looking at a black box on a white background, the brain's bottom-up processing puts together basic information like color, orientation, and object borders to identify the box. Top-down processing then speeds up recognition by using the decisions made during bottom-up processing. It might help you identify the object as a black box instead of a hole in the background.\n\nAs information is processed to a certain level, an attention filter decides its importance and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when looking down, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually, but you might pick out your name in a noisy room. There are various stages of processing, and the results are constantly modulated by attention.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Information is encoded in various ways specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically, depending on its appearance, sound, or meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Research suggests that working memory, which stores information for around 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a series of neurons for a short period. Long-term memory is thought to be maintained through the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are various models describing how knowledge is organized in the brain, each based on different approaches like human memory retrieval, computer science, or neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts and that these nodes are linked based on their relatedness.

            "In his thought-provoking novel, Brave New World, Aldous Huxley issues a stark warning about the dangers of unchecked technological advancements and the capitalistic systems that drive them. He creates a dystopian society where people value community over individuality and are conditioned to prioritize immediate gratification above all else. The citizens are mere pawns in a larger game, confined to a narrow ideology dictated by the World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, one can see Huxley's underlying concerns about the development of these systems, which eerily foreshadow the emerging economy of his time.\n\nHuxley uses Marxist concepts to satirize capitalism, highlighting the idea of false consciousness. In this context, the common citizenry is kept in the dark about their true relationships with other social classes, too focused on their own self-interest to grasp the bigger picture. This is achieved through the ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, as evident in the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The lower classes, represented by Deltas and Gammas, are devoid of autonomy, with their drive to consume, spend, and indulge amplified through hypnopædia. The World Controller masterfully manipulates this desire, showcasing a clear example of hegemony, where a dominant group (the upper classes) exercises control over the others. The lower classes are oblivious to this manipulation, literally buying into an ideology that reinforces the existing social structure. Meanwhile, the upper classes, represented by Alphas and Betas, are aware of the manipulation but choose to accept their position, with few exceptions like Bernard.\n\nIn this world, meaningful relationships between individuals are non-existent. Characters are one-dimensional, lacking depth, which may suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism together rob people of their free will and emotional expression. Love and intense emotions are absent, replaced by superficial interactions, often reduced to shallow comments about physical appearance. The complacency of each social class within the hierarchy is a testament to the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where individuals are convinced of their superiority as long as they conform to the norms of their peers.",
            "As a student at University Park for over two and a half years now, I've experienced the challenges of navigating campus. For many of us, including myself, getting around campus can be a real issue. My freshman year, I was assigned to an East Halls dorm, which is situated on the far eastern edge of campus – excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. The commute from Stuart Hall, my hometown on campus, to classes in the Willard building, near the heart of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather is bad. I recently spoke to a fellow alumnus who's not much older than me, and they shared that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the school by vast tracts of unused land. Today, that empty space has been transformed into sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and the health services building, and surrounding apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes increasingly difficult. In my opinion, the best solution to this problem is the bicycle. However, having a bike is only half the battle – students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with the needs of bicyclists in mind.\n\nI had a conversation with a friend who recently took up bicycling again after a few-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped cycling in the first place. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is bicycling good for your physical health, but it's also the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical exertion can take you 30 miles or more. As an off-campus resident, I'm just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was buying a bike. With my classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my home, I can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only catch is that Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to navigate, whether I'm on a bike or on foot. While walking has its merits, I'm just too busy to do it. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class, and it would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That's over two and a half hours every week – time I just can't afford to spare."
