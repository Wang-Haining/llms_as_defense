            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "My career ambition is to pursue an occupation in social work, specifically with the Division of Family and Children Services, to make a positive difference in the lives of children who have been abused or neglected and to offer support to struggling families. The core values that will guide my professional development in this field include a commitment to service, respect, an unwavering commitment to ethics, a dedication to enhancing relationships between individuals, and a continuous striving for professional growth and competence.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been a driving force in my life, and I was initially uncertain about the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my high school and college years, I witnessed many individuals struggling with their problems, some using coping mechanisms that weren't ideal, and others turning a blind eye to their issues. These experiences led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Although I still hadn't determined my ideal career path, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. A pivotal encounter with a friend's 16-year-old friend, who was escaping an abusive home life, prompted me to consider a career in social work. I realized that my degree in Psychology could be used to make a tangible difference in the lives of those who needed it most. I soon found myself visiting the teenager's parents' house, where I expressed my concerns to the police and offered to speak with the parents. This experience crystallized my resolve to pursue a career in social work, where I can help children and families navigate complex family dynamics.\n\nSocial justice is another value that is deeply ingrained in me, and I believe it's essential for the social work profession. As a society, we often claim to value individuality, but our actions often contradict this sentiment. We mourn the loss of individuals, yet we strive to conform to societal norms and expectations. I, on the other hand, celebrate my uniqueness and refuse to be bound by arbitrary limitations. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively protested against social injustice whenever possible: expressing my individuality through bold fashion choices, speaking out against racism and discrimination, and participating in social justice movements like the GSBA. I will continue to champion social justice and stand up against injustice in all its forms.",
            "Insomnia, a sleep disorder that affects millions, has been a topic of interest in both the biological and sociocultural realms.  The biological model sheds light on the genetic and physiological factors that contribute to insomnia, while the sociocultural model explores the environmental influences that impact sleep patterns. This review will delve into the biological and sociocultural models of insomnia, examining the research that underlies each and critiquing their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders related to other mental health issues, or sleep disorders caused by medical conditions or substance intake. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias, such as Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and others, which affect an individual's ability to initiate and maintain sleep. On the other hand, Parasomnias, like Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder, are characterized by behavioral and physiological abnormalities during sleep.\n\nThe biological model focuses on the genetic and physiological aspects of insomnia, with research indicating that neurons in the hypothalamus play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states, and activating the GABAA receptor promotes sleep. Conversely, inhibiting this receptor can lead to reduced anxiety and increased sleep time. These findings suggest that genetic and environmental factors contribute to the physical GABAB receptor in humans, and abnormalities in this receptor may affect an individual's ability to sleep without medication.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study are significant, as inherited genetic traits can regulate sleep patterns, and alterations to the receptor can disturb sleep, impacting daily life activities. This highlights the importance of understanding the biological underpinnings of insomnia and how they intersect with environmental factors, such as demographics, socioeconomic status, and cultural background.\n\nBy examining the biological and sociocultural models of insomnia, researchers and healthcare professionals can better understand the complexities of this sleep disorder and develop more effective treatments. A comprehensive approach that takes into account both biological and environmental factors is essential for addressing the multifaceted nature of insomnia.",
            "This paper delves into the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, a concise explanation of the disorder is provided. Following this, the diagnosis process is explored, highlighting common characteristics that serve as warning signs. Lastly, the paper concludes by discussing ways in which a teacher in a mainstream classroom setting can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's inefficiency in processing auditory information. In essence, the central nervous system (CNS) struggles to interpret and differentiate sounds, making it challenging for individuals with CAPD to distinguish words, conversations, and background noise. Unlike those with hearing impairments, people with CAPD can hear normally, but the area of the brain responsible for sound processing is not functioning as it should.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has its roots in the 1950s, when it was initially referred to as \"auditory imperception.\" Researchers, including the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began developing tests to identify children with communicative disorders in the mid-1950s. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiological mechanisms underlying dichotic perception.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways, including difficulties with sound localization, distinguishing between multiple auditory events, recognizing sound patterns, and differentiating changes in speech. Additionally, individuals with CAPD may experience auditory masking, where one sound is blocked by a subsequent sound, or struggle to synthesize sound clues to interpret them meaningfully. They may also have trouble determining the sequence of auditory information presented to them.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a thorough evaluation is required, involving systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals use various measures to assess auditory-related skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors. There is no single, consistently effective tool or test for diagnosing CAPD, and its causes remain unknown. Advanced tests may involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "It seems that the play Twelfth Night suggests that while a disguise can be a useful tool for deception, it can ultimately lead to a loss of identity if it is not shed. However, abandoning a deception can also result in alienation. This creates a difficult decision for the individual, who must weigh the importance of self-preservation against the preservation of relationships with others. Some people may not take kindly to being deceived, and may feel offended by the charade. \n\nThe theme of deception in the context of gender role reversal is particularly problematic, as it raises questions about the motivations behind such behavior. In the case of Viola, her decision to disguise herself as a man is a form of self-protection in a foreign land. However, this approach also isolates her from the support system of women around her. Her convincing portrayal of a man even leads Olivia to confuse her with her twin brother Sebastian, causing her to fall in love with Viola. This adds to the complexity of Viola's situation, as she also struggles with suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino. \n\nWhile Twelfth Night may seem progressive in its portrayal of unexpressed emotions, it can also be seen as highlighting the ways in which deception can lead to the revelation of hidden desires, as seen in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may have subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario based on his masculine appearance, or does she genuinely harbor feelings for women? It is likely that Olivia is satirizing the people of her time who judge others based on appearance alone, as evidenced by her swift shift in romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian.",
            "I've always thought that the German colonial empire was a complex beast, with policies and ruling styles as varied as its geography. While it's often noted for its brutal aspects, such as the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa, it's clear that the empire's educational provisions were just as diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a population of educated and literate Africans, which was a stark contrast to what they would find in other colonies. For instance, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were praised by contemporary authors, but the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) was a far cry from these successes. Unlike in East Africa, where the government took a leading role in education, in South West Africa the task of educating the natives was left largely to missionary societies, which received limited government support. This had significant and lasting effects on the colony.\n\nOne of the key factors that contributed to these divergent experiences was the presence of a large settler population in South West Africa. This is a point that Cohen's study highlights, comparing the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa. According to Cohen, the relatively temperate climate and large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of its educational system. With nearly 15,000 whites living in South West Africa by 1913, compared to just 5,336 in East Africa, it's clear that the colonial authorities in South West Africa had a different set of priorities. While they invested in state schools and supported missionary schools for European settlers, the native population was largely left to fend for themselves. The result was that \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" This legacy of neglect continues to shape the region to this day, and it's a fascinating topic of study.\n\nIn terms of existing literature, there's a wealth of research on education in the German colonial empire, most of which is in German and from the early twentieth century. While these early sources provide valuable insights into the features of educational systems in different colonies, later studies in English have expanded the discourse, offering comparative analyses of education in the various German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific aspects of education. Cohen's study is a standout in this regard, providing a nuanced understanding of the factors that contributed to the divergent experiences of South West Africa and East Africa.",
            "The world of popular music has undergone a significant transformation over the past hundred years, evolving into a vast array of genres that seem to have no end. To make matters more complex, many of these genres have spawned their own sub and sub-sub genres, leaving it challenging to provide an exhaustive list. However, one genre that has managed to stand out in the past four decades is Heavy Metal rock, which has become a melting pot of diverse and expressive styles.\n\nHeavy Metal's expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, predominantly the darker aspects of human experience. The genre's diversity, on the other hand, is a result of its flexibility, which allowed musicians to experiment and create their own unique sub-genres. Over time, this process has continued, resulting in a multitude of niches that make it difficult to define what Heavy Metal truly is.\n\nToday, Heavy Metal has evolved to incorporate elements from other genres, yet its roots remain a mystery. To truly comprehend the vast array of Metal music that surrounds us, one must first grasp the essence of the Metal movement and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nAt its core, Metal is a movement defined by darkness – a \"music of more\" that features louder volumes, more intensity, and a greater emphasis on theatricality. Metal musicians are known for their exceptional skill and technical prowess, which is evident in their music. Moreover, Metal's history is deeply intertwined with the world of psychedelia, with the mid-70s drug boom playing a significant role in shaping the genre. Many iconic Metal bands drew inspiration from the darker, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era, resulting in lyrics that reflect the genre's affinity for the darker aspects of human emotion.\n\nTake, for instance, the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter,\" a song that has been cited as one of the first Heavy Metal tracks. Its lyrics, which explore the ups and downs of a supposed psychedelic experience, demonstrate the genre's affinity for the darker side of human experience. This song was, in part, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker sound, with the Beatles seeking to prove that they could rival their peers in terms of intensity.",
            "A few decades before Surrealist artists started bringing their dreamlike works to life, Henri Rousseau was quietly crafting his own dreams – both in his paintings and in his imagination. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only captures a woman's awe at the wonders of the fantastical land she visits in her dreams, but also reflects Rousseau's own dreams and aspirations as a painter. For years, he longed to be recognized, accepted, and praised by his fellow artists and art enthusiasts. However, he faced a tough inner struggle: should he conform to established styles to gain acceptance or stay true to his unique vision and forge his own path?\n\nTo understand The Dream, it's essential to know a bit about Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, Henri grew up in a relatively comfortable household with a father who was a successful tinsmith and hardware dealer. Despite his comfortable upbringing, Rousseau received no formal art training and instead worked for the French government as a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, until he was 40. The nickname that stuck, douanier (customs inspector), was a far cry from his true passion – painting. After the loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children, Rousseau found solace in art, hoping it would bring him comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries, who sentimentalized and romanticized the peasant in their paintings, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of the average person.\n\nGiven his circumstances, it's no wonder Rousseau yearned for recognition from the art world. He was an older artist starting his career at a time when many talented and well-known modern artists were already established. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse began gaining recognition that Rousseau started to receive the accolades he deserved. According to Jan Gordon in his book Modern French Painters, Rousseau and Matisse were distinct not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for creating art: while Matisse sought to avoid painting in a conventional manner, Rousseau aimed to create a picture so conventional that it would earn him acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "Many influential thinkers have long argued that there's a profound connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. In my opinion, this connection stems from a fundamental aspect that ties them together. As John Keats so eloquently puts it in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We often learn various aspects of life through education or personal experiences, but our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to be derived from a different source, as Keats suggests. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe, rather than dictate. Our studies of morality and beauty are primarily attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nIn essence, criticism of art or morals can never fully grasp the essence of what's good or beautiful. Discussing the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might center around concepts like foreground, background, or cultural context, but these aspects don't capture why it's considered good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like \"There's just something about it\" before providing a more complex explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor so astutely observes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe a work of literature, there's always something transcendent left untouched. Similarly, I propose that ethics has this same quality. As Wittgenstein aptly notes, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this \"something\", this je ne sais quoi, is what makes art and morality so powerful, and this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\nIn my opinion, morality and art are closely related because we experience both at a deep, noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be felt, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to literature, an art form that stands out due to its unique moral quality, as McKean notes. He argues that, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a strong and unified country with a unique blend of culture that spans from the picturesque Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This rich culture is also evident in cities like Cologne on the Rhine River, the heart of Germany, and the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. It's no surprise that Germany's identity is shaped by its complex history and the diverse tribes that have influenced its development over time. \n\nThe origins of the name \"Germania\" are shrouded in mystery, with scholars and historians debating its true meaning. Some attribute it to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe mentioned by the Roman historian Tacitus. According to him, they were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine River and clashed with the Gaulish forces. Julius Caesar, who first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, believed it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In his writings, Caesar noted that the Germans lived beyond the Rhine River and were constantly at war with the Gauls. Others speculate that the name \"German\" comes from the spear used in warfare, known as a \"ger\" in Old English, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which might indicate the Germans were a loud and boisterous people.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote extensively about the origins of the Germans in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum.\" He described the Germans as an aboriginal people, untouched by other cultures through immigration or interaction. According to Tacitus, only those who were driven by desperation would leave their homes in Asia or Africa to venture into the harsh and unforgiving landscape of Germany. The Romans, for their part, were content to trade with the Germanic tribes and occasionally launch military campaigns into their territory, but they rarely settled there.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and skills with the Romans in exchange for their military service. The Germans' reputation as fierce warriors and skilled traders was well-known throughout the ancient world, shaping the course of European history for centuries to come.",
            "As I stood there, my gaze drifted downwards, taking in the scene before me, but my mind remained blank, unwilling to grasp the significance of what I was seeing. It was as if I was observing it all from a detached perspective, without any emotional connection. My thoughts flitted in and out of my consciousness, fleeting and ephemeral, never really taking hold. My mental processes hummed along, efficient and smooth, creating a seamless experience, but devoid of any real introspection.\n\nI recalled a conversation with an artist I had worked with, who recommended an instructional book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had long been fascinated by drawing, ever since I was a child, and this book promised to teach me the fundamentals. One technique it highlighted was to frame a picture with a square, stripping away extraneous details and reducing it to its essence. I had always been overwhelmed by the complexity of the world around me, and I longed to capture its beauty.\n\nAt that moment, staring at the bowl of food in front of me, I couldn't even imagine applying that artist's perspective. I was too caught up in the sheer magnitude of what I was seeing. I felt like I was stumbling upon a masterpiece, the start of something magnificent. I had always admired the works of Picasso, Monet, and the Renaissance masters, each with their own unique style and vision. If I was to consider myself an artist, this could be the beginning of my own masterpiece, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand hovered over the pencil, and for a moment, I felt the urge to create. My muscles tensed, and my hand began to move, but instead of sketching, I was gripping the toilet handle. The water swirled, serene and smooth, but the brown package remained stuck. I stood there, frowning, my green tie constricting my neck, as I gazed at the mess someone had left behind. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and then I reached for the toilet paper, my hand instinctively wrapping itself like a mitten. I stood up straight, bent at the waist, and slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, as if I was approaching a sacred ritual, or perhaps a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "The alarming trend of teenage drivers behind the wheel is a grave concern in the United States.  Several factors contribute to this devastating statistic, and one key reason is the fact that the teen brain is not yet fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Inexperience is another crucial factor, which not only leads to fatal accidents but also increases the risk of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.  To make matters worse, teenagers are more likely to engage in reckless behavior when they're driving with their peers, a disturbing trend that is all too common.  According to the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, there's a clear correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents that occur.\n\nIn an effort to address this issue, many states have implemented provisional licenses that restrict the hours teens can drive and prohibit other minors from being passengers.  However, I believe these measures are merely a temporary fix.  The root problem lies in the fact that, as a group, the youngest drivers are not yet capable of handling the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that even at 18, many individuals are still prone to thrill-seeking behavior, making it essential to delay the granting of regular driver's licenses until this tendency has subsided.  If we continue to issue licenses to young teens, the number of fatal accidents will likely skyrocket, especially when the Baby Boomer babies reach driving age and millions of new teen drivers hit the road by 2010. \n\nA sensible solution to this issue would involve schools continuing to provide driver's education classes to prepare future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 would be allowed to operate a vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full driver's license, along with a set number of practical driver's training hours, such as the 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult currently required in California.  Uniform, national legislation addressing this issue would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country.  This idea is not new, but it's a crucial step towards preventing the staggering number of teen driving fatalities that will surely occur if we fail to act.",
            "I spent some time browsing through the Library of Congress's early film collection and decided to watch all 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films rely heavily on creative editing to create illusions. My study of these films primarily focused on understanding the poetic techniques used in most of them and analyzing the unique characteristics of a few of the later films that broke free from traditional norms. It's worth noting that most trick films from this era are set-bound, shot from a frontal proscenium, feature no camera movement, and stick to the one shot = one film concept, but there were a few exceptions that dared to challenge these conventions.\n\nOne of the most notable similarities among the trick films is their use of interior sets within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary and does not move to follow characters or objects, a style that originated from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. This method has a limitation, however, as figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, never walking towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, never leaving the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also means that most shots are long shots, with medium shots appearing less frequently. Close-up shots are completely absent in these early Edison films, drawing from the theatre and vaudeville tradition where the audience sees the entire performance at a time, framed by the stage borders. As with most early films, the actors do not approach the camera, so close-ups are nonexistent.\n\nIn general, most early trick films follow the pattern of one conceptual shot equalling a film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also restricts the use of tricks in storytelling, with most films focusing on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts. However, closer inspection reveals that a single \"shot\" can actually be composed of multiple joined shots to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where a more detailed look reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a true champion of Republicanism, and his dedication to this cause was evident in both his agricultural pursuits and his brief foray into politics. As a result, he became known for his unwavering commitment to personal freedoms and government accountability. His views on governance were deeply rooted in his beliefs about the importance of an agrarian society, which he saw as the foundation for his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create a perfect system of government, unencumbered by the traditional norms of previous societies. This allowed for the establishment of a system of self-governance that respected the natural rights of individuals, which he believed were interconnected and interdependent. He argued that if one of these rights was denied, the value of the others would be diminished, and that they should therefore be safeguarded from government interference.\n\nAccording to Taylor, the concept of the \"state of nature\" meant that those with physical strength and cunning often held power, but he believed that in a civilized society, this shouldn't be the case. To create an ideal society, he advocated for a government that acknowledged the duality of human nature, encompassing both good and evil. He was adamant that, as government is wielded by humans, all its virtues and vices must be human as well.\n\nTaylor defined good principles as those that protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage capitalism. He believed that a government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest and avarice. However, he also recognized that self-interest was a natural human trait, but it became problematic when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.\n\nTo prevent the excesses of self-interest, Taylor believed that a good government was essential, and that it must be carefully monitored to avoid the introduction of bad principles. Like many other stalwart Republicans of his time, he advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, which granted the Federal government only the powers explicitly outlined in the document. He feared that an expansive Federal government would be expensive and tyrannical, but he also believed that a literal interpretation of the Constitution could be problematic without considering the intentions of its authors.\n\nIn fact, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence to be the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation. This perspective informed his views on governance and shaped his advocacy for a limited and accountable government.",
            "In reviewing Figure 17, it's clear that there was a significant drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project, which was a bit disheartening. It's hard to pinpoint the exact reason for this decline, but some contributing factors could be the onset of winter at our New England campus, which likely reduced the number of people commuting by bicycle or on foot. Additionally, the end of the fall semester and the subsequent holiday season may have caused many students and faculty to lose sight of the commuter log submissions in the midst of their busy schedules. Furthermore, the month-long break at the end of the semester and the start of the spring semester in late January might have also contributed to the low number of submissions in those months.\n\nAs projects like ours often experience a natural ebb and flow of energy and enthusiasm, it's not entirely surprising that participation declined after the initial excitement. In response, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign aimed at revitalizing the initiative and boosting log submissions. This effort did lead to an increase in submissions for that month. Nonetheless, we still faced the challenge of maintaining momentum despite the natural decrease in engagement and the unique challenges posed by holiday and semester breaks in higher education.\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles for our project – and, arguably, any alternative commuting initiative – is the deep-seated cultural preference for driving a car and the freedom it offers. To combat this, we provided incentives in the form of gift certificates to local businesses. While these prizes seemed sufficient at first, it would be interesting to see how larger, more substantial prizes might have affected participation. For instance, offering a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car as a prize might have been a game-changer. However, we stuck to the same prize format throughout the project, and it's possible that increasing the value of the prizes over time could have helped maintain engagement and prevent the decline we saw.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, offers an incredible combination of flexibility and diversification, making it a compelling choice for savvy investors.  By tracking an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets, ETFs provide the same benefits as index funds, but also offer the freedom to trade like a stock on an exchange.  This means you can enjoy the benefits of single stock ownership, such as selling short, buying on margin, and purchasing as few as a single share in any transaction, all while still having the diversification of an index fund.  One of the biggest advantages of ETFs is their low expense ratios, which are significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund.  However, there are some downsides to consider, such as the commission you pay on each trade, just as you would with a stock. \n\nThe other benefit of ETFs is the vast array of funds available, giving you a wide range of options to choose from.  But, it's essential for any shrewd investor to carefully evaluate the benefits of an ETF, including diversification, to make sure they actually exist and to what extent.  For this exercise, we'll be focusing on the ETF IHF and examining its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF provides benefits similar to those of a diversified portfolio of the individual stocks.  We'll also investigate whether there are better configurations of the same stocks that would offer a more optimal risk-adjusted return.\n\nTo make the analysis manageable, we've narrowed our focus to the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets.  Here are the top 10 holdings and their corresponding percentages:\n\nTo get a sense of how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we can calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted entirely of these stocks in the same proportions as the ETF.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the chart below.\n\nLooking at the chart, it's clear that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings would have a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's overall Beta.  These results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could potentially provide higher returns with lower risk.  However, it's also possible that the differences between the two portfolios are not statistically significant.\n\nTo further evaluate this, we've calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% for comparison with the ETF's accumulated standard deviation.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed standout poems is \"Dream-Land.\" Poe's poem is notable for its incorporation of the word \"Thulé,\" which he uses twice as a bookend in the poem. The term \"Thulé\" is derived from Virgil, who used it to describe an island north of Britain that the ancient Greeks considered the edge of the known world. However, there's more to Poe's use of this term than meets the eye. Poe was a fan of German literature, and it's worth noting that his familiarity with Goethe's work may have played a role in his choice of this word. \n\nThis aspect of \"Dream-Land\" is significant because it highlights Poe's connection to Goethe's writing. In a book titled \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt explores the similarities between the two authors' works, suggesting that Poe was, in fact, drawing inspiration from Goethe. \n\nGoethe is also notable for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king who becomes consumed by grief after his wife's death and eventually decides to end his life by throwing a goblet into the ocean. The description of the King of Thule bears a striking resemblance to the speaker in \"Dream-Land,\" who is haunted by death and loss. The parallel between these two characters can be seen as a dark echo of Poe's own experiences and struggles. \n\nInterestingly, Goethe's work was not only influential in the literary world but also in the realm of performance. In 1842, H.P. Grattan adapted \"Faust\" into a romantic drama, which was published just a year before Poe referenced Thule in his poem \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe references Thule twice in his collected writings, once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and again in \"Dream-Land.\" Considering the similarities between \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land,\" it's possible to read these two poems as companion pieces. \n\nGoethe was a prominent author who, through his influence on Tennyson, would have been familiar to Poe. As a result, it's not surprising that Poe would have been exposed to Goethe's work, particularly in the numerous reproductions of his work that were being published at the time.",
            "Imagine a customer at a grocery store in California slipping and falling on an applesauce spill and being awarded punitive damages for the store manager's reckless behavior. The store manager was informed twice about the spill but took no action to clean it up because he was eating dinner, ignoring the risks of leaving the spill unattended. Could this be considered a serious enough offense to justify punitive damages?\n\nIn this case, a judge is unlikely to dismiss the customer's claim for punitive damages out of hand. To receive punitive damages, the customer must prove that the store manager's actions demonstrated a willful disregard for the harm that could occur from the spill, as well as despicable behavior. The customer can argue that the manager should have known about the potential harm of the spill, given that multiple customers had been injured in similar incidents at the store in the past. Furthermore, the manager failed to take steps to maintain a safe environment despite the risk, as six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the store in 2009.\n\nThe customer's argument that the manager's actions were despicable is somewhat weaker, but still reasonable considering the facts. The manager was informed of the spill not once, but twice, and still chose to ignore it because he was on dinner break. This lack of regard for customer safety is disturbing, especially given the history of accidents at the store. It is clear that the manager's actions were not just a minor oversight, but a willful disregard for the well-being of his customers.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, the store employee Rich Wayne informed the manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin dismissed the issue, saying he was on dinner break. Half an hour later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill, but he responded in the same way. By 5:30 pm, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, there had been five reported slip-and-fall incidents at the store in 2009.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation that is not related to a contract if the defendant acted with malice, oppression, or fraud. The law defines malice as conduct that was intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, was despicable and showed a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others. In this case, the manager's actions demonstrate a clear disregard for the safety of his customers, and it is likely that the court will allow the customer's claim for punitive damages to proceed.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, and a topic that sparked heated discussions back then remains relevant today: the perception of Islam as a hostile religion.  Looking back on the past decade, I've noticed a striking shift in media portrayals of Islam and extremists, from a predominantly negative view to an extreme level of tolerance in America.  The election of President Barack Obama, who has an evident Muslim heritage, is a testament to this shift.\n\nThe Life of the Prophet Muhammad has always fascinated me, but my understanding of his biography contradicts the image I had of him.  From my prior knowledge, I thought that Muhammad compelled people to convert to Islam through conquest and force.  However, the biography presents a different picture: that of a humble and misunderstood figure who was often submissive to others.  People gradually came to see the truth in his teachings and sought him out voluntarily.\n\nThe similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the purported miracles of Muhammad are also striking.  One example is when Muhammad multiplied food and drink for a group of forty men, much like the feeding of the five thousand by Jesus.  This style of writing creates a narrative that portrays Muhammad as a humble prophet who doesn't need to prove anything, but simply lives a life of truth and performs miracles.  This approach downplays the significance of Jesus' life and miracles, making it seem like they're trying to borrow from and attribute Jesus' character to Muhammad.\n\nI was also troubled by the way the biography presents stories of people's conversions to Islam as a form of proof or witness.  However, these stories often rely on secondhand or thirdhand accounts, which diminish their credibility.  This approach makes the stories seem suspicious and raises questions about the reliability of the narrative.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this biography is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure who is humble, wise, and gentle.  However, historical records contradict this image, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "As we look back at the history of Christianity, it's clear that the teachings of Jesus and the core principles he stood for were largely forgotten as the faith evolved after his lifetime.  In broader strokes, it appears that Christianity has been moving increasingly further away from its roots.  However, the world is now witnessing a growing awareness and a progressive shift in the way people think.  While traditionalists will undoubtedly resist any attempts to stray from established doctrine, their influence may not be strong enough to hinder the inevitable change.  It's likely that Christians will increasingly seek to understand the true intent of their faith, separating the original teachings of Jesus from the additional dogma that's been added over time.  It may take decades or even centuries, but history has shown that a reversal of this trend is not only possible, but inevitable.  As the clock ticks backward, layers of doctrine will be stripped away, leaving only the core principles that Jesus introduced to humanity, untainted by the influence of other thinkers.  When this trend gains momentum in the United States and Europe, it will likely be accompanied by a unifying force, with people coming together to worship in a more authentic way, guided by Jesus' original ideas.  The church will remain a guiding institution, but its influence will be tempered by a return to the simplicity and unity of Jesus' message.  We'll see a shift from diversity to uniformity, as differences between regions, denominations, and divisions are bridged by a shared understanding of the faith.  History is replete with examples of such reversals, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor to a Christian institution, and the shift from African-American slavery to leadership.  The great reversal that's on the horizon will be a return to the source, undoing the complexities of history in the process.  A key factor in this process will be the ability to interpret Jesus' words as metaphors, rather than literal statements.  Looking back, we find that the foundation of Christianity lies in Judaism, with its core principles of monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures firmly in place by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population was not unified, with various factions like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people each holding different views.",
            "In my opinion, The Jungle is a powerful reflection of humanity's inherent selfishness and lack of empathy. Deep down, many people prioritize their own well-being and success above all else, disregarding those around them. This is evident throughout the novel, particularly in the actions and attitudes of the factory owners and managers. They are solely focused on expanding and profiting from their companies, regardless of the consequences to others or the environment. Upton Sinclair vividly describes the devastating impact of their actions, such as the pollution created by the factories, which is graphically portrayed in his writing, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". This powerful imagery highlights the callous disregard for the well-being of both humans and animals affected by the factories' operations.\n\nThe owners and managers also demonstrate a blatant disregard for the welfare of their employees, viewing them as mere commodities to be exploited for profit. They prioritize their financial gains over the lives and livelihoods of their workers, often subjecting them to long hours and hazardous working conditions. The novel suggests that, in the era in which it was set, there were few regulations protecting workers' rights, allowing the factory owners to operate with impunity. This led to a system in which workers were essentially treated as slaves, with no assistance or support available to them. The union movement, which was supposed to help workers, ultimately became a source of further exploitation, preying on the desperation of those it was meant to protect. Sinclair's portrayal of this system is a scathing critique of a society that values profit over people, leading to a culture of immorality and exploitation.",
            "Many authors have mastered the art of influencing their readers' perceptions through various literary techniques. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a prime example of this, skillfully employing several methods in his novel The Great Gatsby to evoke a particular feeling or attitude towards pivotal subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others, and Fitzgerald's use of unconventional pairings of adjectives and nouns is particularly noteworthy. He often pairs words that don't typically go together, imbuing them with a distinct aura. Furthermore, Fitzgerald leverages the symbolism of colors to create a lasting impression on readers. He builds up meaning around specific colors like white, gray, and red/pink, then cleverly employs them to convey a particular sentiment about an object or character. \n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald masterfully constructs the meaning of white and gray, with white signifying a sense of refinement and higher class, while gray represents age and a faded quality. This underlying meaning is skillfully established at the beginning of the novel through repeated usage. For instance, characters like Daisy and Jordan are frequently described as wearing white, and other characters such as Nick, Tom, and Catherine also sport white attire. In fact, the only time these characters don't wear white is when Nick is observing Gatsby's party, where the atmosphere is dominated by primary colors. Fitzgerald reinforces the distinction between white and gray by applying them to everyday objects and people, like the \"white chasms of lower New York\" and the \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable. He even uses these colors to describe plain or mundane people or places, such as the \"white girlhood\" Jordan and Daisy shared, the \"gray cars\" in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray old man\" selling dogs. \n\nOnce the meaning of white and gray is solidified, Fitzgerald uses them to convey a sense of uniformity or unimportance. This technique is first evident in the way he portrays Daisy. After a period of relative absence of these colors, Fitzgerald reintroduces them in association with Daisy, describing her as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster.\" As a result, readers begin to perceive Daisy as a uniform, almost interchangeable element, something that Gatsby desires but lacks. Fitzgerald reinforces this impression by applying similar techniques to other aspects of Daisy, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her appearance in a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is renowned for its thriving agricultural scene, primarily due to its pleasant, sunny climate. A variety of crops are planted here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial in the San Diego area, with many local organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists for their products. Organic eggs and milk are also highly sought after. Several organic farms in the region offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of farm can benefit from government programs while also enhancing the habitat, allowing for recreational use and educational programs.\n\nIn addition to catering to a lucrative niche market, organic farming often brings numerous benefits, such as increased biodiversity in the area due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming can be more labor-intensive and costly in some aspects. It requires more hands-on labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses may be higher than with conventional methods. Small organic farms also lack the efficiency of large-scale operations. Furthermore, practices that benefit wildlife but are unrelated to organic farming can incur additional labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions like edge habitat or patches of open ground. Consequently, there are many reasons why a landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land chosen for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. This property is a mix of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher. Others are declining and may soon be listed, including burrowing owls.\n\nThis area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The land in question was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years.\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "In any given negotiation, culture plays a significant role in shaping the dynamics at the table. However, understanding culture can be a complex task, as it is not a fixed or uniform entity. It's essential to recognize that culture is often defined by its nuances and variations, rather than by broad generalizations. For instance, statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify the rich tapestry of cultural differences. A more productive approach is to focus on the specific cultural context and how it influences the negotiation process.\n\nWhen interacting with a foreign culture, we often find ourselves drawing comparisons to our own cultural norms. To effectively navigate these differences, it's crucial to study and appreciate the history, values, and prejudices of the culture in question. Rather than trying to change or judge the culture, it's vital to respect its boundaries and traditions, especially when in a weaker bargaining position. This approach can help break down cultural barriers and facilitate a smoother negotiation.\n\nHowever, culture is not limited to national or international distinctions. Companies within a given nation often develop their own corporate culture, which can be just as distinct as national cultures. This corporate culture can be reflected in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. The diversity of thought within a company can be striking, even from region to region or within different departments. For instance, certain companies may prioritize long working hours, while others foster a more relaxed work environment.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally essential in negotiation, as they provide the underlying motivations and drivers of a culture. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will likely avoid public conflicts or concessions. Conversely, a culture that prioritizes a hard-driven bargain may not be willing to settle at the earliest opportunity. By considering these cultural nuances, negotiators can tailor their approach to effectively engage with their counterparts and achieve their goals. Ultimately, taking the time to learn about one's opponent on a personal level can significantly enhance the negotiation process.",
            "In the Bible's Psalm 14, we find a profound quote that sets the tone for our discussion: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This phrase is also the foundation of St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God, which we will explore alongside that of Thomas Aquinas. Given that both authors are defending the same concept, we'll assume they're both correct in their belief in the God of the Bible. This allows us to compare their arguments without considering alternative deities. \n\nAlthough each author presents valid points, neither provides a comprehensive basis for believing in God. To illustrate this, let's delve into St. Anselm's argument. Anselm's passage suggests that faith is the path to understanding, and that the truth about God can be found within one's own mind. He posits that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive of his nonexistence. In essence, Anselm proposes that we don't need external evidence to prove God's existence, but rather, it's inherent in our own knowledge. This idea of accepting truth without irrefutable evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts. \n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas argues that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This approach would be beneficial in evangelism, as it would allow new converts to be persuaded by logic rather than faith. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God, much like how a missing puzzle piece can be inferred from the assembled rest of the puzzle.",
            "Somewhere in the ancient world, around the 5th or 6th century BCE, a young prince would be born who would later be known as the Buddha. Over the course of his life, he would renounce the world and achieve enlightenment, leading to the formation of Buddhism, a path that has been followed by millions of people for over 2,500 years. However, this ancient path has undergone significant changes since its inception. A prime example of this is the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed with great fervor, a tradition that wasn't even taught by the Buddha himself. This transformation is not limited to superficial practices but extends to the very core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both within the monastic and lay circles, has had to adapt its teachings over time due to various internal and external forces, both benevolent and malevolent.\n\nTo better understand this evolution, it's essential to grasp the nuances of certain terms that will be repeatedly used throughout this discussion. The terms internal and external refer to forces originating from within or outside the Buddhist community, respectively. A hostile force is any entity that seeks to harm or damage the community, often driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. On the other hand, a benign force may not intend to harm or help the community but may inadvertently do so as a byproduct. These definitions will be crucial in understanding the complex dynamics at play in the development of Theravada Buddhism.\n\nAt its core, Theravada Buddhism is built around a set of fundamental doctrines that guide its followers. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma (or the teachings), and the Sangha (the community). The Dhamma is comprised of the Tripitaka, three baskets of sacred texts: the Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the rules and regulations, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, including concepts like Anatta (the absence of a permanent self), Dukkha (the inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of all things). By recognizing these concepts, one can break free from Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, and ultimately overcome lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), which are the root causes of suffering. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for laypeople and monks alike, including the five precepts for laymen (not to kill, lie, steal, misbehave sexually, or consume intoxicating substances) and a more extensive set of rules for monks. At the heart of Buddhism lies the Four Noble Truths: first, the truth of suffering (Dukkha); second, the truth that attachment causes suffering; and third, the truth that suffering can be overcome.",
            "There's a fascinating example of an enduring rivalry between the United States and Mexico, which lasted for a whopping 57 years from 1836 to 1893. This long-standing feud reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the US emerged victorious, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own territory. Although the rivalry ebbed and flowed over the years, it finally dissipated just before World War I. The roots of this rivalry can be attributed to disagreements over fundamental issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, coupled with significant clashes of material interests, as noted by Schmitt (1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is not unique to the US-Mexico relationship. Many nations sharing a border have historically experienced similar conflicts of interest, leading to the formation of rival positions. The US and Mexico are a prime example of this phenomenon. As David M. Pletcher (1977) pointed out, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both nations are geographically close to the US and have been longstanding rivals, while other Latin American countries have enjoyed good relations with the US.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in fueling this rivalry, a common theme throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) noted that in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy, much like the ideological struggles seen in the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union (p. 86). The historical distrust between the English and Spanish also contributed to the tensions between the two nations, creating an obstacle to establishing amicable foreign relations.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), there were 17 disputes between Mexico and the US during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes centered around territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Border outlaws and bandits from American border towns posed a significant problem, which only subsided when both countries took military action to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nInterestingly, the rivalry between the US and Mexico began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in the late 19th century, as Schmitt (1974) observed (p. 109-110).",
            "It's been 15 years since a life-altering illness struck me out of the blue, leaving me unexpectedly disabled. I was 46 years old, single, and a nurse at the time, having chosen my profession as a safe haven from the uncertainty of my childhood. People had often reassured me that I would always be able to find work, as everyone gets sick, and that mantra echoed in my mind as I pursued a career in nursing, even though my true ambitions lay in becoming a scientist or a journalist.\n\nHowever, fate had other plans. After 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I've lost everything that I once considered mine. Each day is a struggle, a constant assault on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. The one thing that I can be certain of is that I wouldn't have made it this far without the unwavering support of my family and a few close friends. They've been my lifeline, and I'm deeply grateful for their presence in my life.\n\nMy point is that life is unpredictable, and emergencies can strike at any moment, big or small. No matter how prepared we think we are, some challenges are too great to face alone. I strongly believe that instead of relying solely on big government, Americans should learn to trust and help one another, to ask for assistance when needed, rather than becoming isolated and fend-for-themselves.\n\nThe idea of rugged individualism, often touted by Conservatives, glosses over the fact that our forefathers' resilience in hard times was not solely due to their self-reliance, but rather their compassion, mutual respect, and willingness to share resources. The pioneers who braved the treacherous terrain in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast alone; they relied on each other for support.\n\nOf course, being prepared is essential, and I've taken steps to ensure my readiness. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and more. But beyond that, I believe it's equally important to foster a sense of community. Get to know your neighbors, build relationships, and be willing to lend a helping hand. It's not about being self-sufficient at all costs; it's about being part of a network that supports and uplifts one another.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in the way they do has long been a subject of debate. Many experts believe that there are certain restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change. While scientists have made significant progress in understanding the mechanisms of evolution, there is still much to be discovered. In fact, as D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917, \"the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" Recent studies have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk development, including ontogeny and phylogeny. Our research is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help us understand the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell, which allowed us to create hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. Our results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a better understanding of macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a three-dimensional structure that spirals through 360 degrees of space over time. The individual turns or revolutions of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which are thought to spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis, called the columella, runs through the central column of the shell. The rate at which the whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, known as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last whorl, or body whorl. The spire is composed of all the whorls except the last one. The tip of the spire is called the apex, while the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The most common orientation of a shell is an apertural view, where the aperture is facing the viewer and the apex is pointing upwards.\n\nWhen counting whorls, it's essential to view the shell from the apical view and identify the first suture. A line can be drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls can be counted from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal grows and builds its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture, we can use coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture to graphically and mathematically represent the shell's trajectory. Once we have a mathematical formulation, we can modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis by varying parameters.",
            "Despite making progress in various areas, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have stagnated over the past decade.  While the country is on track to meet some of the Millennium Development Goals, such as improving access to water and sanitation, its child and maternal health targets are still a long way off from being met by 2015.  Several factors are contributing to these shortcomings, which highlight the need to strengthen the overall healthcare system rather than solely focusing on individual programs.\n\nOne area where Indonesia has seen improvement is in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% of births now meeting this standard.  However, this category includes traditional workers such as midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complicated pregnancies and are therefore contributing to a high number of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage.  As a result, the progress made in this area may be misleading, and there is still much work to be done.  Furthermore, the percentage of children under five treated for diarrheal diseases by a healthcare professional has declined, and data on postnatal care is incomplete, indicating that this area also requires attention.\n\nThe rate of cesarean sections is still lower than expected, at around 4%.  This rate also highlights another concern - the disparity in access to healthcare services across the country.  While urban areas have a c-section rate of 7%, rural areas have a much lower rate of 2%.  This disparity points to a lack of equity in service coverage, with access to healthcare services concentrated in urban areas.  Another issue is vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor face significant barriers to accessing healthcare services due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the question is whether Indonesia should focus on developing program-specific approaches or strengthening the overall health system without prioritizing pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children.  While programmatic approaches can be attractive due to their targeted objectives and potential for quick results, there are also some drawbacks to consider.  Investing heavily in one area of the health sector can divert resources from other areas, causing human resources to shift towards more resourced sectors, such as the HIV/AIDS sector, at the expense of other areas like family planning.  Additionally, running multiple parallel programs in one area can lead to duplication of services and uncoordinated efforts, resulting in increased paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "One of the most notable characteristics of Victorian literature is the meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, two novels that deviate from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both of these works incorporate elements of mystery and an unconventional flair, setting them apart from the typical Victorian novels. This unique approach serves to deepen the characters within each story, offering valuable insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\nIn the midst of turmoil, the protagonist's mind becomes overwhelmed with a cacophony of thoughts. He finds himself caught in a chaotic melee, reliving a heated argument between Sikes and Crackit, who were disputing fiercely. As he struggles to focus, the sounds of gunfire and the cries of others pierce the air, and he's suddenly whisked away by an unseen force. Throughout this chaotic sequence, a gnawing sense of pain persists, tormenting him relentlessly.\n\nBoth novels employ dream sequences and dreamlike states to convey this sense of mystery. In Oliver Twist, these eerie occurrences often shed light on Oliver's inner turmoil, revealing the depths of his emotional pain and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. When Oliver re-experiences the shooting in Chapter 28, he relives it vividly, as if in a dream, while desperately seeking help. The passage highlights the sense of helplessness that Oliver feels, as if he's lost control over the events unfolding around him. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit underscore the dire circumstances that have befallen him, leaving him numb and crippled by fear. This shooting serves to reinforce the notion that Oliver has little control over his life, as he's unable to take charge, even in the face of impending danger. This growing sense of defeat is also implied, as if Fagin's influence has begun to break him, forcing him to accept his despair and rendering him powerless to react.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, a similar atmosphere of foreboding pervades the narrative. As the day wears on, it seems to vanish as quickly as it arrives, replaced by an endless and oppressive night, filled with an eerie silence that's both haunting and fleeting.",
            "A few years ago, I had the opportunity to work in an after-school program, where I helped Elementary age students with their studies, focusing on English and reading. One student, a boy named Adrian, really stood out, as he was having trouble reading. I was brought in to help him, and I soon realized that something was off - he had a peculiar problem with reading certain letters. It turned out that he spoke perfect English, but he didn't know the English alphabet that well. This was a surprising discovery, and it dawned on me that the language barrier is a complex issue that's often not as obvious as we think.\n\nThis experience made me realize that even a child who speaks perfect English can struggle with reading. I want to use this story to highlight the problem of the language barrier in schools, particularly in California. I think we can all agree that this is a significant issue. So, what's the solution? In Adrian's case, the answer was simple: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complicated.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these solutions on their own will fix the problem. The key lies in combining them. The dual language system, for instance, has been shown to be effective. Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically. Some people may be hesitant to implement this system, thinking it's a waste of resources or that only a minority of students will benefit. But that's not true. If we made bilingual education the norm, rather than the exception, all children would benefit from it.\n\nSo, how do we make this work? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic and unreasonable. However, I do think that we can have bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, to support our students. By combining these different approaches, we can create a more effective solution to the language barrier in our schools.",
            "As kids, many of us are taught that there's something greater than us out there, something we can't fully comprehend.  Some of us attend Sunday school, while others visit the Temple or delve into our own inner selves for answers.  A lot of us simply accept the faith our parents passed down to us, but others flat-out reject it, doubting that there's anything beyond our own personal bubble.  We may adopt one set of values, only to later swap them out for another.  No matter the path we choose, we strive to find our own unique perspective on spirituality, our own guiding light in the darkness.  We're searching for something to lead us out of the shadows and into the light.\n\nOne time, I asked my dad about his favorite bird, and he mentioned cardinals.  We were sitting on our porch, listening to the rain pound against the tin roof above us, the gutters bringing it down and drowning the plants along the edge.  He was staring off into the rain, a mix of searching and remembering in his gaze.  He'd lost weight over the past few months, and his clothes hung loosely on his frame.  His hair was thinner, sparser too.  I felt a sense of isolation, fear, and desperation – I couldn't bring myself to talk to him about how much I'd miss him, because that would've made it all too real.  I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in gazing out into the rain, our June twilight fading away.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had prolonged his life a bit, but it was a pointless suffering – I couldn't figure out what the point was.  As I lay there, alone at night, I stopped praying.  If God existed, I thought, he'd stopped listening to me a long time ago. \n\nI didn't want to watch my dad slip away.  I didn't want to see the man who created me fade into nothingness.  I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not by how he died.  I knew my dad better than anyone else did – I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to be a spectator at his passing.  For three days, I curled up in a ball, waiting for the news.\n\nBut no one even called me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is an intriguing oxymoron, as suggested by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. It represents a paradoxical blend of the old and the new. The Gothic mode has been subjected to varying degrees of praise and criticism, with some viewing it as lacking substance and others appreciating its ability to evoke a sense of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew inspiration from both ancient and modern romance, thus launching the proto-Gothic genre and introducing a novel style of literary expression. By merging 'old' theatrical elements and 'new' narrative techniques, Walpole created a unique literary experience he termed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). Gothic literature is characterized by its reliance on medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, which were already perceived as archaic and unsophisticated at the time of the novel's publication. However, the fusion of the theatrical and the novel's personal narrative allowed Gothic literature to endure and remain relevant despite its perceived obsolescence.\n\nOne of the key elements of the Gothic genre is the concept of chivalry, which was deeply rooted in medieval tradition. The original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, retains and reinterprets the idea of chivalry, highlighting the idealized characteristics of the classic knight – bravery, honor, and competence. Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, drew on this concept to criticize the perceived decline of these values in their own society. By romanticizing the 'gothic past,' they aimed to improve the present and hint at the future evolution of Gothic literature into Romanticism. This is evident in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, such as his status as a prince, his experience of suffering, and his supposed martyrdom at the hands of infidels. The description of Frederic is replete with traditionally chivalric imagery, including his gallantry and courtesy, which serves to exaggerate the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "The supply chain management process is a complex series of steps that involves the movement of goods from the raw materials stage all the way to the final customer. The term supply chain management was coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a renowned consultant. According to Keith Oliver, the goal of supply chain management is to create an efficient and effective process that meets customers' needs quickly and effectively. There are six key components to a well-oiled supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. By mastering these six elements, business managers can deliver top-notch customer service.\n\nFirst and foremost, production is the foundation of the supply chain process. It's the starting point where everything begins, and it's crucial to get it right. Managers need to know what customers want, and to figure that out, they need to analyze the market and understand customer demand. From there, they can decide what products to produce, how many to make, and where to produce them, all while keeping customer satisfaction in mind. Effective production planning is essential, as every detail counts. I've seen firsthand how important it is to have a solid plan in place, having worked at retail giants like Wal-Mart and Target. Both companies have detailed blueprints for every aspect of the business, from employee uniform layout to receiving shipments from trucks. Having a clear plan helps prevent confusion and ensures that everything runs smoothly.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply. This refers to the strategic decisions made to determine a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Managers need to decide which divisions of production are best suited for each product and whether to outsource certain tasks to other companies. The goal is to achieve velocity – the ability to deliver quality, flexibility, and low costs. By streamlining processes and making smart outsourcing decisions, companies can stay ahead of the competition and meet customer demands.",
            "People passing by can't help but take a glance at the stark message scrawled on Ellen Page's makeshift sign. The actress, known for her role in Juno, stands alone on a street corner, a poignant reminder of the country of Burma, now known as Myanmar, where a ruthless military junta has ruled with an iron fist since 1962. The junta's brutal takeover was a mere coup d'état, yet it has had a profound impact on the country's history. Fast forward to 2007, when a wave of street protests swept the nation, marking the first public demonstrations in a decade. Led by a large contingent of Burmese monks, these protests were dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the distinctive color of their robes. However, the peaceful gatherings soon turned violent, with the military junta clashing with the monks and foreign journalists getting caught in the crossfire. The death toll, officially reported to be 13, may be a gross understatement, with defected Colonel Hla Win estimating that the actual number of fatalities could be several thousand.\n\nThis is a tragic yet all-too-familiar tale of a government cracking down on dissent and silencing its citizens. It's a phenomenon that has been evident throughout history, with power-hungry leaders dating back to the early Roman emperors declaring themselves divine rulers. The Japanese emperors, supposedly gods sent to guide their people, are another example, as are more recent instances like the Tiananmen Square protests in China, where thousands lost their lives in a brutal crackdown. The Rwandan genocide and Hitler's 'Third Reich' are other chilling examples of governments showing no qualms about brutal suppression of their citizens.\n\nIt's a sobering reminder that the quest for power and control has been a perpetual thorn in humanity's side since the dawn of civilization. We would do well to remember these dark chapters in our history and strive for a world where freedom of speech and assembly are cherished, not crushed.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz can be attributed to his ability to produce innovative compositions over several decades. As a pianist, Ellington frequently played a subtle role in the arrangements for this assignment, but as a composer, he excelled at crafting complex pieces that showcased the talents of individual band members. By creating a framework where soloists could freely improvise, Ellington combined tightly orchestrated pieces with phrases that highlighted each musician's unique style, ultimately shaping the tone of the orchestra as a whole. This approach enabled him to write some of the most groundbreaking and exceptional pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's use of voice as a jazz instrument, exemplified in \"Creole Love Call,\" an early piece from his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues showcases Ellington's ability to incorporate voice without the constraints of lyrics, adding texture and color to the music. The song's structure is evident in its six choruses, which demonstrate Ellington's skill in complementing his soloists' styles.\n\nIn \"Creole Love Call,\" each chorus presents a unique interpretation of the melody, from the initial call-and-response between voice and reeds to the muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody. The sweeping clarinet solo and full-band echo of the first chorus further showcase Ellington's ability to balance contrasting elements. The climactic fifth chorus features a call-and-response exchange between reeds and brass, backed by syncopated stop-time from the rhythm section. Finally, the sixth chorus returns to the first chorus's structure, with the voice adopting the \"growl\" technique and soloing as an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a tone color enhancer is a hallmark of his compositional style. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year after \"Creole Love Call,\" he combines his mastery of orchestration with a keen ear for tone color. The call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound. Similarly, in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to great effect, introducing the melody in a way that showcases his unique style.",
            "She couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness that had been plaguing her since she was 14. It was a void that she couldn't quite put her finger on, and it had been lingering for three years, despite her growing into her teenage years. As she entered her late teens, she found herself searching for something more substantial than material things. Yet, despite being in her early 17, she hadn't found anyone who piqued her interest. She often found herself wondering what could be causing this peculiar phenomenon in a teenage girl. Her theories and contemplations over the years had yielded nothing concrete, leaving her questioning her own desires.\n\nIn her daily life, she was fortunate to have a peaceful and loving family environment. Her parents were calm and level-headed, hardly ever disagreeing with each other, and rarely clashing with their daughter. The only time they would argue was when she tried to assert her independence and free-spirited nature, which often put her at odds with their more reserved personalities. Today, however, was not a typical day. As she wandered from room to room in search of inspiration, she was startled by a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen, followed by her mother's frantic voice. Panicked, she rushed into the room to find her mother lying on the ground, writhing in pain and repeating \"Ow\" in short, pained gasps. Her daughter rushed to her side and took her hand, trying to offer assistance. \"Mom, what's wrong?\" she asked, her voice laced with concern. \"I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother gasped, her words rushed and labored. Her daughter quickly sprang into action, helping her mother to the car and driving her to the hospital.\n\nUpon arrival, the hospital's familiar scents of disinfectant and antiseptic hit her, but her focus remained on helping her mother. She quickly called for medical attention and sat anxiously as the doctors and nurses rushed to attend to her mother's injuries. It turned out that her mother had fallen off a stepping stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to investigate the relationship between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality. The study focused on a modified version of the Med diet, known as the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet\", which features higher consumption of plant foods, monounsaturated fats, and fish, as well as lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake was also allowed.\n\nPrevious research has demonstrated an inverse association between Med diet adherence and total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, with one study showing the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, prior studies did not specifically examine the relationship between Med diet adherence and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nA prospective cohort study involving 74,886 women aged 38-63, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states, was conducted. The study spanned 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, during which time the authors calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) six times. Over 95% of the nurses remained in the study throughout this period. The FFQs were validated, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical records, hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo minimize individual variability and capture long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated, averaging scores from two prior years. The authors controlled for potential confounders, including age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe results showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe economic downturn, marked by high unemployment, a crumbling housing market, and the downfall of several major corporations. This prolonged recession has raised crucial questions: how did this crisis unfold, and what steps can we take to prevent it from happening again? In a nutshell, the financial crisis was sparked by reckless and uninformed decision-making by politicians that led banks and companies to issue sub-prime loans into a fragile financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were coerced into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into complex securities, which ultimately led to a chain reaction of financial chaos. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left scrambling, transferring the fallout onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold and on to the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis date back to the late 1990s, when President Clinton was seeking re-election. To boost his popularity, his administration relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the impending sub-prime crisis seven years later. New York Times journalist Steven Holmes reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the country's largest mortgage underwriter, was under intense pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand lending to low- and moderate-income borrowers, while also meeting shareholder expectations for high profits.\" Holmes astutely predicted the consequences of these actions: \"However, the government-subsidized corporation might encounter trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to the savings and loan industry crisis of the 1980s.\" As outlined earlier, these ill-conceived lending practices would ultimately lead to a catastrophic economic collapse.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the increasingly complex mortgage system. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were overused in the years leading up to the crisis, entangling various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets becoming severely over-indebted and vulnerable to even minor changes in housing prices. The housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities reeling. By 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, representing around 30% of the country's GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at rock-bottom prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transform into commercial banks subject to strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie were saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "You know that part in your story where you let your writer's imagination run wild and take flight, only to risk losing your readers to a sea of unnecessary details? That's what I'm talking about - the dreaded exposition. It's the section where your readers' eyes glaze over, and they're secretly hitting the \"Back\" button on their browser. Dr. Merlin, for one, has been known to mutter to herself at the screen when she finds herself bogged down in too much information - and not in the fun way.\n\nExposition can be a major pitfall for writers. Even those who know the mantra \"Show, don't tell\" can still fall into the trap of lengthy passages that don't advance the plot. It's like having two devils on your shoulder: one telling you to get the backstory out of the way so you can get to the good stuff, and the other urging you to share every last detail about your characters' childhoods.\n\nSo, what exactly is exposition? It's the process of telling your audience what happened, often in straightforward language. Think of it like a film's info dump, where one character lays out a whole chunk of backstory to another. In fiction, it's when the author does the telling rather than showing.\n\nLet's take an example. Imagine you're reading a story, and the heroine is telling you that she met her beloved at such-and-such a place and time, got married in a fancy ceremony, and then her husband was tragically murdered in front of her. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, would you? You'd expect the author to flesh out the husband's character, showing how much he loved his wife through his words and actions. Similarly, you'd expect the heroine to reveal her feelings about him through her thoughts, words, and actions. This would help you connect with her on a deeper level and mourn her loss when her husband dies.\n\nIn short, you want to add meat to the bare bones of the storyline. Instead of just telling your readers \"They met, they married, he died,\" you want to give them a richer understanding of the characters and their relationship. As a writer, it's your job to provide that depth. So, the next time you're tempted to rush through a scene, remember: a little exposition can go a long way, but too much can leave your readers yawning.",
            "I recently watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio, and my observations have left me with some thoughts. The first one was NBC 4's live broadcast on August 13, 2011. The lead story was about a disturbing incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife. The news team showed his mug shot, and his expression seemed sinister. Although the story was still developing, I think they allocated the right amount of time to it, around two minutes. The details provided were limited to his arrest and the fact that he stabbed his wife multiple times.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting that left Travis Buyers, 18, critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. Despite the severity of the incident, no arrests had been made at the time, and no suspects were identified. I couldn't help but notice that the story seemed rushed, and I believe it might be a result of the fact that the victim was a young black man from a predominantly black neighborhood. I've observed a pattern over the years where crimes committed by minority victims are often glossed over or receive less attention than those committed against white victims. If a white person were in a similar situation, the media would likely devote more time and attention to the story. The stark contrast is striking.\n\nThe next story covered the discovery of a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. The news team provided some details about the location of the incident and the type of bullet used. A .22 caliber bullet from a rifle was identified as the cause of the damage, and Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe forecast for the weekend was also covered, with temperatures predicted to remain in the mid to low eighties. The segment was relatively short, but it seemed like a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nAnother story reported on a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie and a sweatshirt. I found it interesting that the news team devoted an unusual amount of time to emphasizing his racial characteristics. \n\nLastly, a story highlighted the case of Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas-based drug kingpin who had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana in Ohio. I couldn't help but wonder why the news team chose to mention his ethnicity, as it seemed irrelevant to the story. The use of the term \"300 months\" instead of \"25 years\" also caught my attention, and I'm not sure what the reasoning behind it was.",
            "There's a bond between brothers – an unbreakable, unshakeable connection that transcends even the deepest of emotions. Within that bond, a complex web of feelings unfolds: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, to name a few. Brothers have a unique understanding of one another, a connection that can only be truly grasped by those who've experienced it firsthand. When things take a turn for the worse, the true nature of this bond shines through, whether it's love, loyalty, or malevolence. These emotions come with a hefty price tag, but they also offer a glimpse into one's true character. When you look into your brother's eyes, you see a reflection of yourself, not as others see you, but as you truly are. Your actions and their consequences are where your true character lies.\n\nThis theme is beautifully explored in James Hurst's short story, \"The Scarlet Ibis.\" Two brothers navigate the ups and downs of this bond, with all the associated emotions that come with it. Against the backdrop of a lush, vivid landscape, their journey is a poignant exploration of the human experience. Bitter disappointment clashes with overwhelming pride in a heart-wrenching climax, and only one brother escapes unscathed. Through the protagonist's direct characterization and interactions with his brother, Doodle, as well as the narrator's insightful perspective, the complex emotions that shape their world are expertly conveyed.\n\nAt the heart of the story is the protagonist's complicated relationship with his brother. He had envisioned a partner to share in his adventures, someone to join him in exploring the world. Instead, he's faced with a brother who's fragile and vulnerable. His resentment and frustration are palpable, especially when he recalls his initial disappointment and frustration with Doodle's condition. He had expected a brother who could keep up with him, but Doodle's limitations were a harsh reality check. Even so, the protagonist's anger and frustration are tempered by moments of tenderness, like when Doodle smiles at him. This shows that, deep down, he genuinely cares for his brother.\n\nThe story raises important questions about the nature of brotherhood and the complex emotions that come with it. Through the protagonist's experiences, we see that the bond between brothers is multifaceted and far-reaching, capable of inspiring both love and cruelty. It's a powerful reminder that our actions have consequences, and it's through these consequences that we come to understand our true character.",
            "The human brain is a complex and dynamic information-processing system.  As technology has advanced from ancient to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also undergone significant changes. People have initially compared the brain to a simple wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently to a computer. However, it's essential to keep in mind that these metaphors have their limitations and can lead to incorrect conclusions. \n\nWhen sensory organs process external stimuli, they convert them into electrical signals. This information is then processed and transformed repeatedly through the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing methods. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing gathers fundamental information such as color, orientation, and where the object's borders are, ultimately deciding that it's a box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, uses previously made decisions to accelerate box recognition. It might, for instance, help identify the object as a black box rather than a hole in the white background.\n\nOnce processed to some extent, a selective filter determines the signal's importance and which cognitive processes should be made available to it. It's the same as how you can focus on your name being spoken in a noisy room, while ignoring individual blades of grass when you look down. There are many stages of processing, and the results are constantly modulated by attention.\n\nFor the brain to process and store information, it must first be stored. There are several types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with different encoding methods applicable to various sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded based on its structural appearance, sound, or meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Research suggests that working memory, which stores information for around 20 seconds, is maintained through an electrical signal circulating through a series of neurons for a short time. On the other hand, long-term memory is believed to be maintained through the structure of specific proteins.\n\nThere are various models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human subjects' memory retrieval patterns, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts, with connections between them based on their relatedness. For instance, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In his novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley paints a dire picture of a future society where technology and capitalism have merged to create a dystopia. In this world, people are conditioned to prioritize community over individuality and instant gratification above all else. The citizens are essentially pawns in a game controlled by the World Controller, with their every move dictated by a strict ideology. Through the lens of Marxist ideas, it's clear that Huxley was warning us about the dangers of emerging systems in his time. He uses terms like homogeny and reification, characteristic of Marxist thought, to show how people are essentially trapped in a system that suppresses their true potential.\n\nHuxley critiques capitalism by using the concept of false consciousness, where the common person is kept from understanding the true nature of their relationships with other classes in economic terms. They're focused on their own self-interest, oblivious to the manipulation by the World Controller. The lower classes, represented by Delta and Gamma, are conditioned to be driven by their desires for consumption and indulgence, making them unaware of the manipulation. This is a perfect example of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over others. The upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, are aware of the manipulation but don't do much to challenge it, further solidifying the oppressive nature of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are superficial and lacking in depth. This could be a commentary on how the rise of technology and capitalism erodes our free will and emotions. Love and extreme emotions are non-existent, replaced by shallow interactions and objectification of others. The fact that characters like Bernard, who are aware of the system, don't challenge it further highlights the complacency of the society. This is a clear indication of the Marxist idea that the proletariat are conditioned to believe they're superior as long as they conform and continue to consume.\n\nBy examining Brave New World through a Marxist lens, it's clear that Huxley was warning us about the dangers of a society where people are controlled by a dominant ideology. His use of Marxist terminology and concepts shows that he saw the emerging systems of his time as a threat to individual freedom and autonomy.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for almost three years now, having completed close to five semesters. For many of us, getting around campus can be a challenge. My freshman year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, which is about as far east as you can get on campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The commute from my Stuart Hall home to classes in buildings like the Willard building, located near the heart of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather's bad – and bad weather is common in State College. Speaking with an alum who's not much older than me, I learned that the East Halls dorms used to be isolated from the rest of the campus by large areas of unused land. Today, those empty spaces have been filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments, including the Creamery and a new health services building. As our campus continues to grow, navigating the campus becomes increasingly difficult. So, what's the solution to this mobility issue? On a college campus, the answer is clear: the bicycle. However, having a bike alone won't solve the problem. We need to ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nRecently, I had a conversation with a friend who recently started riding a bike again after a few-year hiatus. He told me that he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Besides being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. With a bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical exertion, you can cover 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was buying a bike. Every day, I have classes in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, but it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or not. Walking has its benefits, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That's over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on. That's more time than I can spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day!

            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "My career ambition is to pursue an occupation in social work, specifically with the Division of Family and Children Services, to make a positive difference in the lives of children who have been abused or neglected and to offer support to struggling families. The core values that will guide my professional development in this field include a commitment to service, respect, an unwavering commitment to ethics, a dedication to enhancing relationships between individuals, and a continuous striving for professional growth and competence.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been a driving force in my life, and I was initially uncertain about the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my high school and college years, I witnessed many individuals struggling with their problems, some using coping mechanisms that weren't ideal, and others turning a blind eye to their issues. These experiences led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Although I still hadn't determined my ideal career path, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. A pivotal encounter with a friend's 16-year-old friend, who was escaping an abusive home life, prompted me to consider a career in social work. I realized that my degree in Psychology could be used to make a tangible difference in the lives of those who needed it most. I soon found myself visiting the teenager's parents' house, where I expressed my concerns to the police and offered to speak with the parents. This experience crystallized my resolve to pursue a career in social work, where I can help children and families navigate complex family dynamics.\n\nSocial justice is another value that is deeply ingrained in me, and I believe it's essential for the social work profession. As a society, we often claim to value individuality, but our actions often contradict this sentiment. We mourn the loss of individuals, yet we strive to conform to societal norms and expectations. I, on the other hand, celebrate my uniqueness and refuse to be bound by arbitrary limitations. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively protested against social injustice whenever possible: expressing my individuality through bold fashion choices, speaking out against racism and discrimination, and participating in social justice movements like the GSBA. I will continue to champion social justice and stand up against injustice in all its forms.",
            "Insomnia, a sleep disorder that affects millions, has been a topic of interest in both the biological and sociocultural realms.  The biological model sheds light on the genetic and physiological factors that contribute to insomnia, while the sociocultural model explores the environmental influences that impact sleep patterns. This review will delve into the biological and sociocultural models of insomnia, examining the research that underlies each and critiquing their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders related to other mental health issues, or sleep disorders caused by medical conditions or substance intake. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias, such as Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and others, which affect an individual's ability to initiate and maintain sleep. On the other hand, Parasomnias, like Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder, are characterized by behavioral and physiological abnormalities during sleep.\n\nThe biological model focuses on the genetic and physiological aspects of insomnia, with research indicating that neurons in the hypothalamus play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states, and activating the GABAA receptor promotes sleep. Conversely, inhibiting this receptor can lead to reduced anxiety and increased sleep time. These findings suggest that genetic and environmental factors contribute to the physical GABAB receptor in humans, and abnormalities in this receptor may affect an individual's ability to sleep without medication.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study are significant, as inherited genetic traits can regulate sleep patterns, and alterations to the receptor can disturb sleep, impacting daily life activities. This highlights the importance of understanding the biological underpinnings of insomnia and how they intersect with environmental factors, such as demographics, socioeconomic status, and cultural background.\n\nBy examining the biological and sociocultural models of insomnia, researchers and healthcare professionals can better understand the complexities of this sleep disorder and develop more effective treatments. A comprehensive approach that takes into account both biological and environmental factors is essential for addressing the multifaceted nature of insomnia.",
            "This paper delves into the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, a concise explanation of the disorder is provided. Following this, the diagnosis process is explored, highlighting common characteristics that serve as warning signs. Lastly, the paper concludes by discussing ways in which a teacher in a mainstream classroom setting can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's inefficiency in processing auditory information. In essence, the central nervous system (CNS) struggles to interpret and differentiate sounds, making it challenging for individuals with CAPD to distinguish words, conversations, and background noise. Unlike those with hearing impairments, people with CAPD can hear normally, but the area of the brain responsible for sound processing is not functioning as it should.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has its roots in the 1950s, when it was initially referred to as \"auditory imperception.\" Researchers, including the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began developing tests to identify children with communicative disorders in the mid-1950s. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiological mechanisms underlying dichotic perception.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways, including difficulties with sound localization, distinguishing between multiple auditory events, recognizing sound patterns, and differentiating changes in speech. Additionally, individuals with CAPD may experience auditory masking, where one sound is blocked by a subsequent sound, or struggle to synthesize sound clues to interpret them meaningfully. They may also have trouble determining the sequence of auditory information presented to them.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a thorough evaluation is required, involving systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals use various measures to assess auditory-related skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors. There is no single, consistently effective tool or test for diagnosing CAPD, and its causes remain unknown. Advanced tests may involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "It seems that the play Twelfth Night suggests that while a disguise can be a useful tool for deception, it can ultimately lead to a loss of identity if it is not shed. However, abandoning a deception can also result in alienation. This creates a difficult decision for the individual, who must weigh the importance of self-preservation against the preservation of relationships with others. Some people may not take kindly to being deceived, and may feel offended by the charade. \n\nThe theme of deception in the context of gender role reversal is particularly problematic, as it raises questions about the motivations behind such behavior. In the case of Viola, her decision to disguise herself as a man is a form of self-protection in a foreign land. However, this approach also isolates her from the support system of women around her. Her convincing portrayal of a man even leads Olivia to confuse her with her twin brother Sebastian, causing her to fall in love with Viola. This adds to the complexity of Viola's situation, as she also struggles with suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino. \n\nWhile Twelfth Night may seem progressive in its portrayal of unexpressed emotions, it can also be seen as highlighting the ways in which deception can lead to the revelation of hidden desires, as seen in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may have subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario based on his masculine appearance, or does she genuinely harbor feelings for women? It is likely that Olivia is satirizing the people of her time who judge others based on appearance alone, as evidenced by her swift shift in romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian.",
            "I've always thought that the German colonial empire was a complex beast, with policies and ruling styles as varied as its geography. While it's often noted for its brutal aspects, such as the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa, it's clear that the empire's educational provisions were just as diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a population of educated and literate Africans, which was a stark contrast to what they would find in other colonies. For instance, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were praised by contemporary authors, but the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) was a far cry from these successes. Unlike in East Africa, where the government took a leading role in education, in South West Africa the task of educating the natives was left largely to missionary societies, which received limited government support. This had significant and lasting effects on the colony.\n\nOne of the key factors that contributed to these divergent experiences was the presence of a large settler population in South West Africa. This is a point that Cohen's study highlights, comparing the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa. According to Cohen, the relatively temperate climate and large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of its educational system. With nearly 15,000 whites living in South West Africa by 1913, compared to just 5,336 in East Africa, it's clear that the colonial authorities in South West Africa had a different set of priorities. While they invested in state schools and supported missionary schools for European settlers, the native population was largely left to fend for themselves. The result was that \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" This legacy of neglect continues to shape the region to this day, and it's a fascinating topic of study.\n\nIn terms of existing literature, there's a wealth of research on education in the German colonial empire, most of which is in German and from the early twentieth century. While these early sources provide valuable insights into the features of educational systems in different colonies, later studies in English have expanded the discourse, offering comparative analyses of education in the various German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific aspects of education. Cohen's study is a standout in this regard, providing a nuanced understanding of the factors that contributed to the divergent experiences of South West Africa and East Africa.",
            "The world of popular music has undergone a significant transformation over the past hundred years, evolving into a vast array of genres that seem to have no end. To make matters more complex, many of these genres have spawned their own sub and sub-sub genres, leaving it challenging to provide an exhaustive list. However, one genre that has managed to stand out in the past four decades is Heavy Metal rock, which has become a melting pot of diverse and expressive styles.\n\nHeavy Metal's expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, predominantly the darker aspects of human experience. The genre's diversity, on the other hand, is a result of its flexibility, which allowed musicians to experiment and create their own unique sub-genres. Over time, this process has continued, resulting in a multitude of niches that make it difficult to define what Heavy Metal truly is.\n\nToday, Heavy Metal has evolved to incorporate elements from other genres, yet its roots remain a mystery. To truly comprehend the vast array of Metal music that surrounds us, one must first grasp the essence of the Metal movement and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nAt its core, Metal is a movement defined by darkness – a \"music of more\" that features louder volumes, more intensity, and a greater emphasis on theatricality. Metal musicians are known for their exceptional skill and technical prowess, which is evident in their music. Moreover, Metal's history is deeply intertwined with the world of psychedelia, with the mid-70s drug boom playing a significant role in shaping the genre. Many iconic Metal bands drew inspiration from the darker, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era, resulting in lyrics that reflect the genre's affinity for the darker aspects of human emotion.\n\nTake, for instance, the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter,\" a song that has been cited as one of the first Heavy Metal tracks. Its lyrics, which explore the ups and downs of a supposed psychedelic experience, demonstrate the genre's affinity for the darker side of human experience. This song was, in part, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker sound, with the Beatles seeking to prove that they could rival their peers in terms of intensity.",
            "A few decades before Surrealist artists started bringing their dreamlike works to life, Henri Rousseau was quietly crafting his own dreams – both in his paintings and in his imagination. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only captures a woman's awe at the wonders of the fantastical land she visits in her dreams, but also reflects Rousseau's own dreams and aspirations as a painter. For years, he longed to be recognized, accepted, and praised by his fellow artists and art enthusiasts. However, he faced a tough inner struggle: should he conform to established styles to gain acceptance or stay true to his unique vision and forge his own path?\n\nTo understand The Dream, it's essential to know a bit about Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, Henri grew up in a relatively comfortable household with a father who was a successful tinsmith and hardware dealer. Despite his comfortable upbringing, Rousseau received no formal art training and instead worked for the French government as a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, until he was 40. The nickname that stuck, douanier (customs inspector), was a far cry from his true passion – painting. After the loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children, Rousseau found solace in art, hoping it would bring him comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries, who sentimentalized and romanticized the peasant in their paintings, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of the average person.\n\nGiven his circumstances, it's no wonder Rousseau yearned for recognition from the art world. He was an older artist starting his career at a time when many talented and well-known modern artists were already established. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse began gaining recognition that Rousseau started to receive the accolades he deserved. According to Jan Gordon in his book Modern French Painters, Rousseau and Matisse were distinct not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for creating art: while Matisse sought to avoid painting in a conventional manner, Rousseau aimed to create a picture so conventional that it would earn him acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "Many influential thinkers have long argued that there's a profound connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. In my opinion, this connection stems from a fundamental aspect that ties them together. As John Keats so eloquently puts it in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We often learn various aspects of life through education or personal experiences, but our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to be derived from a different source, as Keats suggests. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe, rather than dictate. Our studies of morality and beauty are primarily attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nIn essence, criticism of art or morals can never fully grasp the essence of what's good or beautiful. Discussing the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might center around concepts like foreground, background, or cultural context, but these aspects don't capture why it's considered good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like \"There's just something about it\" before providing a more complex explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor so astutely observes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe a work of literature, there's always something transcendent left untouched. Similarly, I propose that ethics has this same quality. As Wittgenstein aptly notes, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this \"something\", this je ne sais quoi, is what makes art and morality so powerful, and this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\nIn my opinion, morality and art are closely related because we experience both at a deep, noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be felt, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to literature, an art form that stands out due to its unique moral quality, as McKean notes. He argues that, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a strong and unified country with a unique blend of culture that spans from the picturesque Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This rich culture is also evident in cities like Cologne on the Rhine River, the heart of Germany, and the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. It's no surprise that Germany's identity is shaped by its complex history and the diverse tribes that have influenced its development over time. \n\nThe origins of the name \"Germania\" are shrouded in mystery, with scholars and historians debating its true meaning. Some attribute it to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe mentioned by the Roman historian Tacitus. According to him, they were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine River and clashed with the Gaulish forces. Julius Caesar, who first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, believed it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In his writings, Caesar noted that the Germans lived beyond the Rhine River and were constantly at war with the Gauls. Others speculate that the name \"German\" comes from the spear used in warfare, known as a \"ger\" in Old English, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which might indicate the Germans were a loud and boisterous people.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote extensively about the origins of the Germans in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum.\" He described the Germans as an aboriginal people, untouched by other cultures through immigration or interaction. According to Tacitus, only those who were driven by desperation would leave their homes in Asia or Africa to venture into the harsh and unforgiving landscape of Germany. The Romans, for their part, were content to trade with the Germanic tribes and occasionally launch military campaigns into their territory, but they rarely settled there.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and skills with the Romans in exchange for their military service. The Germans' reputation as fierce warriors and skilled traders was well-known throughout the ancient world, shaping the course of European history for centuries to come.",
            "As I stood there, my gaze drifted downwards, taking in the scene before me, but my mind remained blank, unwilling to grasp the significance of what I was seeing. It was as if I was observing it all from a detached perspective, without any emotional connection. My thoughts flitted in and out of my consciousness, fleeting and ephemeral, never really taking hold. My mental processes hummed along, efficient and smooth, creating a seamless experience, but devoid of any real introspection.\n\nI recalled a conversation with an artist I had worked with, who recommended an instructional book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had long been fascinated by drawing, ever since I was a child, and this book promised to teach me the fundamentals. One technique it highlighted was to frame a picture with a square, stripping away extraneous details and reducing it to its essence. I had always been overwhelmed by the complexity of the world around me, and I longed to capture its beauty.\n\nAt that moment, staring at the bowl of food in front of me, I couldn't even imagine applying that artist's perspective. I was too caught up in the sheer magnitude of what I was seeing. I felt like I was stumbling upon a masterpiece, the start of something magnificent. I had always admired the works of Picasso, Monet, and the Renaissance masters, each with their own unique style and vision. If I was to consider myself an artist, this could be the beginning of my own masterpiece, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand hovered over the pencil, and for a moment, I felt the urge to create. My muscles tensed, and my hand began to move, but instead of sketching, I was gripping the toilet handle. The water swirled, serene and smooth, but the brown package remained stuck. I stood there, frowning, my green tie constricting my neck, as I gazed at the mess someone had left behind. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and then I reached for the toilet paper, my hand instinctively wrapping itself like a mitten. I stood up straight, bent at the waist, and slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, as if I was approaching a sacred ritual, or perhaps a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "The alarming trend of teenage drivers behind the wheel is a grave concern in the United States.  Several factors contribute to this devastating statistic, and one key reason is the fact that the teen brain is not yet fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Inexperience is another crucial factor, which not only leads to fatal accidents but also increases the risk of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.  To make matters worse, teenagers are more likely to engage in reckless behavior when they're driving with their peers, a disturbing trend that is all too common.  According to the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, there's a clear correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents that occur.\n\nIn an effort to address this issue, many states have implemented provisional licenses that restrict the hours teens can drive and prohibit other minors from being passengers.  However, I believe these measures are merely a temporary fix.  The root problem lies in the fact that, as a group, the youngest drivers are not yet capable of handling the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that even at 18, many individuals are still prone to thrill-seeking behavior, making it essential to delay the granting of regular driver's licenses until this tendency has subsided.  If we continue to issue licenses to young teens, the number of fatal accidents will likely skyrocket, especially when the Baby Boomer babies reach driving age and millions of new teen drivers hit the road by 2010. \n\nA sensible solution to this issue would involve schools continuing to provide driver's education classes to prepare future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 would be allowed to operate a vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full driver's license, along with a set number of practical driver's training hours, such as the 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult currently required in California.  Uniform, national legislation addressing this issue would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country.  This idea is not new, but it's a crucial step towards preventing the staggering number of teen driving fatalities that will surely occur if we fail to act.",
            "I spent some time browsing through the Library of Congress's early film collection and decided to watch all 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films rely heavily on creative editing to create illusions. My study of these films primarily focused on understanding the poetic techniques used in most of them and analyzing the unique characteristics of a few of the later films that broke free from traditional norms. It's worth noting that most trick films from this era are set-bound, shot from a frontal proscenium, feature no camera movement, and stick to the one shot = one film concept, but there were a few exceptions that dared to challenge these conventions.\n\nOne of the most notable similarities among the trick films is their use of interior sets within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary and does not move to follow characters or objects, a style that originated from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. This method has a limitation, however, as figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, never walking towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, never leaving the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also means that most shots are long shots, with medium shots appearing less frequently. Close-up shots are completely absent in these early Edison films, drawing from the theatre and vaudeville tradition where the audience sees the entire performance at a time, framed by the stage borders. As with most early films, the actors do not approach the camera, so close-ups are nonexistent.\n\nIn general, most early trick films follow the pattern of one conceptual shot equalling a film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also restricts the use of tricks in storytelling, with most films focusing on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts. However, closer inspection reveals that a single \"shot\" can actually be composed of multiple joined shots to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where a more detailed look reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a true champion of Republicanism, and his dedication to this cause was evident in both his agricultural pursuits and his brief foray into politics. As a result, he became known for his unwavering commitment to personal freedoms and government accountability. His views on governance were deeply rooted in his beliefs about the importance of an agrarian society, which he saw as the foundation for his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create a perfect system of government, unencumbered by the traditional norms of previous societies. This allowed for the establishment of a system of self-governance that respected the natural rights of individuals, which he believed were interconnected and interdependent. He argued that if one of these rights was denied, the value of the others would be diminished, and that they should therefore be safeguarded from government interference.\n\nAccording to Taylor, the concept of the \"state of nature\" meant that those with physical strength and cunning often held power, but he believed that in a civilized society, this shouldn't be the case. To create an ideal society, he advocated for a government that acknowledged the duality of human nature, encompassing both good and evil. He was adamant that, as government is wielded by humans, all its virtues and vices must be human as well.\n\nTaylor defined good principles as those that protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage capitalism. He believed that a government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest and avarice. However, he also recognized that self-interest was a natural human trait, but it became problematic when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.\n\nTo prevent the excesses of self-interest, Taylor believed that a good government was essential, and that it must be carefully monitored to avoid the introduction of bad principles. Like many other stalwart Republicans of his time, he advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, which granted the Federal government only the powers explicitly outlined in the document. He feared that an expansive Federal government would be expensive and tyrannical, but he also believed that a literal interpretation of the Constitution could be problematic without considering the intentions of its authors.\n\nIn fact, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence to be the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation. This perspective informed his views on governance and shaped his advocacy for a limited and accountable government.",
            "In reviewing Figure 17, it's clear that there was a significant drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project, which was a bit disheartening. It's hard to pinpoint the exact reason for this decline, but some contributing factors could be the onset of winter at our New England campus, which likely reduced the number of people commuting by bicycle or on foot. Additionally, the end of the fall semester and the subsequent holiday season may have caused many students and faculty to lose sight of the commuter log submissions in the midst of their busy schedules. Furthermore, the month-long break at the end of the semester and the start of the spring semester in late January might have also contributed to the low number of submissions in those months.\n\nAs projects like ours often experience a natural ebb and flow of energy and enthusiasm, it's not entirely surprising that participation declined after the initial excitement. In response, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign aimed at revitalizing the initiative and boosting log submissions. This effort did lead to an increase in submissions for that month. Nonetheless, we still faced the challenge of maintaining momentum despite the natural decrease in engagement and the unique challenges posed by holiday and semester breaks in higher education.\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles for our project – and, arguably, any alternative commuting initiative – is the deep-seated cultural preference for driving a car and the freedom it offers. To combat this, we provided incentives in the form of gift certificates to local businesses. While these prizes seemed sufficient at first, it would be interesting to see how larger, more substantial prizes might have affected participation. For instance, offering a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car as a prize might have been a game-changer. However, we stuck to the same prize format throughout the project, and it's possible that increasing the value of the prizes over time could have helped maintain engagement and prevent the decline we saw.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, offers an incredible combination of flexibility and diversification, making it a compelling choice for savvy investors.  By tracking an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets, ETFs provide the same benefits as index funds, but also offer the freedom to trade like a stock on an exchange.  This means you can enjoy the benefits of single stock ownership, such as selling short, buying on margin, and purchasing as few as a single share in any transaction, all while still having the diversification of an index fund.  One of the biggest advantages of ETFs is their low expense ratios, which are significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund.  However, there are some downsides to consider, such as the commission you pay on each trade, just as you would with a stock. \n\nThe other benefit of ETFs is the vast array of funds available, giving you a wide range of options to choose from.  But, it's essential for any shrewd investor to carefully evaluate the benefits of an ETF, including diversification, to make sure they actually exist and to what extent.  For this exercise, we'll be focusing on the ETF IHF and examining its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF provides benefits similar to those of a diversified portfolio of the individual stocks.  We'll also investigate whether there are better configurations of the same stocks that would offer a more optimal risk-adjusted return.\n\nTo make the analysis manageable, we've narrowed our focus to the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets.  Here are the top 10 holdings and their corresponding percentages:\n\nTo get a sense of how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we can calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted entirely of these stocks in the same proportions as the ETF.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the chart below.\n\nLooking at the chart, it's clear that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings would have a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's overall Beta.  These results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could potentially provide higher returns with lower risk.  However, it's also possible that the differences between the two portfolios are not statistically significant.\n\nTo further evaluate this, we've calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% for comparison with the ETF's accumulated standard deviation.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed standout poems is \"Dream-Land.\" Poe's poem is notable for its incorporation of the word \"Thulé,\" which he uses twice as a bookend in the poem. The term \"Thulé\" is derived from Virgil, who used it to describe an island north of Britain that the ancient Greeks considered the edge of the known world. However, there's more to Poe's use of this term than meets the eye. Poe was a fan of German literature, and it's worth noting that his familiarity with Goethe's work may have played a role in his choice of this word. \n\nThis aspect of \"Dream-Land\" is significant because it highlights Poe's connection to Goethe's writing. In a book titled \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt explores the similarities between the two authors' works, suggesting that Poe was, in fact, drawing inspiration from Goethe. \n\nGoethe is also notable for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king who becomes consumed by grief after his wife's death and eventually decides to end his life by throwing a goblet into the ocean. The description of the King of Thule bears a striking resemblance to the speaker in \"Dream-Land,\" who is haunted by death and loss. The parallel between these two characters can be seen as a dark echo of Poe's own experiences and struggles. \n\nInterestingly, Goethe's work was not only influential in the literary world but also in the realm of performance. In 1842, H.P. Grattan adapted \"Faust\" into a romantic drama, which was published just a year before Poe referenced Thule in his poem \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe references Thule twice in his collected writings, once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and again in \"Dream-Land.\" Considering the similarities between \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land,\" it's possible to read these two poems as companion pieces. \n\nGoethe was a prominent author who, through his influence on Tennyson, would have been familiar to Poe. As a result, it's not surprising that Poe would have been exposed to Goethe's work, particularly in the numerous reproductions of his work that were being published at the time.",
            "Imagine a customer at a grocery store in California slipping and falling on an applesauce spill and being awarded punitive damages for the store manager's reckless behavior. The store manager was informed twice about the spill but took no action to clean it up because he was eating dinner, ignoring the risks of leaving the spill unattended. Could this be considered a serious enough offense to justify punitive damages?\n\nIn this case, a judge is unlikely to dismiss the customer's claim for punitive damages out of hand. To receive punitive damages, the customer must prove that the store manager's actions demonstrated a willful disregard for the harm that could occur from the spill, as well as despicable behavior. The customer can argue that the manager should have known about the potential harm of the spill, given that multiple customers had been injured in similar incidents at the store in the past. Furthermore, the manager failed to take steps to maintain a safe environment despite the risk, as six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the store in 2009.\n\nThe customer's argument that the manager's actions were despicable is somewhat weaker, but still reasonable considering the facts. The manager was informed of the spill not once, but twice, and still chose to ignore it because he was on dinner break. This lack of regard for customer safety is disturbing, especially given the history of accidents at the store. It is clear that the manager's actions were not just a minor oversight, but a willful disregard for the well-being of his customers.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, the store employee Rich Wayne informed the manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin dismissed the issue, saying he was on dinner break. Half an hour later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill, but he responded in the same way. By 5:30 pm, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, there had been five reported slip-and-fall incidents at the store in 2009.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation that is not related to a contract if the defendant acted with malice, oppression, or fraud. The law defines malice as conduct that was intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, was despicable and showed a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others. In this case, the manager's actions demonstrate a clear disregard for the safety of his customers, and it is likely that the court will allow the customer's claim for punitive damages to proceed.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, and a topic that sparked heated discussions back then remains relevant today: the perception of Islam as a hostile religion.  Looking back on the past decade, I've noticed a striking shift in media portrayals of Islam and extremists, from a predominantly negative view to an extreme level of tolerance in America.  The election of President Barack Obama, who has an evident Muslim heritage, is a testament to this shift.\n\nThe Life of the Prophet Muhammad has always fascinated me, but my understanding of his biography contradicts the image I had of him.  From my prior knowledge, I thought that Muhammad compelled people to convert to Islam through conquest and force.  However, the biography presents a different picture: that of a humble and misunderstood figure who was often submissive to others.  People gradually came to see the truth in his teachings and sought him out voluntarily.\n\nThe similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the purported miracles of Muhammad are also striking.  One example is when Muhammad multiplied food and drink for a group of forty men, much like the feeding of the five thousand by Jesus.  This style of writing creates a narrative that portrays Muhammad as a humble prophet who doesn't need to prove anything, but simply lives a life of truth and performs miracles.  This approach downplays the significance of Jesus' life and miracles, making it seem like they're trying to borrow from and attribute Jesus' character to Muhammad.\n\nI was also troubled by the way the biography presents stories of people's conversions to Islam as a form of proof or witness.  However, these stories often rely on secondhand or thirdhand accounts, which diminish their credibility.  This approach makes the stories seem suspicious and raises questions about the reliability of the narrative.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this biography is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure who is humble, wise, and gentle.  However, historical records contradict this image, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "As we look back at the history of Christianity, it's clear that the teachings of Jesus and the core principles he stood for were largely forgotten as the faith evolved after his lifetime.  In broader strokes, it appears that Christianity has been moving increasingly further away from its roots.  However, the world is now witnessing a growing awareness and a progressive shift in the way people think.  While traditionalists will undoubtedly resist any attempts to stray from established doctrine, their influence may not be strong enough to hinder the inevitable change.  It's likely that Christians will increasingly seek to understand the true intent of their faith, separating the original teachings of Jesus from the additional dogma that's been added over time.  It may take decades or even centuries, but history has shown that a reversal of this trend is not only possible, but inevitable.  As the clock ticks backward, layers of doctrine will be stripped away, leaving only the core principles that Jesus introduced to humanity, untainted by the influence of other thinkers.  When this trend gains momentum in the United States and Europe, it will likely be accompanied by a unifying force, with people coming together to worship in a more authentic way, guided by Jesus' original ideas.  The church will remain a guiding institution, but its influence will be tempered by a return to the simplicity and unity of Jesus' message.  We'll see a shift from diversity to uniformity, as differences between regions, denominations, and divisions are bridged by a shared understanding of the faith.  History is replete with examples of such reversals, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor to a Christian institution, and the shift from African-American slavery to leadership.  The great reversal that's on the horizon will be a return to the source, undoing the complexities of history in the process.  A key factor in this process will be the ability to interpret Jesus' words as metaphors, rather than literal statements.  Looking back, we find that the foundation of Christianity lies in Judaism, with its core principles of monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures firmly in place by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population was not unified, with various factions like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people each holding different views.",
            "In my opinion, The Jungle is a powerful reflection of humanity's inherent selfishness and lack of empathy. Deep down, many people prioritize their own well-being and success above all else, disregarding those around them. This is evident throughout the novel, particularly in the actions and attitudes of the factory owners and managers. They are solely focused on expanding and profiting from their companies, regardless of the consequences to others or the environment. Upton Sinclair vividly describes the devastating impact of their actions, such as the pollution created by the factories, which is graphically portrayed in his writing, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". This powerful imagery highlights the callous disregard for the well-being of both humans and animals affected by the factories' operations.\n\nThe owners and managers also demonstrate a blatant disregard for the welfare of their employees, viewing them as mere commodities to be exploited for profit. They prioritize their financial gains over the lives and livelihoods of their workers, often subjecting them to long hours and hazardous working conditions. The novel suggests that, in the era in which it was set, there were few regulations protecting workers' rights, allowing the factory owners to operate with impunity. This led to a system in which workers were essentially treated as slaves, with no assistance or support available to them. The union movement, which was supposed to help workers, ultimately became a source of further exploitation, preying on the desperation of those it was meant to protect. Sinclair's portrayal of this system is a scathing critique of a society that values profit over people, leading to a culture of immorality and exploitation.",
            "Many authors have mastered the art of influencing their readers' perceptions through various literary techniques. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a prime example of this, skillfully employing several methods in his novel The Great Gatsby to evoke a particular feeling or attitude towards pivotal subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others, and Fitzgerald's use of unconventional pairings of adjectives and nouns is particularly noteworthy. He often pairs words that don't typically go together, imbuing them with a distinct aura. Furthermore, Fitzgerald leverages the symbolism of colors to create a lasting impression on readers. He builds up meaning around specific colors like white, gray, and red/pink, then cleverly employs them to convey a particular sentiment about an object or character. \n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald masterfully constructs the meaning of white and gray, with white signifying a sense of refinement and higher class, while gray represents age and a faded quality. This underlying meaning is skillfully established at the beginning of the novel through repeated usage. For instance, characters like Daisy and Jordan are frequently described as wearing white, and other characters such as Nick, Tom, and Catherine also sport white attire. In fact, the only time these characters don't wear white is when Nick is observing Gatsby's party, where the atmosphere is dominated by primary colors. Fitzgerald reinforces the distinction between white and gray by applying them to everyday objects and people, like the \"white chasms of lower New York\" and the \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable. He even uses these colors to describe plain or mundane people or places, such as the \"white girlhood\" Jordan and Daisy shared, the \"gray cars\" in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray old man\" selling dogs. \n\nOnce the meaning of white and gray is solidified, Fitzgerald uses them to convey a sense of uniformity or unimportance. This technique is first evident in the way he portrays Daisy. After a period of relative absence of these colors, Fitzgerald reintroduces them in association with Daisy, describing her as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster.\" As a result, readers begin to perceive Daisy as a uniform, almost interchangeable element, something that Gatsby desires but lacks. Fitzgerald reinforces this impression by applying similar techniques to other aspects of Daisy, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her appearance in a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is renowned for its thriving agricultural scene, primarily due to its pleasant, sunny climate. A variety of crops are planted here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial in the San Diego area, with many local organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists for their products. Organic eggs and milk are also highly sought after. Several organic farms in the region offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of farm can benefit from government programs while also enhancing the habitat, allowing for recreational use and educational programs.\n\nIn addition to catering to a lucrative niche market, organic farming often brings numerous benefits, such as increased biodiversity in the area due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming can be more labor-intensive and costly in some aspects. It requires more hands-on labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses may be higher than with conventional methods. Small organic farms also lack the efficiency of large-scale operations. Furthermore, practices that benefit wildlife but are unrelated to organic farming can incur additional labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions like edge habitat or patches of open ground. Consequently, there are many reasons why a landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land chosen for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. This property is a mix of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher. Others are declining and may soon be listed, including burrowing owls.\n\nThis area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The land in question was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years.\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "In any given negotiation, culture plays a significant role in shaping the dynamics at the table. However, understanding culture can be a complex task, as it is not a fixed or uniform entity. It's essential to recognize that culture is often defined by its nuances and variations, rather than by broad generalizations. For instance, statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify the rich tapestry of cultural differences. A more productive approach is to focus on the specific cultural context and how it influences the negotiation process.\n\nWhen interacting with a foreign culture, we often find ourselves drawing comparisons to our own cultural norms. To effectively navigate these differences, it's crucial to study and appreciate the history, values, and prejudices of the culture in question. Rather than trying to change or judge the culture, it's vital to respect its boundaries and traditions, especially when in a weaker bargaining position. This approach can help break down cultural barriers and facilitate a smoother negotiation.\n\nHowever, culture is not limited to national or international distinctions. Companies within a given nation often develop their own corporate culture, which can be just as distinct as national cultures. This corporate culture can be reflected in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. The diversity of thought within a company can be striking, even from region to region or within different departments. For instance, certain companies may prioritize long working hours, while others foster a more relaxed work environment.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally essential in negotiation, as they provide the underlying motivations and drivers of a culture. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will likely avoid public conflicts or concessions. Conversely, a culture that prioritizes a hard-driven bargain may not be willing to settle at the earliest opportunity. By considering these cultural nuances, negotiators can tailor their approach to effectively engage with their counterparts and achieve their goals. Ultimately, taking the time to learn about one's opponent on a personal level can significantly enhance the negotiation process.",
            "In the Bible's Psalm 14, we find a profound quote that sets the tone for our discussion: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This phrase is also the foundation of St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God, which we will explore alongside that of Thomas Aquinas. Given that both authors are defending the same concept, we'll assume they're both correct in their belief in the God of the Bible. This allows us to compare their arguments without considering alternative deities. \n\nAlthough each author presents valid points, neither provides a comprehensive basis for believing in God. To illustrate this, let's delve into St. Anselm's argument. Anselm's passage suggests that faith is the path to understanding, and that the truth about God can be found within one's own mind. He posits that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive of his nonexistence. In essence, Anselm proposes that we don't need external evidence to prove God's existence, but rather, it's inherent in our own knowledge. This idea of accepting truth without irrefutable evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts. \n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas argues that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This approach would be beneficial in evangelism, as it would allow new converts to be persuaded by logic rather than faith. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God, much like how a missing puzzle piece can be inferred from the assembled rest of the puzzle.",
            "Somewhere in the ancient world, around the 5th or 6th century BCE, a young prince would be born who would later be known as the Buddha. Over the course of his life, he would renounce the world and achieve enlightenment, leading to the formation of Buddhism, a path that has been followed by millions of people for over 2,500 years. However, this ancient path has undergone significant changes since its inception. A prime example of this is the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed with great fervor, a tradition that wasn't even taught by the Buddha himself. This transformation is not limited to superficial practices but extends to the very core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both within the monastic and lay circles, has had to adapt its teachings over time due to various internal and external forces, both benevolent and malevolent.\n\nTo better understand this evolution, it's essential to grasp the nuances of certain terms that will be repeatedly used throughout this discussion. The terms internal and external refer to forces originating from within or outside the Buddhist community, respectively. A hostile force is any entity that seeks to harm or damage the community, often driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. On the other hand, a benign force may not intend to harm or help the community but may inadvertently do so as a byproduct. These definitions will be crucial in understanding the complex dynamics at play in the development of Theravada Buddhism.\n\nAt its core, Theravada Buddhism is built around a set of fundamental doctrines that guide its followers. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma (or the teachings), and the Sangha (the community). The Dhamma is comprised of the Tripitaka, three baskets of sacred texts: the Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the rules and regulations, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, including concepts like Anatta (the absence of a permanent self), Dukkha (the inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of all things). By recognizing these concepts, one can break free from Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, and ultimately overcome lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), which are the root causes of suffering. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for laypeople and monks alike, including the five precepts for laymen (not to kill, lie, steal, misbehave sexually, or consume intoxicating substances) and a more extensive set of rules for monks. At the heart of Buddhism lies the Four Noble Truths: first, the truth of suffering (Dukkha); second, the truth that attachment causes suffering; and third, the truth that suffering can be overcome.",
            "There's a fascinating example of an enduring rivalry between the United States and Mexico, which lasted for a whopping 57 years from 1836 to 1893. This long-standing feud reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the US emerged victorious, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own territory. Although the rivalry ebbed and flowed over the years, it finally dissipated just before World War I. The roots of this rivalry can be attributed to disagreements over fundamental issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, coupled with significant clashes of material interests, as noted by Schmitt (1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is not unique to the US-Mexico relationship. Many nations sharing a border have historically experienced similar conflicts of interest, leading to the formation of rival positions. The US and Mexico are a prime example of this phenomenon. As David M. Pletcher (1977) pointed out, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both nations are geographically close to the US and have been longstanding rivals, while other Latin American countries have enjoyed good relations with the US.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in fueling this rivalry, a common theme throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) noted that in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy, much like the ideological struggles seen in the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union (p. 86). The historical distrust between the English and Spanish also contributed to the tensions between the two nations, creating an obstacle to establishing amicable foreign relations.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), there were 17 disputes between Mexico and the US during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes centered around territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Border outlaws and bandits from American border towns posed a significant problem, which only subsided when both countries took military action to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nInterestingly, the rivalry between the US and Mexico began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in the late 19th century, as Schmitt (1974) observed (p. 109-110).",
            "It's been 15 years since a life-altering illness struck me out of the blue, leaving me unexpectedly disabled. I was 46 years old, single, and a nurse at the time, having chosen my profession as a safe haven from the uncertainty of my childhood. People had often reassured me that I would always be able to find work, as everyone gets sick, and that mantra echoed in my mind as I pursued a career in nursing, even though my true ambitions lay in becoming a scientist or a journalist.\n\nHowever, fate had other plans. After 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I've lost everything that I once considered mine. Each day is a struggle, a constant assault on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. The one thing that I can be certain of is that I wouldn't have made it this far without the unwavering support of my family and a few close friends. They've been my lifeline, and I'm deeply grateful for their presence in my life.\n\nMy point is that life is unpredictable, and emergencies can strike at any moment, big or small. No matter how prepared we think we are, some challenges are too great to face alone. I strongly believe that instead of relying solely on big government, Americans should learn to trust and help one another, to ask for assistance when needed, rather than becoming isolated and fend-for-themselves.\n\nThe idea of rugged individualism, often touted by Conservatives, glosses over the fact that our forefathers' resilience in hard times was not solely due to their self-reliance, but rather their compassion, mutual respect, and willingness to share resources. The pioneers who braved the treacherous terrain in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast alone; they relied on each other for support.\n\nOf course, being prepared is essential, and I've taken steps to ensure my readiness. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and more. But beyond that, I believe it's equally important to foster a sense of community. Get to know your neighbors, build relationships, and be willing to lend a helping hand. It's not about being self-sufficient at all costs; it's about being part of a network that supports and uplifts one another.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in the way they do has long been a subject of debate. Many experts believe that there are certain restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change. While scientists have made significant progress in understanding the mechanisms of evolution, there is still much to be discovered. In fact, as D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917, \"the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" Recent studies have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk development, including ontogeny and phylogeny. Our research is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help us understand the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell, which allowed us to create hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. Our results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a better understanding of macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a three-dimensional structure that spirals through 360 degrees of space over time. The individual turns or revolutions of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which are thought to spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis, called the columella, runs through the central column of the shell. The rate at which the whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, known as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last whorl, or body whorl. The spire is composed of all the whorls except the last one. The tip of the spire is called the apex, while the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The most common orientation of a shell is an apertural view, where the aperture is facing the viewer and the apex is pointing upwards.\n\nWhen counting whorls, it's essential to view the shell from the apical view and identify the first suture. A line can be drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls can be counted from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal grows and builds its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture, we can use coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture to graphically and mathematically represent the shell's trajectory. Once we have a mathematical formulation, we can modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis by varying parameters.",
            "Despite making progress in various areas, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have stagnated over the past decade.  While the country is on track to meet some of the Millennium Development Goals, such as improving access to water and sanitation, its child and maternal health targets are still a long way off from being met by 2015.  Several factors are contributing to these shortcomings, which highlight the need to strengthen the overall healthcare system rather than solely focusing on individual programs.\n\nOne area where Indonesia has seen improvement is in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% of births now meeting this standard.  However, this category includes traditional workers such as midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complicated pregnancies and are therefore contributing to a high number of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage.  As a result, the progress made in this area may be misleading, and there is still much work to be done.  Furthermore, the percentage of children under five treated for diarrheal diseases by a healthcare professional has declined, and data on postnatal care is incomplete, indicating that this area also requires attention.\n\nThe rate of cesarean sections is still lower than expected, at around 4%.  This rate also highlights another concern - the disparity in access to healthcare services across the country.  While urban areas have a c-section rate of 7%, rural areas have a much lower rate of 2%.  This disparity points to a lack of equity in service coverage, with access to healthcare services concentrated in urban areas.  Another issue is vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor face significant barriers to accessing healthcare services due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the question is whether Indonesia should focus on developing program-specific approaches or strengthening the overall health system without prioritizing pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children.  While programmatic approaches can be attractive due to their targeted objectives and potential for quick results, there are also some drawbacks to consider.  Investing heavily in one area of the health sector can divert resources from other areas, causing human resources to shift towards more resourced sectors, such as the HIV/AIDS sector, at the expense of other areas like family planning.  Additionally, running multiple parallel programs in one area can lead to duplication of services and uncoordinated efforts, resulting in increased paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "One of the most notable characteristics of Victorian literature is the meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, two novels that deviate from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both of these works incorporate elements of mystery and an unconventional flair, setting them apart from the typical Victorian novels. This unique approach serves to deepen the characters within each story, offering valuable insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\nIn the midst of turmoil, the protagonist's mind becomes overwhelmed with a cacophony of thoughts. He finds himself caught in a chaotic melee, reliving a heated argument between Sikes and Crackit, who were disputing fiercely. As he struggles to focus, the sounds of gunfire and the cries of others pierce the air, and he's suddenly whisked away by an unseen force. Throughout this chaotic sequence, a gnawing sense of pain persists, tormenting him relentlessly.\n\nBoth novels employ dream sequences and dreamlike states to convey this sense of mystery. In Oliver Twist, these eerie occurrences often shed light on Oliver's inner turmoil, revealing the depths of his emotional pain and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. When Oliver re-experiences the shooting in Chapter 28, he relives it vividly, as if in a dream, while desperately seeking help. The passage highlights the sense of helplessness that Oliver feels, as if he's lost control over the events unfolding around him. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit underscore the dire circumstances that have befallen him, leaving him numb and crippled by fear. This shooting serves to reinforce the notion that Oliver has little control over his life, as he's unable to take charge, even in the face of impending danger. This growing sense of defeat is also implied, as if Fagin's influence has begun to break him, forcing him to accept his despair and rendering him powerless to react.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, a similar atmosphere of foreboding pervades the narrative. As the day wears on, it seems to vanish as quickly as it arrives, replaced by an endless and oppressive night, filled with an eerie silence that's both haunting and fleeting.",
            "A few years ago, I had the opportunity to work in an after-school program, where I helped Elementary age students with their studies, focusing on English and reading. One student, a boy named Adrian, really stood out, as he was having trouble reading. I was brought in to help him, and I soon realized that something was off - he had a peculiar problem with reading certain letters. It turned out that he spoke perfect English, but he didn't know the English alphabet that well. This was a surprising discovery, and it dawned on me that the language barrier is a complex issue that's often not as obvious as we think.\n\nThis experience made me realize that even a child who speaks perfect English can struggle with reading. I want to use this story to highlight the problem of the language barrier in schools, particularly in California. I think we can all agree that this is a significant issue. So, what's the solution? In Adrian's case, the answer was simple: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complicated.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these solutions on their own will fix the problem. The key lies in combining them. The dual language system, for instance, has been shown to be effective. Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically. Some people may be hesitant to implement this system, thinking it's a waste of resources or that only a minority of students will benefit. But that's not true. If we made bilingual education the norm, rather than the exception, all children would benefit from it.\n\nSo, how do we make this work? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic and unreasonable. However, I do think that we can have bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, to support our students. By combining these different approaches, we can create a more effective solution to the language barrier in our schools.",
            "As kids, many of us are taught that there's something greater than us out there, something we can't fully comprehend.  Some of us attend Sunday school, while others visit the Temple or delve into our own inner selves for answers.  A lot of us simply accept the faith our parents passed down to us, but others flat-out reject it, doubting that there's anything beyond our own personal bubble.  We may adopt one set of values, only to later swap them out for another.  No matter the path we choose, we strive to find our own unique perspective on spirituality, our own guiding light in the darkness.  We're searching for something to lead us out of the shadows and into the light.\n\nOne time, I asked my dad about his favorite bird, and he mentioned cardinals.  We were sitting on our porch, listening to the rain pound against the tin roof above us, the gutters bringing it down and drowning the plants along the edge.  He was staring off into the rain, a mix of searching and remembering in his gaze.  He'd lost weight over the past few months, and his clothes hung loosely on his frame.  His hair was thinner, sparser too.  I felt a sense of isolation, fear, and desperation – I couldn't bring myself to talk to him about how much I'd miss him, because that would've made it all too real.  I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in gazing out into the rain, our June twilight fading away.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had prolonged his life a bit, but it was a pointless suffering – I couldn't figure out what the point was.  As I lay there, alone at night, I stopped praying.  If God existed, I thought, he'd stopped listening to me a long time ago. \n\nI didn't want to watch my dad slip away.  I didn't want to see the man who created me fade into nothingness.  I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not by how he died.  I knew my dad better than anyone else did – I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to be a spectator at his passing.  For three days, I curled up in a ball, waiting for the news.\n\nBut no one even called me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is an intriguing oxymoron, as suggested by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. It represents a paradoxical blend of the old and the new. The Gothic mode has been subjected to varying degrees of praise and criticism, with some viewing it as lacking substance and others appreciating its ability to evoke a sense of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew inspiration from both ancient and modern romance, thus launching the proto-Gothic genre and introducing a novel style of literary expression. By merging 'old' theatrical elements and 'new' narrative techniques, Walpole created a unique literary experience he termed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). Gothic literature is characterized by its reliance on medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, which were already perceived as archaic and unsophisticated at the time of the novel's publication. However, the fusion of the theatrical and the novel's personal narrative allowed Gothic literature to endure and remain relevant despite its perceived obsolescence.\n\nOne of the key elements of the Gothic genre is the concept of chivalry, which was deeply rooted in medieval tradition. The original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, retains and reinterprets the idea of chivalry, highlighting the idealized characteristics of the classic knight – bravery, honor, and competence. Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, drew on this concept to criticize the perceived decline of these values in their own society. By romanticizing the 'gothic past,' they aimed to improve the present and hint at the future evolution of Gothic literature into Romanticism. This is evident in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, such as his status as a prince, his experience of suffering, and his supposed martyrdom at the hands of infidels. The description of Frederic is replete with traditionally chivalric imagery, including his gallantry and courtesy, which serves to exaggerate the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "The supply chain management process is a complex series of steps that involves the movement of goods from the raw materials stage all the way to the final customer. The term supply chain management was coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a renowned consultant. According to Keith Oliver, the goal of supply chain management is to create an efficient and effective process that meets customers' needs quickly and effectively. There are six key components to a well-oiled supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. By mastering these six elements, business managers can deliver top-notch customer service.\n\nFirst and foremost, production is the foundation of the supply chain process. It's the starting point where everything begins, and it's crucial to get it right. Managers need to know what customers want, and to figure that out, they need to analyze the market and understand customer demand. From there, they can decide what products to produce, how many to make, and where to produce them, all while keeping customer satisfaction in mind. Effective production planning is essential, as every detail counts. I've seen firsthand how important it is to have a solid plan in place, having worked at retail giants like Wal-Mart and Target. Both companies have detailed blueprints for every aspect of the business, from employee uniform layout to receiving shipments from trucks. Having a clear plan helps prevent confusion and ensures that everything runs smoothly.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply. This refers to the strategic decisions made to determine a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Managers need to decide which divisions of production are best suited for each product and whether to outsource certain tasks to other companies. The goal is to achieve velocity – the ability to deliver quality, flexibility, and low costs. By streamlining processes and making smart outsourcing decisions, companies can stay ahead of the competition and meet customer demands.",
            "People passing by can't help but take a glance at the stark message scrawled on Ellen Page's makeshift sign. The actress, known for her role in Juno, stands alone on a street corner, a poignant reminder of the country of Burma, now known as Myanmar, where a ruthless military junta has ruled with an iron fist since 1962. The junta's brutal takeover was a mere coup d'état, yet it has had a profound impact on the country's history. Fast forward to 2007, when a wave of street protests swept the nation, marking the first public demonstrations in a decade. Led by a large contingent of Burmese monks, these protests were dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the distinctive color of their robes. However, the peaceful gatherings soon turned violent, with the military junta clashing with the monks and foreign journalists getting caught in the crossfire. The death toll, officially reported to be 13, may be a gross understatement, with defected Colonel Hla Win estimating that the actual number of fatalities could be several thousand.\n\nThis is a tragic yet all-too-familiar tale of a government cracking down on dissent and silencing its citizens. It's a phenomenon that has been evident throughout history, with power-hungry leaders dating back to the early Roman emperors declaring themselves divine rulers. The Japanese emperors, supposedly gods sent to guide their people, are another example, as are more recent instances like the Tiananmen Square protests in China, where thousands lost their lives in a brutal crackdown. The Rwandan genocide and Hitler's 'Third Reich' are other chilling examples of governments showing no qualms about brutal suppression of their citizens.\n\nIt's a sobering reminder that the quest for power and control has been a perpetual thorn in humanity's side since the dawn of civilization. We would do well to remember these dark chapters in our history and strive for a world where freedom of speech and assembly are cherished, not crushed.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz can be attributed to his ability to produce innovative compositions over several decades. As a pianist, Ellington frequently played a subtle role in the arrangements for this assignment, but as a composer, he excelled at crafting complex pieces that showcased the talents of individual band members. By creating a framework where soloists could freely improvise, Ellington combined tightly orchestrated pieces with phrases that highlighted each musician's unique style, ultimately shaping the tone of the orchestra as a whole. This approach enabled him to write some of the most groundbreaking and exceptional pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's use of voice as a jazz instrument, exemplified in \"Creole Love Call,\" an early piece from his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues showcases Ellington's ability to incorporate voice without the constraints of lyrics, adding texture and color to the music. The song's structure is evident in its six choruses, which demonstrate Ellington's skill in complementing his soloists' styles.\n\nIn \"Creole Love Call,\" each chorus presents a unique interpretation of the melody, from the initial call-and-response between voice and reeds to the muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody. The sweeping clarinet solo and full-band echo of the first chorus further showcase Ellington's ability to balance contrasting elements. The climactic fifth chorus features a call-and-response exchange between reeds and brass, backed by syncopated stop-time from the rhythm section. Finally, the sixth chorus returns to the first chorus's structure, with the voice adopting the \"growl\" technique and soloing as an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a tone color enhancer is a hallmark of his compositional style. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year after \"Creole Love Call,\" he combines his mastery of orchestration with a keen ear for tone color. The call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound. Similarly, in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to great effect, introducing the melody in a way that showcases his unique style.",
            "She couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness that had been plaguing her since she was 14. It was a void that she couldn't quite put her finger on, and it had been lingering for three years, despite her growing into her teenage years. As she entered her late teens, she found herself searching for something more substantial than material things. Yet, despite being in her early 17, she hadn't found anyone who piqued her interest. She often found herself wondering what could be causing this peculiar phenomenon in a teenage girl. Her theories and contemplations over the years had yielded nothing concrete, leaving her questioning her own desires.\n\nIn her daily life, she was fortunate to have a peaceful and loving family environment. Her parents were calm and level-headed, hardly ever disagreeing with each other, and rarely clashing with their daughter. The only time they would argue was when she tried to assert her independence and free-spirited nature, which often put her at odds with their more reserved personalities. Today, however, was not a typical day. As she wandered from room to room in search of inspiration, she was startled by a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen, followed by her mother's frantic voice. Panicked, she rushed into the room to find her mother lying on the ground, writhing in pain and repeating \"Ow\" in short, pained gasps. Her daughter rushed to her side and took her hand, trying to offer assistance. \"Mom, what's wrong?\" she asked, her voice laced with concern. \"I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother gasped, her words rushed and labored. Her daughter quickly sprang into action, helping her mother to the car and driving her to the hospital.\n\nUpon arrival, the hospital's familiar scents of disinfectant and antiseptic hit her, but her focus remained on helping her mother. She quickly called for medical attention and sat anxiously as the doctors and nurses rushed to attend to her mother's injuries. It turned out that her mother had fallen off a stepping stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to investigate the relationship between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality. The study focused on a modified version of the Med diet, known as the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet\", which features higher consumption of plant foods, monounsaturated fats, and fish, as well as lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake was also allowed.\n\nPrevious research has demonstrated an inverse association between Med diet adherence and total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, with one study showing the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, prior studies did not specifically examine the relationship between Med diet adherence and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nA prospective cohort study involving 74,886 women aged 38-63, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states, was conducted. The study spanned 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, during which time the authors calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) six times. Over 95% of the nurses remained in the study throughout this period. The FFQs were validated, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical records, hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo minimize individual variability and capture long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated, averaging scores from two prior years. The authors controlled for potential confounders, including age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe results showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe economic downturn, marked by high unemployment, a crumbling housing market, and the downfall of several major corporations. This prolonged recession has raised crucial questions: how did this crisis unfold, and what steps can we take to prevent it from happening again? In a nutshell, the financial crisis was sparked by reckless and uninformed decision-making by politicians that led banks and companies to issue sub-prime loans into a fragile financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were coerced into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into complex securities, which ultimately led to a chain reaction of financial chaos. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left scrambling, transferring the fallout onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold and on to the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis date back to the late 1990s, when President Clinton was seeking re-election. To boost his popularity, his administration relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the impending sub-prime crisis seven years later. New York Times journalist Steven Holmes reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the country's largest mortgage underwriter, was under intense pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand lending to low- and moderate-income borrowers, while also meeting shareholder expectations for high profits.\" Holmes astutely predicted the consequences of these actions: \"However, the government-subsidized corporation might encounter trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to the savings and loan industry crisis of the 1980s.\" As outlined earlier, these ill-conceived lending practices would ultimately lead to a catastrophic economic collapse.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the increasingly complex mortgage system. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were overused in the years leading up to the crisis, entangling various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets becoming severely over-indebted and vulnerable to even minor changes in housing prices. The housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities reeling. By 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, representing around 30% of the country's GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at rock-bottom prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transform into commercial banks subject to strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie were saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "You know that part in your story where you let your writer's imagination run wild and take flight, only to risk losing your readers to a sea of unnecessary details? That's what I'm talking about - the dreaded exposition. It's the section where your readers' eyes glaze over, and they're secretly hitting the \"Back\" button on their browser. Dr. Merlin, for one, has been known to mutter to herself at the screen when she finds herself bogged down in too much information - and not in the fun way.\n\nExposition can be a major pitfall for writers. Even those who know the mantra \"Show, don't tell\" can still fall into the trap of lengthy passages that don't advance the plot. It's like having two devils on your shoulder: one telling you to get the backstory out of the way so you can get to the good stuff, and the other urging you to share every last detail about your characters' childhoods.\n\nSo, what exactly is exposition? It's the process of telling your audience what happened, often in straightforward language. Think of it like a film's info dump, where one character lays out a whole chunk of backstory to another. In fiction, it's when the author does the telling rather than showing.\n\nLet's take an example. Imagine you're reading a story, and the heroine is telling you that she met her beloved at such-and-such a place and time, got married in a fancy ceremony, and then her husband was tragically murdered in front of her. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, would you? You'd expect the author to flesh out the husband's character, showing how much he loved his wife through his words and actions. Similarly, you'd expect the heroine to reveal her feelings about him through her thoughts, words, and actions. This would help you connect with her on a deeper level and mourn her loss when her husband dies.\n\nIn short, you want to add meat to the bare bones of the storyline. Instead of just telling your readers \"They met, they married, he died,\" you want to give them a richer understanding of the characters and their relationship. As a writer, it's your job to provide that depth. So, the next time you're tempted to rush through a scene, remember: a little exposition can go a long way, but too much can leave your readers yawning.",
            "I recently watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio, and my observations have left me with some thoughts. The first one was NBC 4's live broadcast on August 13, 2011. The lead story was about a disturbing incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife. The news team showed his mug shot, and his expression seemed sinister. Although the story was still developing, I think they allocated the right amount of time to it, around two minutes. The details provided were limited to his arrest and the fact that he stabbed his wife multiple times.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting that left Travis Buyers, 18, critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. Despite the severity of the incident, no arrests had been made at the time, and no suspects were identified. I couldn't help but notice that the story seemed rushed, and I believe it might be a result of the fact that the victim was a young black man from a predominantly black neighborhood. I've observed a pattern over the years where crimes committed by minority victims are often glossed over or receive less attention than those committed against white victims. If a white person were in a similar situation, the media would likely devote more time and attention to the story. The stark contrast is striking.\n\nThe next story covered the discovery of a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. The news team provided some details about the location of the incident and the type of bullet used. A .22 caliber bullet from a rifle was identified as the cause of the damage, and Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe forecast for the weekend was also covered, with temperatures predicted to remain in the mid to low eighties. The segment was relatively short, but it seemed like a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nAnother story reported on a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie and a sweatshirt. I found it interesting that the news team devoted an unusual amount of time to emphasizing his racial characteristics. \n\nLastly, a story highlighted the case of Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas-based drug kingpin who had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana in Ohio. I couldn't help but wonder why the news team chose to mention his ethnicity, as it seemed irrelevant to the story. The use of the term \"300 months\" instead of \"25 years\" also caught my attention, and I'm not sure what the reasoning behind it was.",
            "There's a bond between brothers – an unbreakable, unshakeable connection that transcends even the deepest of emotions. Within that bond, a complex web of feelings unfolds: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, to name a few. Brothers have a unique understanding of one another, a connection that can only be truly grasped by those who've experienced it firsthand. When things take a turn for the worse, the true nature of this bond shines through, whether it's love, loyalty, or malevolence. These emotions come with a hefty price tag, but they also offer a glimpse into one's true character. When you look into your brother's eyes, you see a reflection of yourself, not as others see you, but as you truly are. Your actions and their consequences are where your true character lies.\n\nThis theme is beautifully explored in James Hurst's short story, \"The Scarlet Ibis.\" Two brothers navigate the ups and downs of this bond, with all the associated emotions that come with it. Against the backdrop of a lush, vivid landscape, their journey is a poignant exploration of the human experience. Bitter disappointment clashes with overwhelming pride in a heart-wrenching climax, and only one brother escapes unscathed. Through the protagonist's direct characterization and interactions with his brother, Doodle, as well as the narrator's insightful perspective, the complex emotions that shape their world are expertly conveyed.\n\nAt the heart of the story is the protagonist's complicated relationship with his brother. He had envisioned a partner to share in his adventures, someone to join him in exploring the world. Instead, he's faced with a brother who's fragile and vulnerable. His resentment and frustration are palpable, especially when he recalls his initial disappointment and frustration with Doodle's condition. He had expected a brother who could keep up with him, but Doodle's limitations were a harsh reality check. Even so, the protagonist's anger and frustration are tempered by moments of tenderness, like when Doodle smiles at him. This shows that, deep down, he genuinely cares for his brother.\n\nThe story raises important questions about the nature of brotherhood and the complex emotions that come with it. Through the protagonist's experiences, we see that the bond between brothers is multifaceted and far-reaching, capable of inspiring both love and cruelty. It's a powerful reminder that our actions have consequences, and it's through these consequences that we come to understand our true character.",
            "The human brain is a complex and dynamic information-processing system.  As technology has advanced from ancient to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also undergone significant changes. People have initially compared the brain to a simple wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently to a computer. However, it's essential to keep in mind that these metaphors have their limitations and can lead to incorrect conclusions. \n\nWhen sensory organs process external stimuli, they convert them into electrical signals. This information is then processed and transformed repeatedly through the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing methods. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing gathers fundamental information such as color, orientation, and where the object's borders are, ultimately deciding that it's a box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, uses previously made decisions to accelerate box recognition. It might, for instance, help identify the object as a black box rather than a hole in the white background.\n\nOnce processed to some extent, a selective filter determines the signal's importance and which cognitive processes should be made available to it. It's the same as how you can focus on your name being spoken in a noisy room, while ignoring individual blades of grass when you look down. There are many stages of processing, and the results are constantly modulated by attention.\n\nFor the brain to process and store information, it must first be stored. There are several types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with different encoding methods applicable to various sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded based on its structural appearance, sound, or meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Research suggests that working memory, which stores information for around 20 seconds, is maintained through an electrical signal circulating through a series of neurons for a short time. On the other hand, long-term memory is believed to be maintained through the structure of specific proteins.\n\nThere are various models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human subjects' memory retrieval patterns, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts, with connections between them based on their relatedness. For instance, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In his novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley paints a dire picture of a future society where technology and capitalism have merged to create a dystopia. In this world, people are conditioned to prioritize community over individuality and instant gratification above all else. The citizens are essentially pawns in a game controlled by the World Controller, with their every move dictated by a strict ideology. Through the lens of Marxist ideas, it's clear that Huxley was warning us about the dangers of emerging systems in his time. He uses terms like homogeny and reification, characteristic of Marxist thought, to show how people are essentially trapped in a system that suppresses their true potential.\n\nHuxley critiques capitalism by using the concept of false consciousness, where the common person is kept from understanding the true nature of their relationships with other classes in economic terms. They're focused on their own self-interest, oblivious to the manipulation by the World Controller. The lower classes, represented by Delta and Gamma, are conditioned to be driven by their desires for consumption and indulgence, making them unaware of the manipulation. This is a perfect example of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over others. The upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, are aware of the manipulation but don't do much to challenge it, further solidifying the oppressive nature of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are superficial and lacking in depth. This could be a commentary on how the rise of technology and capitalism erodes our free will and emotions. Love and extreme emotions are non-existent, replaced by shallow interactions and objectification of others. The fact that characters like Bernard, who are aware of the system, don't challenge it further highlights the complacency of the society. This is a clear indication of the Marxist idea that the proletariat are conditioned to believe they're superior as long as they conform and continue to consume.\n\nBy examining Brave New World through a Marxist lens, it's clear that Huxley was warning us about the dangers of a society where people are controlled by a dominant ideology. His use of Marxist terminology and concepts shows that he saw the emerging systems of his time as a threat to individual freedom and autonomy.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for almost three years now, having completed close to five semesters. For many of us, getting around campus can be a challenge. My freshman year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, which is about as far east as you can get on campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The commute from my Stuart Hall home to classes in buildings like the Willard building, located near the heart of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather's bad – and bad weather is common in State College. Speaking with an alum who's not much older than me, I learned that the East Halls dorms used to be isolated from the rest of the campus by large areas of unused land. Today, those empty spaces have been filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments, including the Creamery and a new health services building. As our campus continues to grow, navigating the campus becomes increasingly difficult. So, what's the solution to this mobility issue? On a college campus, the answer is clear: the bicycle. However, having a bike alone won't solve the problem. We need to ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nRecently, I had a conversation with a friend who recently started riding a bike again after a few-year hiatus. He told me that he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Besides being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. With a bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical exertion, you can cover 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was buying a bike. Every day, I have classes in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, but it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or not. Walking has its benefits, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That's over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on. That's more time than I can spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "My career ambition is to pursue an occupation in social work, specifically with the Division of Family and Children Services, to make a positive difference in the lives of children who have been abused or neglected and to offer support to struggling families. The core values that will guide my professional development in this field include a commitment to service, respect, an unwavering commitment to ethics, a dedication to enhancing relationships between individuals, and a continuous striving for professional growth and competence.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been a driving force in my life, and I was initially uncertain about the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my high school and college years, I witnessed many individuals struggling with their problems, some using coping mechanisms that weren't ideal, and others turning a blind eye to their issues. These experiences led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Although I still hadn't determined my ideal career path, I took a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. A pivotal encounter with a friend's 16-year-old friend, who was escaping an abusive home life, prompted me to consider a career in social work. I realized that my degree in Psychology could be used to make a tangible difference in the lives of those who needed it most. I soon found myself visiting the teenager's parents' house, where I expressed my concerns to the police and offered to speak with the parents. This experience crystallized my resolve to pursue a career in social work, where I can help children and families navigate complex family dynamics.\n\nSocial justice is another value that is deeply ingrained in me, and I believe it's essential for the social work profession. As a society, we often claim to value individuality, but our actions often contradict this sentiment. We mourn the loss of individuals, yet we strive to conform to societal norms and expectations. I, on the other hand, celebrate my uniqueness and refuse to be bound by arbitrary limitations. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively protested against social injustice whenever possible: expressing my individuality through bold fashion choices, speaking out against racism and discrimination, and participating in social justice movements like the GSBA. I will continue to champion social justice and stand up against injustice in all its forms.",
            "Insomnia, a sleep disorder that affects millions, has been a topic of interest in both the biological and sociocultural realms.  The biological model sheds light on the genetic and physiological factors that contribute to insomnia, while the sociocultural model explores the environmental influences that impact sleep patterns. This review will delve into the biological and sociocultural models of insomnia, examining the research that underlies each and critiquing their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders related to other mental health issues, or sleep disorders caused by medical conditions or substance intake. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias, such as Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and others, which affect an individual's ability to initiate and maintain sleep. On the other hand, Parasomnias, like Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder, are characterized by behavioral and physiological abnormalities during sleep.\n\nThe biological model focuses on the genetic and physiological aspects of insomnia, with research indicating that neurons in the hypothalamus play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for sleep-wake states, and activating the GABAA receptor promotes sleep. Conversely, inhibiting this receptor can lead to reduced anxiety and increased sleep time. These findings suggest that genetic and environmental factors contribute to the physical GABAB receptor in humans, and abnormalities in this receptor may affect an individual's ability to sleep without medication.\n\nThe sociocultural implications of this study are significant, as inherited genetic traits can regulate sleep patterns, and alterations to the receptor can disturb sleep, impacting daily life activities. This highlights the importance of understanding the biological underpinnings of insomnia and how they intersect with environmental factors, such as demographics, socioeconomic status, and cultural background.\n\nBy examining the biological and sociocultural models of insomnia, researchers and healthcare professionals can better understand the complexities of this sleep disorder and develop more effective treatments. A comprehensive approach that takes into account both biological and environmental factors is essential for addressing the multifaceted nature of insomnia.",
            "This paper delves into the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, a concise explanation of the disorder is provided. Following this, the diagnosis process is explored, highlighting common characteristics that serve as warning signs. Lastly, the paper concludes by discussing ways in which a teacher in a mainstream classroom setting can support a student with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's inefficiency in processing auditory information. In essence, the central nervous system (CNS) struggles to interpret and differentiate sounds, making it challenging for individuals with CAPD to distinguish words, conversations, and background noise. Unlike those with hearing impairments, people with CAPD can hear normally, but the area of the brain responsible for sound processing is not functioning as it should.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has its roots in the 1950s, when it was initially referred to as \"auditory imperception.\" Researchers, including the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began developing tests to identify children with communicative disorders in the mid-1950s. In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiological mechanisms underlying dichotic perception.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways, including difficulties with sound localization, distinguishing between multiple auditory events, recognizing sound patterns, and differentiating changes in speech. Additionally, individuals with CAPD may experience auditory masking, where one sound is blocked by a subsequent sound, or struggle to synthesize sound clues to interpret them meaningfully. They may also have trouble determining the sequence of auditory information presented to them.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a thorough evaluation is required, involving systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals use various measures to assess auditory-related skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors. There is no single, consistently effective tool or test for diagnosing CAPD, and its causes remain unknown. Advanced tests may involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "It seems that the play Twelfth Night suggests that while a disguise can be a useful tool for deception, it can ultimately lead to a loss of identity if it is not shed. However, abandoning a deception can also result in alienation. This creates a difficult decision for the individual, who must weigh the importance of self-preservation against the preservation of relationships with others. Some people may not take kindly to being deceived, and may feel offended by the charade. \n\nThe theme of deception in the context of gender role reversal is particularly problematic, as it raises questions about the motivations behind such behavior. In the case of Viola, her decision to disguise herself as a man is a form of self-protection in a foreign land. However, this approach also isolates her from the support system of women around her. Her convincing portrayal of a man even leads Olivia to confuse her with her twin brother Sebastian, causing her to fall in love with Viola. This adds to the complexity of Viola's situation, as she also struggles with suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino. \n\nWhile Twelfth Night may seem progressive in its portrayal of unexpressed emotions, it can also be seen as highlighting the ways in which deception can lead to the revelation of hidden desires, as seen in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may have subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario based on his masculine appearance, or does she genuinely harbor feelings for women? It is likely that Olivia is satirizing the people of her time who judge others based on appearance alone, as evidenced by her swift shift in romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian.",
            "I've always thought that the German colonial empire was a complex beast, with policies and ruling styles as varied as its geography. While it's often noted for its brutal aspects, such as the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa, it's clear that the empire's educational provisions were just as diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a population of educated and literate Africans, which was a stark contrast to what they would find in other colonies. For instance, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were praised by contemporary authors, but the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) was a far cry from these successes. Unlike in East Africa, where the government took a leading role in education, in South West Africa the task of educating the natives was left largely to missionary societies, which received limited government support. This had significant and lasting effects on the colony.\n\nOne of the key factors that contributed to these divergent experiences was the presence of a large settler population in South West Africa. This is a point that Cohen's study highlights, comparing the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa. According to Cohen, the relatively temperate climate and large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of its educational system. With nearly 15,000 whites living in South West Africa by 1913, compared to just 5,336 in East Africa, it's clear that the colonial authorities in South West Africa had a different set of priorities. While they invested in state schools and supported missionary schools for European settlers, the native population was largely left to fend for themselves. The result was that \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.\" This legacy of neglect continues to shape the region to this day, and it's a fascinating topic of study.\n\nIn terms of existing literature, there's a wealth of research on education in the German colonial empire, most of which is in German and from the early twentieth century. While these early sources provide valuable insights into the features of educational systems in different colonies, later studies in English have expanded the discourse, offering comparative analyses of education in the various German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific aspects of education. Cohen's study is a standout in this regard, providing a nuanced understanding of the factors that contributed to the divergent experiences of South West Africa and East Africa.",
            "The world of popular music has undergone a significant transformation over the past hundred years, evolving into a vast array of genres that seem to have no end. To make matters more complex, many of these genres have spawned their own sub and sub-sub genres, leaving it challenging to provide an exhaustive list. However, one genre that has managed to stand out in the past four decades is Heavy Metal rock, which has become a melting pot of diverse and expressive styles.\n\nHeavy Metal's expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, predominantly the darker aspects of human experience. The genre's diversity, on the other hand, is a result of its flexibility, which allowed musicians to experiment and create their own unique sub-genres. Over time, this process has continued, resulting in a multitude of niches that make it difficult to define what Heavy Metal truly is.\n\nToday, Heavy Metal has evolved to incorporate elements from other genres, yet its roots remain a mystery. To truly comprehend the vast array of Metal music that surrounds us, one must first grasp the essence of the Metal movement and why it's more than just a genre.\n\nAt its core, Metal is a movement defined by darkness – a \"music of more\" that features louder volumes, more intensity, and a greater emphasis on theatricality. Metal musicians are known for their exceptional skill and technical prowess, which is evident in their music. Moreover, Metal's history is deeply intertwined with the world of psychedelia, with the mid-70s drug boom playing a significant role in shaping the genre. Many iconic Metal bands drew inspiration from the darker, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era, resulting in lyrics that reflect the genre's affinity for the darker aspects of human emotion.\n\nTake, for instance, the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter,\" a song that has been cited as one of the first Heavy Metal tracks. Its lyrics, which explore the ups and downs of a supposed psychedelic experience, demonstrate the genre's affinity for the darker side of human experience. This song was, in part, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker sound, with the Beatles seeking to prove that they could rival their peers in terms of intensity.",
            "A few decades before Surrealist artists started bringing their dreamlike works to life, Henri Rousseau was quietly crafting his own dreams – both in his paintings and in his imagination. His 1910 painting, The Dream, not only captures a woman's awe at the wonders of the fantastical land she visits in her dreams, but also reflects Rousseau's own dreams and aspirations as a painter. For years, he longed to be recognized, accepted, and praised by his fellow artists and art enthusiasts. However, he faced a tough inner struggle: should he conform to established styles to gain acceptance or stay true to his unique vision and forge his own path?\n\nTo understand The Dream, it's essential to know a bit about Rousseau's life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, Henri grew up in a relatively comfortable household with a father who was a successful tinsmith and hardware dealer. Despite his comfortable upbringing, Rousseau received no formal art training and instead worked for the French government as a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, until he was 40. The nickname that stuck, douanier (customs inspector), was a far cry from his true passion – painting. After the loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children, Rousseau found solace in art, hoping it would bring him comfort and a fresh start. Unlike his contemporaries, who sentimentalized and romanticized the peasant in their paintings, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of the average person.\n\nGiven his circumstances, it's no wonder Rousseau yearned for recognition from the art world. He was an older artist starting his career at a time when many talented and well-known modern artists were already established. It wasn't until around the same time that Matisse began gaining recognition that Rousseau started to receive the accolades he deserved. According to Jan Gordon in his book Modern French Painters, Rousseau and Matisse were distinct not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for creating art: while Matisse sought to avoid painting in a conventional manner, Rousseau aimed to create a picture so conventional that it would earn him acceptance into the Artiste Français.",
            "Many influential thinkers have long argued that there's a profound connection between ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. In my opinion, this connection stems from a fundamental aspect that ties them together. As John Keats so eloquently puts it in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" We often learn various aspects of life through education or personal experiences, but our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to be derived from a different source, as Keats suggests. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe, rather than dictate. Our studies of morality and beauty are primarily attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nIn essence, criticism of art or morals can never fully grasp the essence of what's good or beautiful. Discussing the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might center around concepts like foreground, background, or cultural context, but these aspects don't capture why it's considered good art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like \"There's just something about it\" before providing a more complex explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor so astutely observes, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we describe a work of literature, there's always something transcendent left untouched. Similarly, I propose that ethics has this same quality. As Wittgenstein aptly notes, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I suggest that this \"something\", this je ne sais quoi, is what makes art and morality so powerful, and this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\nIn my opinion, morality and art are closely related because we experience both at a deep, noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be felt, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to literature, an art form that stands out due to its unique moral quality, as McKean notes. He argues that, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a strong and unified country with a unique blend of culture that spans from the picturesque Alps in Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This rich culture is also evident in cities like Cologne on the Rhine River, the heart of Germany, and the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe River. It's no surprise that Germany's identity is shaped by its complex history and the diverse tribes that have influenced its development over time. \n\nThe origins of the name \"Germania\" are shrouded in mystery, with scholars and historians debating its true meaning. Some attribute it to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe mentioned by the Roman historian Tacitus. According to him, they were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine River and clashed with the Gaulish forces. Julius Caesar, who first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, believed it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In his writings, Caesar noted that the Germans lived beyond the Rhine River and were constantly at war with the Gauls. Others speculate that the name \"German\" comes from the spear used in warfare, known as a \"ger\" in Old English, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which might indicate the Germans were a loud and boisterous people.\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus wrote extensively about the origins of the Germans in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum.\" He described the Germans as an aboriginal people, untouched by other cultures through immigration or interaction. According to Tacitus, only those who were driven by desperation would leave their homes in Asia or Africa to venture into the harsh and unforgiving landscape of Germany. The Romans, for their part, were content to trade with the Germanic tribes and occasionally launch military campaigns into their territory, but they rarely settled there.\n\nAs the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the fringes of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and skills with the Romans in exchange for their military service. The Germans' reputation as fierce warriors and skilled traders was well-known throughout the ancient world, shaping the course of European history for centuries to come.",
            "As I stood there, my gaze drifted downwards, taking in the scene before me, but my mind remained blank, unwilling to grasp the significance of what I was seeing. It was as if I was observing it all from a detached perspective, without any emotional connection. My thoughts flitted in and out of my consciousness, fleeting and ephemeral, never really taking hold. My mental processes hummed along, efficient and smooth, creating a seamless experience, but devoid of any real introspection.\n\nI recalled a conversation with an artist I had worked with, who recommended an instructional book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. I had long been fascinated by drawing, ever since I was a child, and this book promised to teach me the fundamentals. One technique it highlighted was to frame a picture with a square, stripping away extraneous details and reducing it to its essence. I had always been overwhelmed by the complexity of the world around me, and I longed to capture its beauty.\n\nAt that moment, staring at the bowl of food in front of me, I couldn't even imagine applying that artist's perspective. I was too caught up in the sheer magnitude of what I was seeing. I felt like I was stumbling upon a masterpiece, the start of something magnificent. I had always admired the works of Picasso, Monet, and the Renaissance masters, each with their own unique style and vision. If I was to consider myself an artist, this could be the beginning of my own masterpiece, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand hovered over the pencil, and for a moment, I felt the urge to create. My muscles tensed, and my hand began to move, but instead of sketching, I was gripping the toilet handle. The water swirled, serene and smooth, but the brown package remained stuck. I stood there, frowning, my green tie constricting my neck, as I gazed at the mess someone had left behind. A few more flushes, a few more moments of introspection, and then I reached for the toilet paper, my hand instinctively wrapping itself like a mitten. I stood up straight, bent at the waist, and slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, as if I was approaching a sacred ritual, or perhaps a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "The alarming trend of teenage drivers behind the wheel is a grave concern in the United States.  Several factors contribute to this devastating statistic, and one key reason is the fact that the teen brain is not yet fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Inexperience is another crucial factor, which not only leads to fatal accidents but also increases the risk of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.  To make matters worse, teenagers are more likely to engage in reckless behavior when they're driving with their peers, a disturbing trend that is all too common.  According to the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, there's a clear correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents that occur.\n\nIn an effort to address this issue, many states have implemented provisional licenses that restrict the hours teens can drive and prohibit other minors from being passengers.  However, I believe these measures are merely a temporary fix.  The root problem lies in the fact that, as a group, the youngest drivers are not yet capable of handling the risks and responsibilities of driving.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that even at 18, many individuals are still prone to thrill-seeking behavior, making it essential to delay the granting of regular driver's licenses until this tendency has subsided.  If we continue to issue licenses to young teens, the number of fatal accidents will likely skyrocket, especially when the Baby Boomer babies reach driving age and millions of new teen drivers hit the road by 2010. \n\nA sensible solution to this issue would involve schools continuing to provide driver's education classes to prepare future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 would be allowed to operate a vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full driver's license, along with a set number of practical driver's training hours, such as the 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult currently required in California.  Uniform, national legislation addressing this issue would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the country.  This idea is not new, but it's a crucial step towards preventing the staggering number of teen driving fatalities that will surely occur if we fail to act.",
            "I spent some time browsing through the Library of Congress's early film collection and decided to watch all 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films rely heavily on creative editing to create illusions. My study of these films primarily focused on understanding the poetic techniques used in most of them and analyzing the unique characteristics of a few of the later films that broke free from traditional norms. It's worth noting that most trick films from this era are set-bound, shot from a frontal proscenium, feature no camera movement, and stick to the one shot = one film concept, but there were a few exceptions that dared to challenge these conventions.\n\nOne of the most notable similarities among the trick films is their use of interior sets within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary and does not move to follow characters or objects, a style that originated from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. This method has a limitation, however, as figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, never walking towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where the actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, never leaving the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also means that most shots are long shots, with medium shots appearing less frequently. Close-up shots are completely absent in these early Edison films, drawing from the theatre and vaudeville tradition where the audience sees the entire performance at a time, framed by the stage borders. As with most early films, the actors do not approach the camera, so close-ups are nonexistent.\n\nIn general, most early trick films follow the pattern of one conceptual shot equalling a film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. This also restricts the use of tricks in storytelling, with most films focusing on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts. However, closer inspection reveals that a single \"shot\" can actually be composed of multiple joined shots to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), where a more detailed look reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a true champion of Republicanism, and his dedication to this cause was evident in both his agricultural pursuits and his brief foray into politics. As a result, he became known for his unwavering commitment to personal freedoms and government accountability. His views on governance were deeply rooted in his beliefs about the importance of an agrarian society, which he saw as the foundation for his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to create a perfect system of government, unencumbered by the traditional norms of previous societies. This allowed for the establishment of a system of self-governance that respected the natural rights of individuals, which he believed were interconnected and interdependent. He argued that if one of these rights was denied, the value of the others would be diminished, and that they should therefore be safeguarded from government interference.\n\nAccording to Taylor, the concept of the \"state of nature\" meant that those with physical strength and cunning often held power, but he believed that in a civilized society, this shouldn't be the case. To create an ideal society, he advocated for a government that acknowledged the duality of human nature, encompassing both good and evil. He was adamant that, as government is wielded by humans, all its virtues and vices must be human as well.\n\nTaylor defined good principles as those that protect private property, promote agriculture, and discourage capitalism. He believed that a government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest and avarice. However, he also recognized that self-interest was a natural human trait, but it became problematic when it led to the creation of sub-societies that exploited others.\n\nTo prevent the excesses of self-interest, Taylor believed that a good government was essential, and that it must be carefully monitored to avoid the introduction of bad principles. Like many other stalwart Republicans of his time, he advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, which granted the Federal government only the powers explicitly outlined in the document. He feared that an expansive Federal government would be expensive and tyrannical, but he also believed that a literal interpretation of the Constitution could be problematic without considering the intentions of its authors.\n\nIn fact, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence to be the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation. This perspective informed his views on governance and shaped his advocacy for a limited and accountable government.",
            "In reviewing Figure 17, it's clear that there was a significant drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project, which was a bit disheartening. It's hard to pinpoint the exact reason for this decline, but some contributing factors could be the onset of winter at our New England campus, which likely reduced the number of people commuting by bicycle or on foot. Additionally, the end of the fall semester and the subsequent holiday season may have caused many students and faculty to lose sight of the commuter log submissions in the midst of their busy schedules. Furthermore, the month-long break at the end of the semester and the start of the spring semester in late January might have also contributed to the low number of submissions in those months.\n\nAs projects like ours often experience a natural ebb and flow of energy and enthusiasm, it's not entirely surprising that participation declined after the initial excitement. In response, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign aimed at revitalizing the initiative and boosting log submissions. This effort did lead to an increase in submissions for that month. Nonetheless, we still faced the challenge of maintaining momentum despite the natural decrease in engagement and the unique challenges posed by holiday and semester breaks in higher education.\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles for our project – and, arguably, any alternative commuting initiative – is the deep-seated cultural preference for driving a car and the freedom it offers. To combat this, we provided incentives in the form of gift certificates to local businesses. While these prizes seemed sufficient at first, it would be interesting to see how larger, more substantial prizes might have affected participation. For instance, offering a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car as a prize might have been a game-changer. However, we stuck to the same prize format throughout the project, and it's possible that increasing the value of the prizes over time could have helped maintain engagement and prevent the decline we saw.",
            "An ETF, or exchange traded fund, offers an incredible combination of flexibility and diversification, making it a compelling choice for savvy investors.  By tracking an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets, ETFs provide the same benefits as index funds, but also offer the freedom to trade like a stock on an exchange.  This means you can enjoy the benefits of single stock ownership, such as selling short, buying on margin, and purchasing as few as a single share in any transaction, all while still having the diversification of an index fund.  One of the biggest advantages of ETFs is their low expense ratios, which are significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund.  However, there are some downsides to consider, such as the commission you pay on each trade, just as you would with a stock. \n\nThe other benefit of ETFs is the vast array of funds available, giving you a wide range of options to choose from.  But, it's essential for any shrewd investor to carefully evaluate the benefits of an ETF, including diversification, to make sure they actually exist and to what extent.  For this exercise, we'll be focusing on the ETF IHF and examining its top 10 holdings to see if owning a single ETF provides benefits similar to those of a diversified portfolio of the individual stocks.  We'll also investigate whether there are better configurations of the same stocks that would offer a more optimal risk-adjusted return.\n\nTo make the analysis manageable, we've narrowed our focus to the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets.  Here are the top 10 holdings and their corresponding percentages:\n\nTo get a sense of how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF as a whole, we can calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio consisted entirely of these stocks in the same proportions as the ETF.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the chart below.\n\nLooking at the chart, it's clear that a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings would have a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns.  Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's overall Beta.  These results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could potentially provide higher returns with lower risk.  However, it's also possible that the differences between the two portfolios are not statistically significant.\n\nTo further evaluate this, we've calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% for comparison with the ETF's accumulated standard deviation.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's self-proclaimed standout poems is \"Dream-Land.\" Poe's poem is notable for its incorporation of the word \"Thulé,\" which he uses twice as a bookend in the poem. The term \"Thulé\" is derived from Virgil, who used it to describe an island north of Britain that the ancient Greeks considered the edge of the known world. However, there's more to Poe's use of this term than meets the eye. Poe was a fan of German literature, and it's worth noting that his familiarity with Goethe's work may have played a role in his choice of this word. \n\nThis aspect of \"Dream-Land\" is significant because it highlights Poe's connection to Goethe's writing. In a book titled \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" Karl J. Arndt explores the similarities between the two authors' works, suggesting that Poe was, in fact, drawing inspiration from Goethe. \n\nGoethe is also notable for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem called \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king who becomes consumed by grief after his wife's death and eventually decides to end his life by throwing a goblet into the ocean. The description of the King of Thule bears a striking resemblance to the speaker in \"Dream-Land,\" who is haunted by death and loss. The parallel between these two characters can be seen as a dark echo of Poe's own experiences and struggles. \n\nInterestingly, Goethe's work was not only influential in the literary world but also in the realm of performance. In 1842, H.P. Grattan adapted \"Faust\" into a romantic drama, which was published just a year before Poe referenced Thule in his poem \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe references Thule twice in his collected writings, once in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and again in \"Dream-Land.\" Considering the similarities between \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land,\" it's possible to read these two poems as companion pieces. \n\nGoethe was a prominent author who, through his influence on Tennyson, would have been familiar to Poe. As a result, it's not surprising that Poe would have been exposed to Goethe's work, particularly in the numerous reproductions of his work that were being published at the time.",
            "Imagine a customer at a grocery store in California slipping and falling on an applesauce spill and being awarded punitive damages for the store manager's reckless behavior. The store manager was informed twice about the spill but took no action to clean it up because he was eating dinner, ignoring the risks of leaving the spill unattended. Could this be considered a serious enough offense to justify punitive damages?\n\nIn this case, a judge is unlikely to dismiss the customer's claim for punitive damages out of hand. To receive punitive damages, the customer must prove that the store manager's actions demonstrated a willful disregard for the harm that could occur from the spill, as well as despicable behavior. The customer can argue that the manager should have known about the potential harm of the spill, given that multiple customers had been injured in similar incidents at the store in the past. Furthermore, the manager failed to take steps to maintain a safe environment despite the risk, as six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in the store in 2009.\n\nThe customer's argument that the manager's actions were despicable is somewhat weaker, but still reasonable considering the facts. The manager was informed of the spill not once, but twice, and still chose to ignore it because he was on dinner break. This lack of regard for customer safety is disturbing, especially given the history of accidents at the store. It is clear that the manager's actions were not just a minor oversight, but a willful disregard for the well-being of his customers.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, the store employee Rich Wayne informed the manager, Paul Martin, about the applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin dismissed the issue, saying he was on dinner break. Half an hour later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill, but he responded in the same way. By 5:30 pm, the customer, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, suffering a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, there had been five reported slip-and-fall incidents at the store in 2009.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation that is not related to a contract if the defendant acted with malice, oppression, or fraud. The law defines malice as conduct that was intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, was despicable and showed a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others. In this case, the manager's actions demonstrate a clear disregard for the safety of his customers, and it is likely that the court will allow the customer's claim for punitive damages to proceed.",
            "It's been almost four years since I took a course in Islam at CBC, and a topic that sparked heated discussions back then remains relevant today: the perception of Islam as a hostile religion.  Looking back on the past decade, I've noticed a striking shift in media portrayals of Islam and extremists, from a predominantly negative view to an extreme level of tolerance in America.  The election of President Barack Obama, who has an evident Muslim heritage, is a testament to this shift.\n\nThe Life of the Prophet Muhammad has always fascinated me, but my understanding of his biography contradicts the image I had of him.  From my prior knowledge, I thought that Muhammad compelled people to convert to Islam through conquest and force.  However, the biography presents a different picture: that of a humble and misunderstood figure who was often submissive to others.  People gradually came to see the truth in his teachings and sought him out voluntarily.\n\nThe similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the purported miracles of Muhammad are also striking.  One example is when Muhammad multiplied food and drink for a group of forty men, much like the feeding of the five thousand by Jesus.  This style of writing creates a narrative that portrays Muhammad as a humble prophet who doesn't need to prove anything, but simply lives a life of truth and performs miracles.  This approach downplays the significance of Jesus' life and miracles, making it seem like they're trying to borrow from and attribute Jesus' character to Muhammad.\n\nI was also troubled by the way the biography presents stories of people's conversions to Islam as a form of proof or witness.  However, these stories often rely on secondhand or thirdhand accounts, which diminish their credibility.  This approach makes the stories seem suspicious and raises questions about the reliability of the narrative.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this biography is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure who is humble, wise, and gentle.  However, historical records contradict this image, and I wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "As we look back at the history of Christianity, it's clear that the teachings of Jesus and the core principles he stood for were largely forgotten as the faith evolved after his lifetime.  In broader strokes, it appears that Christianity has been moving increasingly further away from its roots.  However, the world is now witnessing a growing awareness and a progressive shift in the way people think.  While traditionalists will undoubtedly resist any attempts to stray from established doctrine, their influence may not be strong enough to hinder the inevitable change.  It's likely that Christians will increasingly seek to understand the true intent of their faith, separating the original teachings of Jesus from the additional dogma that's been added over time.  It may take decades or even centuries, but history has shown that a reversal of this trend is not only possible, but inevitable.  As the clock ticks backward, layers of doctrine will be stripped away, leaving only the core principles that Jesus introduced to humanity, untainted by the influence of other thinkers.  When this trend gains momentum in the United States and Europe, it will likely be accompanied by a unifying force, with people coming together to worship in a more authentic way, guided by Jesus' original ideas.  The church will remain a guiding institution, but its influence will be tempered by a return to the simplicity and unity of Jesus' message.  We'll see a shift from diversity to uniformity, as differences between regions, denominations, and divisions are bridged by a shared understanding of the faith.  History is replete with examples of such reversals, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from a persecutor to a Christian institution, and the shift from African-American slavery to leadership.  The great reversal that's on the horizon will be a return to the source, undoing the complexities of history in the process.  A key factor in this process will be the ability to interpret Jesus' words as metaphors, rather than literal statements.  Looking back, we find that the foundation of Christianity lies in Judaism, with its core principles of monotheism, divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures firmly in place by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population was not unified, with various factions like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people each holding different views.",
            "In my opinion, The Jungle is a powerful reflection of humanity's inherent selfishness and lack of empathy. Deep down, many people prioritize their own well-being and success above all else, disregarding those around them. This is evident throughout the novel, particularly in the actions and attitudes of the factory owners and managers. They are solely focused on expanding and profiting from their companies, regardless of the consequences to others or the environment. Upton Sinclair vividly describes the devastating impact of their actions, such as the pollution created by the factories, which is graphically portrayed in his writing, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". This powerful imagery highlights the callous disregard for the well-being of both humans and animals affected by the factories' operations.\n\nThe owners and managers also demonstrate a blatant disregard for the welfare of their employees, viewing them as mere commodities to be exploited for profit. They prioritize their financial gains over the lives and livelihoods of their workers, often subjecting them to long hours and hazardous working conditions. The novel suggests that, in the era in which it was set, there were few regulations protecting workers' rights, allowing the factory owners to operate with impunity. This led to a system in which workers were essentially treated as slaves, with no assistance or support available to them. The union movement, which was supposed to help workers, ultimately became a source of further exploitation, preying on the desperation of those it was meant to protect. Sinclair's portrayal of this system is a scathing critique of a society that values profit over people, leading to a culture of immorality and exploitation.",
            "Many authors have mastered the art of influencing their readers' perceptions through various literary techniques. F. Scott Fitzgerald is a prime example of this, skillfully employing several methods in his novel The Great Gatsby to evoke a particular feeling or attitude towards pivotal subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others, and Fitzgerald's use of unconventional pairings of adjectives and nouns is particularly noteworthy. He often pairs words that don't typically go together, imbuing them with a distinct aura. Furthermore, Fitzgerald leverages the symbolism of colors to create a lasting impression on readers. He builds up meaning around specific colors like white, gray, and red/pink, then cleverly employs them to convey a particular sentiment about an object or character. \n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald masterfully constructs the meaning of white and gray, with white signifying a sense of refinement and higher class, while gray represents age and a faded quality. This underlying meaning is skillfully established at the beginning of the novel through repeated usage. For instance, characters like Daisy and Jordan are frequently described as wearing white, and other characters such as Nick, Tom, and Catherine also sport white attire. In fact, the only time these characters don't wear white is when Nick is observing Gatsby's party, where the atmosphere is dominated by primary colors. Fitzgerald reinforces the distinction between white and gray by applying them to everyday objects and people, like the \"white chasms of lower New York\" and the \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable. He even uses these colors to describe plain or mundane people or places, such as the \"white girlhood\" Jordan and Daisy shared, the \"gray cars\" in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray old man\" selling dogs. \n\nOnce the meaning of white and gray is solidified, Fitzgerald uses them to convey a sense of uniformity or unimportance. This technique is first evident in the way he portrays Daisy. After a period of relative absence of these colors, Fitzgerald reintroduces them in association with Daisy, describing her as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster.\" As a result, readers begin to perceive Daisy as a uniform, almost interchangeable element, something that Gatsby desires but lacks. Fitzgerald reinforces this impression by applying similar techniques to other aspects of Daisy, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her appearance in a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is renowned for its thriving agricultural scene, primarily due to its pleasant, sunny climate. A variety of crops are planted here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial in the San Diego area, with many local organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists for their products. Organic eggs and milk are also highly sought after. Several organic farms in the region offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This type of farm can benefit from government programs while also enhancing the habitat, allowing for recreational use and educational programs.\n\nIn addition to catering to a lucrative niche market, organic farming often brings numerous benefits, such as increased biodiversity in the area due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming can be more labor-intensive and costly in some aspects. It requires more hands-on labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses may be higher than with conventional methods. Small organic farms also lack the efficiency of large-scale operations. Furthermore, practices that benefit wildlife but are unrelated to organic farming can incur additional labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions like edge habitat or patches of open ground. Consequently, there are many reasons why a landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to maximize both profits and habitat quality.\n\nThe land chosen for this scenario is a 160-acre parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. This property is a mix of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher. Others are declining and may soon be listed, including burrowing owls.\n\nThis area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The land in question was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years.\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations. As a model of what someone farming this land might aim to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area.",
            "In any given negotiation, culture plays a significant role in shaping the dynamics at the table. However, understanding culture can be a complex task, as it is not a fixed or uniform entity. It's essential to recognize that culture is often defined by its nuances and variations, rather than by broad generalizations. For instance, statements like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify the rich tapestry of cultural differences. A more productive approach is to focus on the specific cultural context and how it influences the negotiation process.\n\nWhen interacting with a foreign culture, we often find ourselves drawing comparisons to our own cultural norms. To effectively navigate these differences, it's crucial to study and appreciate the history, values, and prejudices of the culture in question. Rather than trying to change or judge the culture, it's vital to respect its boundaries and traditions, especially when in a weaker bargaining position. This approach can help break down cultural barriers and facilitate a smoother negotiation.\n\nHowever, culture is not limited to national or international distinctions. Companies within a given nation often develop their own corporate culture, which can be just as distinct as national cultures. This corporate culture can be reflected in employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. The diversity of thought within a company can be striking, even from region to region or within different departments. For instance, certain companies may prioritize long working hours, while others foster a more relaxed work environment.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally essential in negotiation, as they provide the underlying motivations and drivers of a culture. If a culture values saving face or communal harmony, a negotiator will likely avoid public conflicts or concessions. Conversely, a culture that prioritizes a hard-driven bargain may not be willing to settle at the earliest opportunity. By considering these cultural nuances, negotiators can tailor their approach to effectively engage with their counterparts and achieve their goals. Ultimately, taking the time to learn about one's opponent on a personal level can significantly enhance the negotiation process.",
            "In the Bible's Psalm 14, we find a profound quote that sets the tone for our discussion: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This phrase is also the foundation of St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God, which we will explore alongside that of Thomas Aquinas. Given that both authors are defending the same concept, we'll assume they're both correct in their belief in the God of the Bible. This allows us to compare their arguments without considering alternative deities. \n\nAlthough each author presents valid points, neither provides a comprehensive basis for believing in God. To illustrate this, let's delve into St. Anselm's argument. Anselm's passage suggests that faith is the path to understanding, and that the truth about God can be found within one's own mind. He posits that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive of his nonexistence. In essence, Anselm proposes that we don't need external evidence to prove God's existence, but rather, it's inherent in our own knowledge. This idea of accepting truth without irrefutable evidence is often referred to as faith in Christian texts. \n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas argues that God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This approach would be beneficial in evangelism, as it would allow new converts to be persuaded by logic rather than faith. Aquinas presents five logical arguments for the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God, much like how a missing puzzle piece can be inferred from the assembled rest of the puzzle.",
            "Somewhere in the ancient world, around the 5th or 6th century BCE, a young prince would be born who would later be known as the Buddha. Over the course of his life, he would renounce the world and achieve enlightenment, leading to the formation of Buddhism, a path that has been followed by millions of people for over 2,500 years. However, this ancient path has undergone significant changes since its inception. A prime example of this is the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed with great fervor, a tradition that wasn't even taught by the Buddha himself. This transformation is not limited to superficial practices but extends to the very core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both within the monastic and lay circles, has had to adapt its teachings over time due to various internal and external forces, both benevolent and malevolent.\n\nTo better understand this evolution, it's essential to grasp the nuances of certain terms that will be repeatedly used throughout this discussion. The terms internal and external refer to forces originating from within or outside the Buddhist community, respectively. A hostile force is any entity that seeks to harm or damage the community, often driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. On the other hand, a benign force may not intend to harm or help the community but may inadvertently do so as a byproduct. These definitions will be crucial in understanding the complex dynamics at play in the development of Theravada Buddhism.\n\nAt its core, Theravada Buddhism is built around a set of fundamental doctrines that guide its followers. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma (or the teachings), and the Sangha (the community). The Dhamma is comprised of the Tripitaka, three baskets of sacred texts: the Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the rules and regulations, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, including concepts like Anatta (the absence of a permanent self), Dukkha (the inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of all things). By recognizing these concepts, one can break free from Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, and ultimately overcome lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), which are the root causes of suffering. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for laypeople and monks alike, including the five precepts for laymen (not to kill, lie, steal, misbehave sexually, or consume intoxicating substances) and a more extensive set of rules for monks. At the heart of Buddhism lies the Four Noble Truths: first, the truth of suffering (Dukkha); second, the truth that attachment causes suffering; and third, the truth that suffering can be overcome.",
            "There's a fascinating example of an enduring rivalry between the United States and Mexico, which lasted for a whopping 57 years from 1836 to 1893. This long-standing feud reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the US emerged victorious, claiming Texas and the American Southwest as its own territory. Although the rivalry ebbed and flowed over the years, it finally dissipated just before World War I. The roots of this rivalry can be attributed to disagreements over fundamental issues such as religion, culture, and tradition, coupled with significant clashes of material interests, as noted by Schmitt (1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis situation is not unique to the US-Mexico relationship. Many nations sharing a border have historically experienced similar conflicts of interest, leading to the formation of rival positions. The US and Mexico are a prime example of this phenomenon. As David M. Pletcher (1977) pointed out, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41). Both nations are geographically close to the US and have been longstanding rivals, while other Latin American countries have enjoyed good relations with the US.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in fueling this rivalry, a common theme throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) noted that in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy, much like the ideological struggles seen in the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union (p. 86). The historical distrust between the English and Spanish also contributed to the tensions between the two nations, creating an obstacle to establishing amicable foreign relations.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), there were 17 disputes between Mexico and the US during the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes centered around territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. Border outlaws and bandits from American border towns posed a significant problem, which only subsided when both countries took military action to secure their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nInterestingly, the rivalry between the US and Mexico began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US and American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in the late 19th century, as Schmitt (1974) observed (p. 109-110).",
            "It's been 15 years since a life-altering illness struck me out of the blue, leaving me unexpectedly disabled. I was 46 years old, single, and a nurse at the time, having chosen my profession as a safe haven from the uncertainty of my childhood. People had often reassured me that I would always be able to find work, as everyone gets sick, and that mantra echoed in my mind as I pursued a career in nursing, even though my true ambitions lay in becoming a scientist or a journalist.\n\nHowever, fate had other plans. After 15 years of living on Social Security Disability, I've lost everything that I once considered mine. Each day is a struggle, a constant assault on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. The one thing that I can be certain of is that I wouldn't have made it this far without the unwavering support of my family and a few close friends. They've been my lifeline, and I'm deeply grateful for their presence in my life.\n\nMy point is that life is unpredictable, and emergencies can strike at any moment, big or small. No matter how prepared we think we are, some challenges are too great to face alone. I strongly believe that instead of relying solely on big government, Americans should learn to trust and help one another, to ask for assistance when needed, rather than becoming isolated and fend-for-themselves.\n\nThe idea of rugged individualism, often touted by Conservatives, glosses over the fact that our forefathers' resilience in hard times was not solely due to their self-reliance, but rather their compassion, mutual respect, and willingness to share resources. The pioneers who braved the treacherous terrain in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast alone; they relied on each other for support.\n\nOf course, being prepared is essential, and I've taken steps to ensure my readiness. I have a disaster kit, first aid supplies, water purifying tablets, and more. But beyond that, I believe it's equally important to foster a sense of community. Get to know your neighbors, build relationships, and be willing to lend a helping hand. It's not about being self-sufficient at all costs; it's about being part of a network that supports and uplifts one another.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in the way they do has long been a subject of debate. Many experts believe that there are certain restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change. While scientists have made significant progress in understanding the mechanisms of evolution, there is still much to be discovered. In fact, as D'Arcy Thompson noted in 1917, \"the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms.\" Recent studies have applied mathematical modeling to various aspects of mollusk development, including ontogeny and phylogeny. Our research is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum, combined with experimental studies, can help us understand the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the software program CerioShell, which allowed us to create hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. Our results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a better understanding of macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a three-dimensional structure that spirals through 360 degrees of space over time. The individual turns or revolutions of a coiled shell are known as whorls, which are thought to spiral around an imaginary central axis. This axis, called the columella, runs through the central column of the shell. The rate at which the whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line separates each whorl, known as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the last whorl, or body whorl. The spire is composed of all the whorls except the last one. The tip of the spire is called the apex, while the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The most common orientation of a shell is an apertural view, where the aperture is facing the viewer and the apex is pointing upwards.\n\nWhen counting whorls, it's essential to view the shell from the apical view and identify the first suture. A line can be drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls can be counted from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be seen as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal grows and builds its shell. By tracing the path of the aperture, we can use coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture to graphically and mathematically represent the shell's trajectory. Once we have a mathematical formulation, we can modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis by varying parameters.",
            "Despite making progress in various areas, Indonesia's neonatal and infant mortality rates have stagnated over the past decade.  While the country is on track to meet some of the Millennium Development Goals, such as improving access to water and sanitation, its child and maternal health targets are still a long way off from being met by 2015.  Several factors are contributing to these shortcomings, which highlight the need to strengthen the overall healthcare system rather than solely focusing on individual programs.\n\nOne area where Indonesia has seen improvement is in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% of births now meeting this standard.  However, this category includes traditional workers such as midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complicated pregnancies and are therefore contributing to a high number of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage.  As a result, the progress made in this area may be misleading, and there is still much work to be done.  Furthermore, the percentage of children under five treated for diarrheal diseases by a healthcare professional has declined, and data on postnatal care is incomplete, indicating that this area also requires attention.\n\nThe rate of cesarean sections is still lower than expected, at around 4%.  This rate also highlights another concern - the disparity in access to healthcare services across the country.  While urban areas have a c-section rate of 7%, rural areas have a much lower rate of 2%.  This disparity points to a lack of equity in service coverage, with access to healthcare services concentrated in urban areas.  Another issue is vertical equity, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor face significant barriers to accessing healthcare services due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the question is whether Indonesia should focus on developing program-specific approaches or strengthening the overall health system without prioritizing pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children.  While programmatic approaches can be attractive due to their targeted objectives and potential for quick results, there are also some drawbacks to consider.  Investing heavily in one area of the health sector can divert resources from other areas, causing human resources to shift towards more resourced sectors, such as the HIV/AIDS sector, at the expense of other areas like family planning.  Additionally, running multiple parallel programs in one area can lead to duplication of services and uncoordinated efforts, resulting in increased paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "One of the most notable characteristics of Victorian literature is the meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, two novels that deviate from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. Both of these works incorporate elements of mystery and an unconventional flair, setting them apart from the typical Victorian novels. This unique approach serves to deepen the characters within each story, offering valuable insights into their motivations and emotions.\n\nIn the midst of turmoil, the protagonist's mind becomes overwhelmed with a cacophony of thoughts. He finds himself caught in a chaotic melee, reliving a heated argument between Sikes and Crackit, who were disputing fiercely. As he struggles to focus, the sounds of gunfire and the cries of others pierce the air, and he's suddenly whisked away by an unseen force. Throughout this chaotic sequence, a gnawing sense of pain persists, tormenting him relentlessly.\n\nBoth novels employ dream sequences and dreamlike states to convey this sense of mystery. In Oliver Twist, these eerie occurrences often shed light on Oliver's inner turmoil, revealing the depths of his emotional pain and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. When Oliver re-experiences the shooting in Chapter 28, he relives it vividly, as if in a dream, while desperately seeking help. The passage highlights the sense of helplessness that Oliver feels, as if he's lost control over the events unfolding around him. His hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit underscore the dire circumstances that have befallen him, leaving him numb and crippled by fear. This shooting serves to reinforce the notion that Oliver has little control over his life, as he's unable to take charge, even in the face of impending danger. This growing sense of defeat is also implied, as if Fagin's influence has begun to break him, forcing him to accept his despair and rendering him powerless to react.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, a similar atmosphere of foreboding pervades the narrative. As the day wears on, it seems to vanish as quickly as it arrives, replaced by an endless and oppressive night, filled with an eerie silence that's both haunting and fleeting.",
            "A few years ago, I had the opportunity to work in an after-school program, where I helped Elementary age students with their studies, focusing on English and reading. One student, a boy named Adrian, really stood out, as he was having trouble reading. I was brought in to help him, and I soon realized that something was off - he had a peculiar problem with reading certain letters. It turned out that he spoke perfect English, but he didn't know the English alphabet that well. This was a surprising discovery, and it dawned on me that the language barrier is a complex issue that's often not as obvious as we think.\n\nThis experience made me realize that even a child who speaks perfect English can struggle with reading. I want to use this story to highlight the problem of the language barrier in schools, particularly in California. I think we can all agree that this is a significant issue. So, what's the solution? In Adrian's case, the answer was simple: tutoring in English reading, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for children who barely speak English, the solution is much more complicated.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer. The dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes - none of these solutions on their own will fix the problem. The key lies in combining them. The dual language system, for instance, has been shown to be effective. Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically. Some people may be hesitant to implement this system, thinking it's a waste of resources or that only a minority of students will benefit. But that's not true. If we made bilingual education the norm, rather than the exception, all children would benefit from it.\n\nSo, how do we make this work? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic and unreasonable. However, I do think that we can have bilingual aids, tutors, or whatever you want to call them, to support our students. By combining these different approaches, we can create a more effective solution to the language barrier in our schools.",
            "As kids, many of us are taught that there's something greater than us out there, something we can't fully comprehend.  Some of us attend Sunday school, while others visit the Temple or delve into our own inner selves for answers.  A lot of us simply accept the faith our parents passed down to us, but others flat-out reject it, doubting that there's anything beyond our own personal bubble.  We may adopt one set of values, only to later swap them out for another.  No matter the path we choose, we strive to find our own unique perspective on spirituality, our own guiding light in the darkness.  We're searching for something to lead us out of the shadows and into the light.\n\nOne time, I asked my dad about his favorite bird, and he mentioned cardinals.  We were sitting on our porch, listening to the rain pound against the tin roof above us, the gutters bringing it down and drowning the plants along the edge.  He was staring off into the rain, a mix of searching and remembering in his gaze.  He'd lost weight over the past few months, and his clothes hung loosely on his frame.  His hair was thinner, sparser too.  I felt a sense of isolation, fear, and desperation – I couldn't bring myself to talk to him about how much I'd miss him, because that would've made it all too real.  I hugged him, sat back down, and joined him in gazing out into the rain, our June twilight fading away.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had prolonged his life a bit, but it was a pointless suffering – I couldn't figure out what the point was.  As I lay there, alone at night, I stopped praying.  If God existed, I thought, he'd stopped listening to me a long time ago. \n\nI didn't want to watch my dad slip away.  I didn't want to see the man who created me fade into nothingness.  I wanted to remember him by how he lived, not by how he died.  I knew my dad better than anyone else did – I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to be a spectator at his passing.  For three days, I curled up in a ball, waiting for the news.\n\nBut no one even called me.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is an intriguing oxymoron, as suggested by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. It represents a paradoxical blend of the old and the new. The Gothic mode has been subjected to varying degrees of praise and criticism, with some viewing it as lacking substance and others appreciating its ability to evoke a sense of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew inspiration from both ancient and modern romance, thus launching the proto-Gothic genre and introducing a novel style of literary expression. By merging 'old' theatrical elements and 'new' narrative techniques, Walpole created a unique literary experience he termed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). Gothic literature is characterized by its reliance on medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, which were already perceived as archaic and unsophisticated at the time of the novel's publication. However, the fusion of the theatrical and the novel's personal narrative allowed Gothic literature to endure and remain relevant despite its perceived obsolescence.\n\nOne of the key elements of the Gothic genre is the concept of chivalry, which was deeply rooted in medieval tradition. The original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, retains and reinterprets the idea of chivalry, highlighting the idealized characteristics of the classic knight – bravery, honor, and competence. Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, drew on this concept to criticize the perceived decline of these values in their own society. By romanticizing the 'gothic past,' they aimed to improve the present and hint at the future evolution of Gothic literature into Romanticism. This is evident in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, such as his status as a prince, his experience of suffering, and his supposed martyrdom at the hands of infidels. The description of Frederic is replete with traditionally chivalric imagery, including his gallantry and courtesy, which serves to exaggerate the soon-to-be Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "The supply chain management process is a complex series of steps that involves the movement of goods from the raw materials stage all the way to the final customer. The term supply chain management was coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a renowned consultant. According to Keith Oliver, the goal of supply chain management is to create an efficient and effective process that meets customers' needs quickly and effectively. There are six key components to a well-oiled supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. By mastering these six elements, business managers can deliver top-notch customer service.\n\nFirst and foremost, production is the foundation of the supply chain process. It's the starting point where everything begins, and it's crucial to get it right. Managers need to know what customers want, and to figure that out, they need to analyze the market and understand customer demand. From there, they can decide what products to produce, how many to make, and where to produce them, all while keeping customer satisfaction in mind. Effective production planning is essential, as every detail counts. I've seen firsthand how important it is to have a solid plan in place, having worked at retail giants like Wal-Mart and Target. Both companies have detailed blueprints for every aspect of the business, from employee uniform layout to receiving shipments from trucks. Having a clear plan helps prevent confusion and ensures that everything runs smoothly.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply. This refers to the strategic decisions made to determine a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Managers need to decide which divisions of production are best suited for each product and whether to outsource certain tasks to other companies. The goal is to achieve velocity – the ability to deliver quality, flexibility, and low costs. By streamlining processes and making smart outsourcing decisions, companies can stay ahead of the competition and meet customer demands.",
            "People passing by can't help but take a glance at the stark message scrawled on Ellen Page's makeshift sign. The actress, known for her role in Juno, stands alone on a street corner, a poignant reminder of the country of Burma, now known as Myanmar, where a ruthless military junta has ruled with an iron fist since 1962. The junta's brutal takeover was a mere coup d'état, yet it has had a profound impact on the country's history. Fast forward to 2007, when a wave of street protests swept the nation, marking the first public demonstrations in a decade. Led by a large contingent of Burmese monks, these protests were dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" due to the distinctive color of their robes. However, the peaceful gatherings soon turned violent, with the military junta clashing with the monks and foreign journalists getting caught in the crossfire. The death toll, officially reported to be 13, may be a gross understatement, with defected Colonel Hla Win estimating that the actual number of fatalities could be several thousand.\n\nThis is a tragic yet all-too-familiar tale of a government cracking down on dissent and silencing its citizens. It's a phenomenon that has been evident throughout history, with power-hungry leaders dating back to the early Roman emperors declaring themselves divine rulers. The Japanese emperors, supposedly gods sent to guide their people, are another example, as are more recent instances like the Tiananmen Square protests in China, where thousands lost their lives in a brutal crackdown. The Rwandan genocide and Hitler's 'Third Reich' are other chilling examples of governments showing no qualms about brutal suppression of their citizens.\n\nIt's a sobering reminder that the quest for power and control has been a perpetual thorn in humanity's side since the dawn of civilization. We would do well to remember these dark chapters in our history and strive for a world where freedom of speech and assembly are cherished, not crushed.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz can be attributed to his ability to produce innovative compositions over several decades. As a pianist, Ellington frequently played a subtle role in the arrangements for this assignment, but as a composer, he excelled at crafting complex pieces that showcased the talents of individual band members. By creating a framework where soloists could freely improvise, Ellington combined tightly orchestrated pieces with phrases that highlighted each musician's unique style, ultimately shaping the tone of the orchestra as a whole. This approach enabled him to write some of the most groundbreaking and exceptional pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's use of voice as a jazz instrument, exemplified in \"Creole Love Call,\" an early piece from his career. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues showcases Ellington's ability to incorporate voice without the constraints of lyrics, adding texture and color to the music. The song's structure is evident in its six choruses, which demonstrate Ellington's skill in complementing his soloists' styles.\n\nIn \"Creole Love Call,\" each chorus presents a unique interpretation of the melody, from the initial call-and-response between voice and reeds to the muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody. The sweeping clarinet solo and full-band echo of the first chorus further showcase Ellington's ability to balance contrasting elements. The climactic fifth chorus features a call-and-response exchange between reeds and brass, backed by syncopated stop-time from the rhythm section. Finally, the sixth chorus returns to the first chorus's structure, with the voice adopting the \"growl\" technique and soloing as an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a tone color enhancer is a hallmark of his compositional style. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year after \"Creole Love Call,\" he combines his mastery of orchestration with a keen ear for tone color. The call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound. Similarly, in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to great effect, introducing the melody in a way that showcases his unique style.",
            "She couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness that had been plaguing her since she was 14. It was a void that she couldn't quite put her finger on, and it had been lingering for three years, despite her growing into her teenage years. As she entered her late teens, she found herself searching for something more substantial than material things. Yet, despite being in her early 17, she hadn't found anyone who piqued her interest. She often found herself wondering what could be causing this peculiar phenomenon in a teenage girl. Her theories and contemplations over the years had yielded nothing concrete, leaving her questioning her own desires.\n\nIn her daily life, she was fortunate to have a peaceful and loving family environment. Her parents were calm and level-headed, hardly ever disagreeing with each other, and rarely clashing with their daughter. The only time they would argue was when she tried to assert her independence and free-spirited nature, which often put her at odds with their more reserved personalities. Today, however, was not a typical day. As she wandered from room to room in search of inspiration, she was startled by a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen, followed by her mother's frantic voice. Panicked, she rushed into the room to find her mother lying on the ground, writhing in pain and repeating \"Ow\" in short, pained gasps. Her daughter rushed to her side and took her hand, trying to offer assistance. \"Mom, what's wrong?\" she asked, her voice laced with concern. \"I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother gasped, her words rushed and labored. Her daughter quickly sprang into action, helping her mother to the car and driving her to the hospital.\n\nUpon arrival, the hospital's familiar scents of disinfectant and antiseptic hit her, but her focus remained on helping her mother. She quickly called for medical attention and sat anxiously as the doctors and nurses rushed to attend to her mother's injuries. It turned out that her mother had fallen off a stepping stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to investigate the relationship between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality. The study focused on a modified version of the Med diet, known as the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet\", which features higher consumption of plant foods, monounsaturated fats, and fish, as well as lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake was also allowed.\n\nPrevious research has demonstrated an inverse association between Med diet adherence and total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, with one study showing the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, prior studies did not specifically examine the relationship between Med diet adherence and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nA prospective cohort study involving 74,886 women aged 38-63, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states, was conducted. The study spanned 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, during which time the authors calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) six times. Over 95% of the nurses remained in the study throughout this period. The FFQs were validated, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical records, hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo minimize individual variability and capture long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated, averaging scores from two prior years. The authors controlled for potential confounders, including age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe results showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States faced a severe economic downturn, marked by high unemployment, a crumbling housing market, and the downfall of several major corporations. This prolonged recession has raised crucial questions: how did this crisis unfold, and what steps can we take to prevent it from happening again? In a nutshell, the financial crisis was sparked by reckless and uninformed decision-making by politicians that led banks and companies to issue sub-prime loans into a fragile financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were coerced into underwriting and repackaging these mortgages into complex securities, which ultimately led to a chain reaction of financial chaos. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were left scrambling, transferring the fallout onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold and on to the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis date back to the late 1990s, when President Clinton was seeking re-election. To boost his popularity, his administration relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the impending sub-prime crisis seven years later. New York Times journalist Steven Holmes reported in 1999, \"Fannie Mae, the country's largest mortgage underwriter, was under intense pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand lending to low- and moderate-income borrowers, while also meeting shareholder expectations for high profits.\" Holmes astutely predicted the consequences of these actions: \"However, the government-subsidized corporation might encounter trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to the savings and loan industry crisis of the 1980s.\" As outlined earlier, these ill-conceived lending practices would ultimately lead to a catastrophic economic collapse.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the increasingly complex mortgage system. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were overused in the years leading up to the crisis, entangling various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets becoming severely over-indebted and vulnerable to even minor changes in housing prices. The housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities reeling. By 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, representing around 30% of the country's GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at rock-bottom prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transform into commercial banks subject to strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie were saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "You know that part in your story where you let your writer's imagination run wild and take flight, only to risk losing your readers to a sea of unnecessary details? That's what I'm talking about - the dreaded exposition. It's the section where your readers' eyes glaze over, and they're secretly hitting the \"Back\" button on their browser. Dr. Merlin, for one, has been known to mutter to herself at the screen when she finds herself bogged down in too much information - and not in the fun way.\n\nExposition can be a major pitfall for writers. Even those who know the mantra \"Show, don't tell\" can still fall into the trap of lengthy passages that don't advance the plot. It's like having two devils on your shoulder: one telling you to get the backstory out of the way so you can get to the good stuff, and the other urging you to share every last detail about your characters' childhoods.\n\nSo, what exactly is exposition? It's the process of telling your audience what happened, often in straightforward language. Think of it like a film's info dump, where one character lays out a whole chunk of backstory to another. In fiction, it's when the author does the telling rather than showing.\n\nLet's take an example. Imagine you're reading a story, and the heroine is telling you that she met her beloved at such-and-such a place and time, got married in a fancy ceremony, and then her husband was tragically murdered in front of her. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, would you? You'd expect the author to flesh out the husband's character, showing how much he loved his wife through his words and actions. Similarly, you'd expect the heroine to reveal her feelings about him through her thoughts, words, and actions. This would help you connect with her on a deeper level and mourn her loss when her husband dies.\n\nIn short, you want to add meat to the bare bones of the storyline. Instead of just telling your readers \"They met, they married, he died,\" you want to give them a richer understanding of the characters and their relationship. As a writer, it's your job to provide that depth. So, the next time you're tempted to rush through a scene, remember: a little exposition can go a long way, but too much can leave your readers yawning.",
            "I recently watched two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio, and my observations have left me with some thoughts. The first one was NBC 4's live broadcast on August 13, 2011. The lead story was about a disturbing incident in Ashley, Ohio, where a man named Shad Hostettler had stabbed his wife. The news team showed his mug shot, and his expression seemed sinister. Although the story was still developing, I think they allocated the right amount of time to it, around two minutes. The details provided were limited to his arrest and the fact that he stabbed his wife multiple times.\n\nThe second story was about an early morning shooting that left Travis Buyers, 18, critically injured in the Sharon Woods area. Despite the severity of the incident, no arrests had been made at the time, and no suspects were identified. I couldn't help but notice that the story seemed rushed, and I believe it might be a result of the fact that the victim was a young black man from a predominantly black neighborhood. I've observed a pattern over the years where crimes committed by minority victims are often glossed over or receive less attention than those committed against white victims. If a white person were in a similar situation, the media would likely devote more time and attention to the story. The stark contrast is striking.\n\nThe next story covered the discovery of a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. The news team provided some details about the location of the incident and the type of bullet used. A .22 caliber bullet from a rifle was identified as the cause of the damage, and Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nThe forecast for the weekend was also covered, with temperatures predicted to remain in the mid to low eighties. The segment was relatively short, but it seemed like a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nAnother story reported on a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie and a sweatshirt. I found it interesting that the news team devoted an unusual amount of time to emphasizing his racial characteristics. \n\nLastly, a story highlighted the case of Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas-based drug kingpin who had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana in Ohio. I couldn't help but wonder why the news team chose to mention his ethnicity, as it seemed irrelevant to the story. The use of the term \"300 months\" instead of \"25 years\" also caught my attention, and I'm not sure what the reasoning behind it was.",
            "There's a bond between brothers – an unbreakable, unshakeable connection that transcends even the deepest of emotions. Within that bond, a complex web of feelings unfolds: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, to name a few. Brothers have a unique understanding of one another, a connection that can only be truly grasped by those who've experienced it firsthand. When things take a turn for the worse, the true nature of this bond shines through, whether it's love, loyalty, or malevolence. These emotions come with a hefty price tag, but they also offer a glimpse into one's true character. When you look into your brother's eyes, you see a reflection of yourself, not as others see you, but as you truly are. Your actions and their consequences are where your true character lies.\n\nThis theme is beautifully explored in James Hurst's short story, \"The Scarlet Ibis.\" Two brothers navigate the ups and downs of this bond, with all the associated emotions that come with it. Against the backdrop of a lush, vivid landscape, their journey is a poignant exploration of the human experience. Bitter disappointment clashes with overwhelming pride in a heart-wrenching climax, and only one brother escapes unscathed. Through the protagonist's direct characterization and interactions with his brother, Doodle, as well as the narrator's insightful perspective, the complex emotions that shape their world are expertly conveyed.\n\nAt the heart of the story is the protagonist's complicated relationship with his brother. He had envisioned a partner to share in his adventures, someone to join him in exploring the world. Instead, he's faced with a brother who's fragile and vulnerable. His resentment and frustration are palpable, especially when he recalls his initial disappointment and frustration with Doodle's condition. He had expected a brother who could keep up with him, but Doodle's limitations were a harsh reality check. Even so, the protagonist's anger and frustration are tempered by moments of tenderness, like when Doodle smiles at him. This shows that, deep down, he genuinely cares for his brother.\n\nThe story raises important questions about the nature of brotherhood and the complex emotions that come with it. Through the protagonist's experiences, we see that the bond between brothers is multifaceted and far-reaching, capable of inspiring both love and cruelty. It's a powerful reminder that our actions have consequences, and it's through these consequences that we come to understand our true character.",
            "The human brain is a complex and dynamic information-processing system.  As technology has advanced from ancient to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also undergone significant changes. People have initially compared the brain to a simple wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently to a computer. However, it's essential to keep in mind that these metaphors have their limitations and can lead to incorrect conclusions. \n\nWhen sensory organs process external stimuli, they convert them into electrical signals. This information is then processed and transformed repeatedly through the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing methods. For instance, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing gathers fundamental information such as color, orientation, and where the object's borders are, ultimately deciding that it's a box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, uses previously made decisions to accelerate box recognition. It might, for instance, help identify the object as a black box rather than a hole in the white background.\n\nOnce processed to some extent, a selective filter determines the signal's importance and which cognitive processes should be made available to it. It's the same as how you can focus on your name being spoken in a noisy room, while ignoring individual blades of grass when you look down. There are many stages of processing, and the results are constantly modulated by attention.\n\nFor the brain to process and store information, it must first be stored. There are several types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with different encoding methods applicable to various sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded based on its structural appearance, sound, or meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained. Research suggests that working memory, which stores information for around 20 seconds, is maintained through an electrical signal circulating through a series of neurons for a short time. On the other hand, long-term memory is believed to be maintained through the structure of specific proteins.\n\nThere are various models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on human subjects' memory retrieval patterns, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts, with connections between them based on their relatedness. For instance, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In his novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley paints a dire picture of a future society where technology and capitalism have merged to create a dystopia. In this world, people are conditioned to prioritize community over individuality and instant gratification above all else. The citizens are essentially pawns in a game controlled by the World Controller, with their every move dictated by a strict ideology. Through the lens of Marxist ideas, it's clear that Huxley was warning us about the dangers of emerging systems in his time. He uses terms like homogeny and reification, characteristic of Marxist thought, to show how people are essentially trapped in a system that suppresses their true potential.\n\nHuxley critiques capitalism by using the concept of false consciousness, where the common person is kept from understanding the true nature of their relationships with other classes in economic terms. They're focused on their own self-interest, oblivious to the manipulation by the World Controller. The lower classes, represented by Delta and Gamma, are conditioned to be driven by their desires for consumption and indulgence, making them unaware of the manipulation. This is a perfect example of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over others. The upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, are aware of the manipulation but don't do much to challenge it, further solidifying the oppressive nature of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, relationships between individuals are superficial and lacking in depth. This could be a commentary on how the rise of technology and capitalism erodes our free will and emotions. Love and extreme emotions are non-existent, replaced by shallow interactions and objectification of others. The fact that characters like Bernard, who are aware of the system, don't challenge it further highlights the complacency of the society. This is a clear indication of the Marxist idea that the proletariat are conditioned to believe they're superior as long as they conform and continue to consume.\n\nBy examining Brave New World through a Marxist lens, it's clear that Huxley was warning us about the dangers of a society where people are controlled by a dominant ideology. His use of Marxist terminology and concepts shows that he saw the emerging systems of his time as a threat to individual freedom and autonomy.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for almost three years now, having completed close to five semesters. For many of us, getting around campus can be a challenge. My freshman year, I was stuck in an East Halls dorm room, which is about as far east as you can get on campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. The commute from my Stuart Hall home to classes in buildings like the Willard building, located near the heart of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather's bad – and bad weather is common in State College. Speaking with an alum who's not much older than me, I learned that the East Halls dorms used to be isolated from the rest of the campus by large areas of unused land. Today, those empty spaces have been filled with sports fields, new buildings, and apartments, including the Creamery and a new health services building. As our campus continues to grow, navigating the campus becomes increasingly difficult. So, what's the solution to this mobility issue? On a college campus, the answer is clear: the bicycle. However, having a bike alone won't solve the problem. We need to ride them, and the campus needs to be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nRecently, I had a conversation with a friend who recently started riding a bike again after a few-year hiatus. He told me that he wondered why he ever stopped. \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Besides being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. With a bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical exertion, you can cover 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off-campus, just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I made this year was buying a bike. Every day, I have classes in Thomas building, which is a 25-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to just 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, but it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or not. Walking has its benefits, but personally, I'm too busy to walk. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That's over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I'd spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and so on. That's more time than I can spare."
