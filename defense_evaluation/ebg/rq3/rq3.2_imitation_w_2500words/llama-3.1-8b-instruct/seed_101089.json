            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I'm passionate about pursuing a career in social work, specifically with the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can make a real difference in the lives of children who have been abused or neglected, and support families in need. My values align with the social work field, and I want to uphold the following principles: service, respect, an ethical approach, and a commitment to strengthening relationships and personal growth. These values are not just essential for social workers, but also for me, as a person.\n\nI've always been driven to help others, but I wasn't sure which career path to take. Throughout high school and college, I witnessed people struggling with their problems and some adopting unhealthy coping mechanisms. This inspired me to earn a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Although I still wasn't certain about my career path, I decided to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, I had a life-changing experience when a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was escaping his abusive parents. The next day, he contacted the police, and I visited his parents' house to express my concerns. I told the police about my Psychology degree and offered to speak with the parents, as there was nothing the law could do at that point. When I questioned them, they seemed defensive and made excuses for their son's actions. This encounter made me realize the importance of a career in social work, where I can help children and families in similar situations.\n\nAnother crucial value for me in the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuality, but our actions often suggest that we prioritize conformity. I believe in embracing my uniqueness and not limiting myself to societal expectations. Throughout my high school and college years, I've been an advocate for social justice, expressing myself through my appearance, my involvement with the GSBA, and my efforts to combat racism and discrimination. I plan to continue fighting for social justice in my career as a social worker.",
            "The following paper delves into the relationship between the biological and sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on the genetic and medical aspects of health, while the sociocultural model examines the environmental factors that influence sleep patterns. This paper reviews research related to these models and critiques their strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental health condition, or a sleep disorder resulting from other medical complications. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias and Parasomnias. Dyssonmias encompass a range of sleep disorders, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy, on the other hand, is marked by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep.\n\nResearch in the biological model suggests that genes and heritable factors play a significant role in sleep disorders. Studies have shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, which contain orexin, are responsible for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study involving mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are essential for sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, was found to increase sleep time in mice, implying that genetic and environmental factors contribute to physical GABAB receptors in humans. This has significant implications for understanding the biological basis of insomnia and the potential for treatments that target this receptor.\n\nThe sociocultural model, on the other hand, examines how environmental factors, such as demographics, socioeconomic status, and ethnic background, influence sleep patterns. Research in this area suggests that these factors can have a significant impact on an individual's ability to sleep. For example, studies have shown that individuals from certain ethnic backgrounds are more likely to experience insomnia due to cultural factors, such as dietary habits and sleep environments. Additionally, socioeconomic status can also play a role in sleep patterns, with individuals from lower-income backgrounds experiencing more sleep disturbances.\n\nIn conclusion, the biological and sociocultural models provide complementary perspectives on the disorder insomnia. The biological model highlights the genetic and medical aspects of health, while the sociocultural model examines the environmental factors that influence sleep patterns. By understanding the complex interplay between these factors, researchers and clinicians can develop more effective treatments for insomnia and improve the quality of life for individuals affected by this disorder.",
            "This paper delves into the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), exploring three key areas. Firstly, we'll provide a concise definition of the disorder, illuminating its core aspects. Next, we'll delve into the diagnostic process, highlighting common characteristics or 'red flags' indicative of CAPD. Finally, we'll conclude by discussing practical ways a teacher can support a student with CAPD in a mainstream classroom environment.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) is a complex condition that affects the central nervous system's (CNS) efficiency in processing auditory information. Simply put, it's a disorder where the brain struggles to interpret and separate auditory inputs, making it difficult to distinguish between sounds, conversations, and background noise (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). CAPD is not the same as hearing impairment; rather, it's a neurobiological issue that affects the brain's ability to process auditory information.\n\nThe earliest recorded mention of CAPD dates back to the 1950s, initially referred to as 'auditory imperception' (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers began developing tests to identify children with communicative disorders, and by the 1960s, they had made significant strides in understanding the condition. Notably, the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari introduced dichotic testing in 1954, and Kimura formulated a model to explain the physiology behind dichotic perception in 1961 (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 further sparked research into CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways, including difficulties with sound localization, sound pattern recognition, speech differentiation, and auditory synthesis. Individuals with CAPD may struggle to filter out background noise, recognize changes in speech, or sequence auditory information (Ferre). They may also experience sound blocking, where one sound is silenced by a subsequent sound.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a systematic assessment of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests, conducted by professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may involve questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors. Unfortunately, there is no single, universally accepted diagnostic tool, and the exact cause of CAPD remains unknown. Diagnostic tests often present patients with multiple auditory stimuli and ask them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while adopting a disguise can be a useful tool for deceiving people, ultimately, it can lead to a person losing themselves in the process if they don't shed that disguise. The challenge with ending a deception, however, is that it can lead to feelings of isolation. Therefore, the decision comes down to whether one prioritizes their own sense of self or their relationships with others. While some people might react neutrally to discovering they've been tricked, others may take offense to the deception and be hurt by it. The topic of deception through gender role reversal raises additional questions, especially the underlying reason behind it. For instance, in Twelfth Night, the character Viola disguises herself as a man to protect herself, as seen in the lines \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). This decision allows her to find temporary safety but also alienates her from the women around her, depriving her of a vital support system. Furthermore, she becomes so convincing in her disguise that Olivia falls in love with her instead of the real Sebastian, as expressed in \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Viola also has to contend with unrequited romantic feelings between her and Orsino, as mentioned in \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nTwelfth Night can be seen as an exploration of how deception can reveal suppressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may have unconscious desires that are brought to the surface by Viola/Cesario's disguise. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because of his masculine appearance or does she genuinely harbor feelings for women? It's likely that this is not the case, as Olivia's character seems to be satirizing those who judge people based on their appearance. This is evident from her swift shift in romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian and her subsequent view of Cesario/Viola as a family member rather than a love interest, as expressed in \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "German colonial rule in various territories is often remembered for its brutal nature, particularly its handling of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, no single term can fully capture the diverse policies and leadership styles employed by the German colonial empire across its vast geography. The provision of education in the colonies also varied greatly. For instance, when the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a significant number of well-educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) stood in stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a significant role in establishing schools and educating locals, in South West Africa, the responsibility for native education was largely left to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government, however, invested heavily in the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule had ended. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate.\n\nSeveral social, political, and economic factors contributed to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper aims to build on existing research by identifying these factors and focusing on new insights into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. A substantial body of literature explores education in the German colonial empire, with many sources written in German during or shortly after the period of German rule. Early works primarily aimed to describe the characteristics of educational systems in the colonies, while later English-language writings expanded the discussion through comparative studies and detailed analyses of specific aspects of education.\n\nOne of the most influential studies on the topic is Cohen's research on education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and highlights the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the relatively large settler population in South West Africa played a significant role in shaping the colony's educational system. Compared to Germany's other colonial territories, South West Africa had a relatively mild climate, although much of the territory is arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflects this, with nearly 15,000 whites living in the colony by 1913, compared to just 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the past century, the classification of popular music has expanded to include an overwhelming array of genres, making it challenging to list them all definitively. Moreover, most genres – rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and many more – have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres, further complicating the matter. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the last 40 years. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, generally focusing on the darker side of the spectrum. Its diversity arose from the realization that it had real flexibility, which people soon exploited to create their own sub-genres, followed by sub-sub-genres, and the pattern continues to this day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal movement has reached a point where it's difficult to determine what exactly heavy metal is, as it has absorbed various themes from other genres. However, like everything else, it originated from somewhere. To grasp the metal music that pervades modern society, one must first understand the metal movement, and why it's a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nIn many ways, metal is a movement defined by darkness. It can be viewed as \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Unlike other genres, metal bands are known for their impressive technical skills, which shine through in their music. Additionally, metal is heavily influenced by drugs, particularly the psychedelic boom in the mid-70s, which led to the creation of crazy, otherworldly records. The music possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which were a departure from the prevailing popular music scene at the time, which often lacked true representation of the darker side of emotions. Later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities present in the Romantic Era. Lyricists like those responsible for the song Helter Skelter, for instance, express the darkness that is a staple of the movement. This song, often regarded as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, showcases the edgier side of the Beatles, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier, darker work.",
            "The life and work of Henri Rousseau predated the Surrealist movement, yet his struggles and artistic endeavors mirrored those of his successors. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is a poignant representation of his internal conflict between conforming to traditional styles and embracing his unique artistic voice. This dichotomy was a lifelong struggle for Rousseau, who yearned for recognition and acceptance within the art world. As a painter, he was torn between the desire to fit in and please his critics, and the need to break free from conventional norms and forge his own path.\n\nTo understand the context behind The Dream, it's essential to delve into Rousseau's personal history. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, he was the son of a successful hardware dealer. Despite his humble beginnings, Rousseau's life took a dramatic turn when his first wife, Clémence, passed away, leaving him with only one child, Julia, and a deep sense of loss. He turned to painting as a means of solace and a fresh start, replacing the hardships of his past with a pursuit of artistic expression.\n\nAs a self-taught painter, Rousseau's work was shaped by his experiences as a member of the working class. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized and sentimentalized the peasant class, Rousseau's art reflected the hopes and dreams of ordinary people. His struggles to gain recognition within the art world were compounded by the fact that he began his career at an older age, and was producing works alongside some of the most talented and established artists of the time.\n\nAs author Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, Rousseau's journey was distinct from that of his contemporary, Henri Matisse. While Matisse was driven by a desire to avoid trite painting, Rousseau sought to create works that were conventional enough to warrant acceptance into the prestigious Artiste Français. The Dream, with its dreamlike landscapes and serene subject, is a testament to Rousseau's enduring struggle to reconcile his artistic vision with the expectations of the art world.",
            "Many profound thinkers have pondered the intricate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. In my opinion, there's a fundamental reason behind this connection. John Keats' \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" beautifully captures this idea, stating, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience, we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics in a way that transcends these conventional channels. As Keats suggests, both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than prescribe, striving to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior. \n\nIn essence, criticism of art or morals can never fully grasp the essence of what's good or beautiful. For instance, discussing the worth of the Mona Lisa might center on concepts like composition, context, or symbolism, but ultimately, these factors don't convey why it's considered great art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more complex explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be reduced to a simple description of their qualities. Flannery O'Connor's words come to mind: \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we analyze the properties of a work of literature, there's an intangible quality that remains. This is also true for ethics, as Wittgenstein said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that this \"something\" – this je ne sais quoi – is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and their transcendental nature provides a common ground between them.\n\nIn my opinion, morality and art are closely related because we experience both at a profound, noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean notes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a powerhouse today, a united country with a unique blend of cultures that stretch from the alps in München to the Baltic sea city of Kiel, and from the Rhine river city of Köln to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. This rich cultural heritage shouldn't be surprising, given the country's diverse origins. Germany's history is a patchwork of different tribes and influences, with its ancestral land being known as Germania.\n\nThe origins of the name \"Germany\" are a topic of debate among historians and scholars. According to the Roman historian Tacitus, it may have come from the Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gaulish forces. Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he battled the Gauls and Germanic tribes who crossed the Rhine under dubious pretenses. Caesar took this term from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the unvanquished Germanic tribes. Some scholars believe the name \"Germany\" came from the Gaulish language, referring to a neighbor or a neighboring tribe.\n\nAlternatively, others propose that the name \"Germany\" is derived from the spear used by the Germanic warriors, known as a \"ger\" in Old English, or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which suggested the Germans were loud and boisterous. In his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98, Tacitus described the Germans as a distinct people, untouched by immigration or intermarriage with other races. He noted that the Romans would not have left their empire to settle in the harsh, unforgiving land of Germania, unless it was their ancestral home.\n\nThe Germanic tribes did indeed live on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills in exchange for Roman favors and military service. As the Roman Empire expanded, the Germanic tribes played a significant role in its borders, with some even serving in the Roman army. The legacy of these early interactions continues to shape Germany's identity today, a testament to the country's rich and complex history.",
            "I stood frozen, my mind a complete blank slate, as I took in the sight before me.  Emotions were nonexistent, my thoughts zipping in and out of my mind faster than I could grasp them.  It was as if I was merely a spectator, observing the scene without any personal connection to it.  The experience was almost surreal, like my consciousness was a liquid, effortlessly flowing from one thought to the next without any real attachment.\n\nI'd purchased an art instruction book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" after a suggestion from a fellow artist.  I'd always been fascinated by drawing since I was six years old, and this book promised to teach me the fundamentals of art, from understanding the basics of a pencil to the brain's processes for interpreting lines.  One technique that stuck with me was the idea of placing a square frame around a subject to simplify the image.  This was supposed to transform a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, into a more manageable picture.\n\nAs I stared at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't quite wrap my head around this concept.  I was overwhelmed by the sheer detail, and all I could do was stand there in awe.  If I were to attempt to create something artistic, this bowl was the starting point, the beginning of my masterpiece, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand instinctively found the pencil, my muscles tensing and relaxing as I prepared to bring my vision to life.  Water, calm and serene, reflected my inner state.  But instead of creating something beautiful, I found myself staring at the unyielding brown package in the toilet bowl.  My hand smacked the handle again, frustrated by the toilet's stubbornness.  The package refused to budge, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.\n\nClutching a mop, I frownted, staring at the unwanted surprise left for the bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid.  A few more flushes, and I was left with a tranquil moment to myself.  My hand moved towards the wall, gripped the toilet paper sheet, and began to wrap itself, resembling an oven mitt.  Standing up straight, I bent at the waist, and my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, like a mother inserting a turkey into the oven for Thanksgiving dinner.",
            "In recent years, the alarming number of teenagers dying behind the wheel has raised serious concerns about the safety of our youngest drivers. The stats are alarming, and several factors contribute to this deadly trend. The National Institutes of Health point out that one crucial aspect is that the teen brain is not fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Simple inexperience also plays a significant role, causing a higher rate of fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nIt's no surprise that teens fare worse when driving with their peers, which is often the case. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study showing a clear correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents. This is a disturbing reality that California and other states have attempted to address by introducing temporary provisional licenses that limit driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\nHowever, I believe that provisional driver's licenses are mere temporary solutions. The root issue is that, as a group, the youngest drivers are not capable of handling the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman has found that even at 18, the age of many new drivers, the tendency to take risks for the thrill of it is still prevalent. This is evident in Zuckerman's research, which suggests that most young people under 19-20 years old have a strong desire to take risks. It's logical, then, to delay driving until this urge to take risks has begun to decrease. If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, we can expect the death toll to rise dramatically in the coming years. By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will be hitting the roads, and the consequences will be dire.\n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be relatively straightforward. Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes to begin the learning process, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full driver's license, and a set number of practical driver's training hours would still be required. This number could be based on the current hours required by most states (for example, California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Uniform, national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the nation.\n\nThis proposal is not a new idea, but it's one that deserves serious consideration. By taking a proactive approach, we can save countless lives and reduce the number of teen driving fatalities.",
            "I was browsing through the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, and I decided to check out their trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were a total of 15 films that showcased the creative use of editing to create illusions. My film analysis focused on analyzing the techniques behind these trick films and identifying the unique characteristics that emerged in a few of the later ones. Most trick films from this era are set-bound, shot from a fixed position within a frontal proscenium, and feature long and medium shots, sticking to the traditional one shot per film approach. However, some early 20th-century films dared to break these rules by introducing new elements such as multiple shots.\n\nOne common thread among these trick films is their use of interior sets within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary, never moving to follow characters or objects within the scene. This style of composition drew inspiration from theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. This approach, however, has its limitations, as characters in these films typically only move side-to-side and do not walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right side and move back and forth horizontally, while the camera remains stationary.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also resulted in predominantly long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-up shots were never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This is reminiscent of the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in early films, actors rarely move towards the camera, making close-ups a rare occurrence.\n\nMost early trick films followed the rule of one conceptual shot per film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This approach also restricted the narrative or dramatic use of these films, with most focusing on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts with little story. However, a closer look at the individual shots reveals that a single \"shot\" can be composed of multiple physical shots, joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895).",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a passionate advocate for Republicanism, and his profession as an agriculturalist played a significant role in shaping his views on personal freedom and government. As a result, his opinions on governance were deeply rooted in his dedication to the agrarian way of life. His primary goal was to preserve and promote this system, which he believed was the foundation for all his arguments on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nIn Taylor's opinion, the United States had a rare opportunity to create an ideal system of government, unencumbered by pre-existing traditions. This enabled the establishment of a self-governing system that respected the natural rights of individuals. He firmly believed that these rights were intertwined and that denying one right would diminish the value of the others. Therefore, he argued that the government should not interfere with these fundamental rights. Taylor also believed that in the \"state of nature,\" individuals with physical strength and malicious intentions often held power, but that this should not be the case in a civilized society.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor believed that the government must acknowledge the dual nature of humanity, with both good and evil present within individuals. He adhered rigidly to a dualistic morality, stating that government, as exercised by humans, would inevitably reflect the virtues and vices of its leaders. He defined good principles as protecting private property, promoting agriculture, and discouraging excessive capitalism. In his view, a government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest and avarice. Taylor believed that self-interest was a fundamental human motivation, but that it becomes problematic when it leads to the exploitation of others. A good government was essential to contain man's natural evil and to prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nLike many other Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, limiting the federal government to the powers explicitly granted to it. He recognized that an extensive federal government would be expensive and potentially tyrannical. However, he also believed that a simplistic, literal interpretation of the Constitution could be misleading and corrupt without reference to the intent of its authors. Furthermore, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence to be the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at our data in Figure 17, it's clear that there was a significant drop in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. This was a bit concerning, and it's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason behind it. As winter started to set in at our New England campus, there was a noticeable decrease in people commuting by bike or on foot, which could account for some of the decline. The end of the fall semester in December also meant that everyone was busy with schoolwork, and filling out the commuter log might have slipped their minds. Additionally, the start of the holiday season and the subsequent month-long break for students and faculty likely contributed to the low number of submissions. With classes resuming in late January, it's not surprising that log submissions remained low at that time. However, the low numbers in February were particularly puzzling, and we struggled to explain them. One possible explanation is that projects like ours tend to have an initial burst of energy and enthusiasm, which can wane over time. To combat this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign aimed at reinvigorating the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions. Nevertheless, it was clear that we faced two main challenges: the natural decrease in engagement during breaks, and the cultural preference for driving cars, which is deeply ingrained in our society. To overcome this, we offered various incentives, including gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, and other businesses. It would have been interesting to see how larger prizes, like a new bike or a hybrid car, might have affected participation. Perhaps if we had increased the value of the prizes over time, we could have maintained a higher level of engagement, especially during the low periods like December and January.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security that allows you to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but combines the benefits of an index fund with the flexibility of a stock. Imagine having the diversification of an index fund and the ability to sell short, buy on margin, or purchase as few as one share in a single transaction - it's a pretty attractive combination. What's more, the expense ratios of ETFs are significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some downsides to consider, such as the commission fees associated with trading ETFs. On the other hand, the variety of funds available is quite impressive.\n\nIn this article, we'll be taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and examining its top 10 holdings to see whether the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the individual stocks. We'll also investigate whether there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return. To keep things manageable, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we'll use a simple calculation to estimate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings. The results are revealing: a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's overall Beta, suggesting that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower risk.\n\nHowever, it's essential to determine whether these differences are statistically significant. To do this, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalize them to 100%, and compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF. The results will help us conclude whether a portfolio of the top 10 holdings is indeed a viable alternative to the ETF.",
            "In my opinion, \"Dream-Land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's most impressive poems. This poem showcases Poe's creativity and mastery of language. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, which is a testament to his broad literary influences. It's no secret that Poe was familiar with the works of German authors, particularly Goethe. In fact, Poe's use of the term Thulé is often attributed to Goethe's poem \"The King of Thulé.\" \n\nA close reading of \"Dream-Land\" reveals that Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing is more than just coincidental. Karl J. Arndt's book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\" highlights the similarities between the two poems, suggesting that Poe was, in fact, drawing inspiration from Goethe's work. \n\nGoethe was a celebrated writer, best known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts in 1808 and 1832, the year of his death. Within the second part of Faust lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who is consumed by grief after his wife's death. The poem's themes of loss and sorrow are eerily similar to those found in \"Dream-Land,\" where the speaker describes a dark and lonely landscape haunted by the ghosts of dead friends.\n\nThe similarities between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are striking, and it's possible to read them as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a world without color, where he is haunted by the memories of his dead friends. This is reminiscent of Goethe's poem, where the King of Thulé is consumed by his loss and is forced to confront the reality of his own mortality.\n\nPoe's familiarity with Goethe's work is further evidenced by his reference to Thulé in his other writings, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" It's clear that Poe was deeply influenced by Goethe's poetry, and his use of the term Thulé in \"Dream-Land\" is a testament to his admiration for the German author.\n\nIn fact, Poe's respect for Goethe was not limited to his poetry. He was also a great admirer of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and would have likely been exposed to Goethe's work through various reproductions and translations that were widely available during his time. This suggests that Poe's use of Thulé in \"Dream-Land\" is not only a nod to Goethe's influence but also a reflection of his broader literary interests and influences.",
            "California law makes it possible for a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store to receive punitive damages if the store manager acted with malice. In this case, Jennifer Palmer was injured after slipping on the spill, and her claim for punitive damages may not be summarily dismissed by a judge. To qualify for punitive damages, Palmer must show that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from his actions, as well as demonstrating that his conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin knew about the probable harm of not cleaning the spill because there had been multiple slip-and-fall incidents in the store in the months leading up to her accident, and he still chose to ignore the issue. While it's debatable whether Martin's actions were truly despicable, Palmer's argument is still reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents that occurred in 2009 and Martin's failure to take adequate measures to ensure the store's safety. \n\nThe relevant events began on October 13, 2009, when Rich Wayne, a D&D Markets employee, informed Martin about the applesauce spill. Martin responded that he was on a dinner break and couldn't deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, but he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim. \n\nCalifornia law allows punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” California Civil Code Section 3294(a) (Lexis 2010) defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.

            "I still recall a course I took in Islam at CBC almost four years ago that left a lasting impression on me.  One topic of heated debate in that class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  In my opinion, this question remains more pertinent today than ever before.  Reflecting on the events following 9/11, I've noticed mass media shift from a negative image of Islam and extremism to an excessive display of tolerance for Islam in America.  It's hard to imagine that in 2001 a presidential candidate with an obvious Islamic background, such as Barack Obama, could have been a viable candidate.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet has always fascinated me, particularly given the apparent contradiction between the historical Muhammad and the personality portrayed in the biography.  I had previously learned that Muhammad allegedly forced conversions to Islam, conquering and taking over tribes before forcing them to adopt his faith.  However, the biography presents Muhammad as a humble and self-effacing figure who was misunderstood and humble in the face of adversity.  According to the text, people gradually came to see the truth in his teachings and sought him out one by one.\n\nI've also noticed striking similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad.  One notable example is when he reportedly multiplied mutton and milk, providing more than enough for forty men.  The style of writing used in this account makes me suspect that the authors aimed to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but simply lived a life of truth and miracles.  This kind of flawed narrative downplays the miracle and significance of Jesus Christ's life, much like they're trying to take credit for his personhood and life through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous stories that seem to be part of their agenda to provide evidence of 'witnesses' or how people 'on their own' converted to Islam.  However, many of these stories are presented from a third-party perspective, often several layers removed, which undermines their credibility.  While the authors' intention was to provide proof of the truth of these stories, it only serves to make them seem more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to elevate and glorify Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  However, history contradicts the notion that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Looking back at the teachings of Jesus, it's clear that they were left behind as Christianity continued to evolve after his time.  If we take a broad look at Christian history, it appears that the faith has been moving further and further away from its roots.  Nowadays, the world has become more aware and progressive, and it seems that people are starting to crave a return to the original intent of the religion.  While traditionalists will resist any change, they may not have enough influence to shape the entire movement.  As time goes on, I believe we'll see a growing awareness among Christians of the differences between the original teachings of Jesus and the doctrines that were added over time.  This awareness will eventually lead to a major shift in Christian history, with a movement emerging to strip away the layers of doctrine that have been built up over the centuries.  It may take a while, but the result will be inevitable: we'll see a return to the core teachings of Jesus, unadulterated by later interpretations.  When this movement takes hold in the US and Europe, it will lead to a more uniformity of belief and practice, with people coming together to follow the original ideas of Jesus.  The church as an institution will remain strong, but its teachings will be simplified, and diversity within Christianity will give way to greater similarity.  History is full of examples of great reversals, such as the way that Christianity went from being persecuted to becoming a dominant force in the Roman Empire, or the way that the US moved from slavery to leadership by African Americans.  The next great reversion in Christian history will be a return to the source, undoing the complexities of centuries of tradition and doctrine in favor of a more straightforward understanding of Jesus' teachings.  A key part of this process will be seeing Jesus' words as metaphors rather than literal statements.  So, where did things go wrong since Jesus' time?\n\nLooking back into history, we can see that the foundation of Christianity was actually Judaism, with its monotheistic theology and authoritative Hebrew scriptures.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish population was already divided into various groups, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people.  The seeds of division and complexity were already sown, and it's clear that Jesus' teachings were just the beginning of a long and winding road.",
            "In my opinion, The Jungle is a powerful portrayal of human nature, revealing that deep down, people are inherently self-centered and focused solely on personal gain. This is evident in the way the novel's characters behave, particularly the wealthy factory owners and managers. Their primary goal is to expand their businesses and amass wealth, regardless of the consequences for others. The text describes the devastating impact of their actions, like the pollution caused by the factories, with Upton Sinclair's vivid description of the \"great chimneys\" and \"river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This emphasizes the owners' complete disregard for the well-being of their employees and the environment.\n\nThe employees, on the other hand, are treated poorly, forced to work long hours with little compensation or protection. The owners' primary concern is saving money, as seen in the quote, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" During that era, there were few regulations to safeguard workers' rights, allowing the owners to exploit them mercilessly. The workers were expected to endure the harsh conditions, both in the factories and their living environments, with no support or resources available to help them. The novel likens them to slaves, highlighting the inevitability and prevalence of immorality in such a system.\n\nOverall, The Jungle is a thought-provoking commentary on the darker aspects of human nature and the consequences of unchecked greed and exploitation.",
            "Many authors use various techniques to influence their readers' perceptions and attitudes towards certain subjects. One particularly effective technique is the pairing of adjectives and nouns that don't usually go together, creating a distinct aura around the subject. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully employs this technique in his novel The Great Gatsby. He often applies meaning to symbols and then uses them to convey a specific emotion or feeling. One notable example is his use of colors like white, gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald builds up the significance of white and gray, then cleverly uses it to evoke a particular feeling in the reader.\n\nFitzgerald establishes the meaning of white and gray as uniformity, with white representing a slightly higher and more refined class, and gray representing a more aged and faded quality. He introduces this meaning at the beginning of the novel by repeatedly using both colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are often described as wearing white, creating an image of uniformity. In fact, the only time characters are not wearing white is when Nick is describing Gatsby's party, which is depicted as \"gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further reinforces this meaning by associating these colors with ordinary, unremarkable subjects, such as a \"white chasm of lower New York\" and \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable.\n\nAfter establishing the significance of white and gray, Fitzgerald uses them to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity. This technique is first applied to Daisy, who, after a period of relative absence, is reintroduced as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster.\" This portrayal makes Daisy seem less like a fully fleshed-out character and more like a uniform, something that Gatsby desires and longs for. Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly to reinforce this impression of Daisy as a uniform, using descriptions like a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is renowned for its exceptional agricultural productivity, primarily due to its mild and sunny climate. The region is ideal for cultivating a wide variety of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial in the San Diego area, with many local organizations boasting lengthy waiting lists for organic produce. Organic eggs and milk are also extremely popular among the local community. Many organic farms in the area offer guided tours of their agricultural operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other outdoor activities. This type of operation allows landowners to reap the benefits of government programs while maintaining an environmentally friendly approach that enhances the local wildlife and habitat, thus providing opportunities for recreational activities and educational programs.\n\nIn addition to catering to a lucrative niche market, organic farming offers several benefits, including increased biodiversity in plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming often comes with higher costs compared to conventional methods, including more intensive labor and management to control pests and weeds, as well as fertilize the soil without using chemicals. Organic farms may also experience greater losses and lack the efficiency of scale that large conventional operations enjoy. Furthermore, practices beneficial to wildlife that are unrelated to organic farming, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to create specific conditions like edge habitat or patches of open ground, may incur additional labor costs.\n\nThe scenario presented involves a 160-acre parcel located adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. This property is characterized by a mix of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. The East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan covers this area, which is currently under review. The plan considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher. Others are declining and may soon be listed, including burrowing owls.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years.\n\nTo create a realistic model for a small farmer, I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs that could help mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. I chose an organic farm in the same area as a model for what someone farming this land might aim to achieve.",
            "Understanding culture plays a significant role in any negotiation, and it's essential to approach it with a nuanced perspective. A culture can be defined by what it is not, as much as what it is, and what it signifies. It's essential to avoid making broad generalizations about a culture, such as labeling all Russians as stubborn or Japanese as accommodating. Instead, it's more productive to understand the significance of a culture to the specific negotiation at hand and how it can impact the table talks. When dealing with a foreign culture, one is naturally inclined to compare it to their own, which can lead to misunderstandings. \n\nTo navigate a foreign culture, one must be willing to learn its history, realize its biases, and be open to its perspectives. Rather than trying to change or judge a culture, it's crucial to accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially when negotiating from a weaker position. When on foreign soil, showing respect for local traditions and customs can help overcome cultural barriers and facilitate the negotiation process. \n\nIt's also essential to recognize that culture is not limited to national or international boundaries. Companies within a single nation can have their own unique corporate culture, which can be seen in their dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. For instance, some companies value long work hours, while others prioritize a more relaxed schedule. This diversity can be seen within a single societal culture, and it's crucial to understand these differences before entering a negotiation. Even within a seemingly uniform culture, there may be underlying differences that require attention. \n\nUnderstanding values is equally important, as they provide the underlying reasons behind a culture's actions. If saving face or communal harmony are valued in a culture, a negotiator will not publicly embarrass themselves or their superiors to achieve a deal. On the other hand, a negotiator from a culture that values a hard-driven bargain will not settle for less. By considering these generalities before the negotiation, one can tailor their approach to be more effective. Moreover, learning about one's opponent on a personal level can also contribute to a successful negotiation.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" originates from Psalm 14 of the Bible and serves as the foundation for St. Anselm's argument in favor of God's existence. This notion is also echoed in the writings of Thomas Aquinas, who attempts to prove the existence of a higher power. Given that both authors defend the same concept of God, we'll assume they're both correct in their beliefs for the sake of this comparison. To ensure a fair comparison, let's consider a God in line with the one described in the Bible. \n\nWhile both authors present valid points, I believe that neither provides a comprehensive foundation for faith in God. To illustrate this, let's examine the core of St. Anselm's argument first. Anselm's concept revolves around the idea that understanding and knowing God exists within one's own mind. He posits that because God's existence is inherent in our understanding, we can't truly conceive of his nonexistence. Although his explanation can be convoluted and sometimes confusing, the essence of his argument is that the proof for God lies within one's own consciousness. According to Anselm, there's no need to look beyond our own inner selves to find truth about God, as the existence of this being is self-evident. This idea is often referred to as faith within Christian texts, which accepts the truth without empirical evidence. \n\nOn the other hand, St. Thomas Aquinas suggests that the existence of God can be proven solely through reason and evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This concept would be beneficial in evangelism, as it would allow for the recruitment of new believers without relying on their willingness to accept the unproven. Aquinas presents five logical arguments – change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – to demonstrate the necessity of God's existence. He argues that if you know you're missing a puzzle piece, you can deduce the features and existence of that piece simply by assembling the rest of the puzzle, even if you can't see it.",
            "In the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince destined for greatness was born, who would eventually become known as Buddha. As he navigated life, he rejected worldly pursuits and achieved enlightenment, paving the way for the development of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional branch. The faith is over 2,500 years old and has undergone significant transformations since its inception. This evolution is evident in various aspects, such as the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated, a tradition that doesn't have its roots in Buddha's teachings. These changes span from superficial customs to the core of the religion's philosophies. The Theravada Buddhist community, encompassing both monastics and laypeople, has had to adapt its doctrine over time due to both internal and external influences, some hostile and others benevolent.\n\nTo better understand this topic, let's first establish some essential terms that will be used frequently. We'll refer to internal forces as those generated within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, and external forces as those originating from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are defined as influences that harm or intend to harm the community, often stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. On the other hand, benevolent forces are those that don't aim to harm or help the community, but may inadvertently do one or the other. These terms will be crucial in our discussion.\n\nTo delve into the heart of Theravada Buddhism, let's examine its fundamental principles. Buddhists seek refuge in the three gems: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for monks and laypeople, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka provides the metaphysical foundation of Buddhism. Key concepts include Anatta (the absence of a soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of everything). Recognizing these ideas is essential to breaking the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara, which ceaselessly recurs. Ultimately, becoming enlightened means overcoming lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for laypeople, including the five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in immoral conduct, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances). Monks have even more stringent disciplinary rules to follow. At the heart of Buddhism lies the concept of the four noble truths: Dukkha, the reality of suffering; that attachment causes suffering; and that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico are a prime example of two nations that were once plagued by a longstanding rivalry that lasted for a remarkable 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This tense relationship reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the US successfully invaded and defeated Mexico, gaining control of Texas and the American Southwest. While this was the most significant conflict, there were many other clashes between the two nations that finally subsided just before World War I. \n\nThis rivalry was sparked by fundamental differences between the two countries, including conflicting values, customs, and interests. It's a pattern that can be seen in many other nations that share a border, where rivalries often emerge due to competing interests. The US and Mexico are not alone in this regard; other neighboring countries with similar dynamics include Mexico and Cuba, as David M. Pletcher pointed out in 1977. These nations are geographically close to the US and have historically been at odds with it, whereas other Latin American nations have enjoyed relatively good relations with the US.\n\nOne major factor that contributed to the US-Mexico rivalry was a clash of ideologies, specifically a difference in religious values. As Sally Frahm noted in 2001, the US historically opposed Catholicism and monarchies, much like how it later opposed communism and fascism. This ideological divide was rooted in the distrust between the English and Spanish, which was inherited by their respective colonies, the US and Mexico. This inherited distrust made it challenging for the two nations to establish a harmonious relationship.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), there were 17 significant disputes between the US and Mexico during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these disagreements revolved around territorial issues, including border raids and other frontier problems. The US and Mexico eventually exerted military force to address these issues and bring stability to their shared border.\n\nAs Schmitt (1974) pointed out, the rivalry began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US and the US shifted its focus from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico. This shift marked a turning point in the US-Mexico relationship, ultimately leading to the end of their longstanding rivalry.",
            "It's been 15 years since an unexpected illness took away my ability to work as a nurse, a career I chose to ensure a stable life after a tough childhood. My parents always told me, \"You'll always be able to find a job because people will always get sick,\" a mantra that led me to prioritize nursing over my passions for science and journalism. However, my life took a drastic turn when I turned 46 and was left with no savings and unable to work. To this day, I'm still receiving disability benefits, and after 15 years, I'm left with nothing to call my own. Every day is a struggle to maintain my security, safety, and self-esteem. Despite this, I've come to realize that I couldn't have managed without the unwavering support of my family and close friends. When adversity strikes, we're not as strong as we think we are. \n\nMy point is that life is full of unexpected emergencies, big and small. No matter how prepared we are, some challenges are too great to overcome alone. I agree that we should rely less on the government, but I believe it's more crucial to learn to trust and help one another, rather than building our own isolated shelters. The idea of rugged individualism that American conservatives promote isn't accurate. Our ancestors' success during hard times was due to compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources, not self-reliance. The pioneers who crossed the country in wagon trains didn't make it alone; they relied on each other's help.\n\nBy all means, be prepared. I have my own disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essentials. If you have the means, consider a small farm or a wood stove. However, while being prepared is essential, it's equally important to know your neighbors and build a support network.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in the way they do is a complex one, and there are many possible factors that can influence the direction of evolutionary change. In fact, despite the advances made by scientists like D'Arcy Thompson, who in 1917 noted that even the simplest organic forms are difficult to define mathematically, we are still far from fully understanding the mechanisms behind evolutionary development.\n\nIn recent years, however, mathematical modeling has begun to play a significant role in our understanding of evolutionary processes. For example, researchers have used mathematical modeling to study the development and evolution of mollusk skeletons, taking into account both the growth of individual organisms (ontogeny) and the evolution of entire species over time (phylogeny). Our own research is focused on applying these techniques to the genus Prunum, and exploring how mathematical modeling can be used in combination with experimental studies to shed light on the mechanisms driving evolutionary change.\n\nTo do this, we used X-ray images of Prunum species to identify key parameters that can be used to model different shell morphologies. These parameters were then entered into a software program called CerioShell, which allowed us to create hypothetical shell shapes and interpret the boundaries of possible change in Prunum. By combining these results with experimental and descriptive studies, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the evolutionary history of this group of organisms.\n\nWhen we think about a shell, we can visualize it as a tube that grows over time, rotating through 360 degrees of space. This rotation creates whorls, which are essentially spiral patterns that surround an imaginary central axis called the columella. The speed at which these whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line divides each whorl, known as a suture. In most shells, the last whorl is the largest, while the spire refers to all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the base is the opposite end, with the animal emerging through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The most common view is apertural, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the whorls on a shell, we start by viewing it from the apical perspective and identifying where the first suture begins. We then draw a line to divide the shell into two parts, and count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can also be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal grows its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture, we can use coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, to create a mathematical representation of the shell's growth. This allows us to modify the parameters and alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis, gaining insights into the mechanisms driving evolutionary change.",
            "The trend of neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia has remained stagnant over the past decade.  Despite the country being on course to achieve several Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, its progress in child and maternal health lags behind, falling short of the target goals by 2015.  Various factors contributing to these shortcomings will be discussed below, emphasizing the need to strengthen the overall health system rather than focusing solely on programmatic interventions.\n\nOne area where Indonesia has shown improvement is in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this target.  However, this statistic includes traditional workers like midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complicated pregnancies, leading to a significant number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage.  Consequently, the progress made in this area is somewhat misleading, and more work is needed.  Furthermore, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five being treated by a healthcare professional.  Unfortunately, data on postnatal care is incomplete, revealing a pressing concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarian-section rates remain lower than expected, around 4%.  These rates also highlight another issue - the disparity in access to healthcare services across the country.  While c-section rates are 7% in urban areas, they are only 2% in rural areas, underscoring the problem of unequal coverage.  Access to healthcare services is heavily concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural communities underserved.  The issue of vertical equity is also concerning, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor struggle to access healthcare due to high out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to effectively address the lack of services.  Should Indonesia adopt program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall health system without focusing solely on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children?  While programmatic approaches may seem attractive, as they have targeted, manageable objectives and generate rapid results, there are also drawbacks to consider.  One major concern is that investing heavily in a single area can divert funding and resources away from other critical health sectors, leading to duplication of services, uncoordinated between programs, and increased administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are renowned for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the time period.  However, two novels that diverge from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These works incorporate elements of mystery and an air of the bizarre, traits that depart from the conventions of the period.  This unconventional approach adds depth to the characters within each novel, providing insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist navigates his tumultuous world, his mind becomes cluttered with a multitude of confusing and bewildering ideas.  He finds himself caught in a cycle of flashbacks, reliving scenes from his past.  The memory of the shooting that nearly took his life is particularly distressing, as it still lingers vividly in his mind.  This event has a profound impact on Oliver, leaving him feeling overwhelmed and powerless.  The shooting serves as a turning point in his life, as it forces him to confront the harsh realities of his world and the cruelty that surrounds him.  In this moment, Oliver is reminded of the lack of control he has over his circumstances, and the dire situation he finds himself in.\n\nWuthering Heights, on the other hand, employs a different approach to convey the mysterious and the bizarre.  The novel's author masterfully weaves together a complex tapestry of emotions and events, leaving the reader with a sense of unease and uncertainty.  The novel's dreamlike sequences add to the sense of mystery, allowing the reader to glimpse the inner workings of the characters' minds.\n\nIn both novels, the use of dream sequences and hallucinations serves as a means of conveying the characters' inner turmoil and emotional struggles.  These unconventional narrative devices allow the reader to gain a deeper understanding of the characters' motivations and emotions, and provide a unique insight into their inner worlds.  Through these dreamlike states, the novels create a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty, mirroring the characters' own sense of confusion and disorientation.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, the author uses the shooting to highlight Oliver's lack of control over his circumstances.  The event serves as a catalyst for his growing sense of despair and hopelessness.  As Oliver struggles to come to terms with his situation, he is forced to confront the harsh realities of his world.  The shooting is a turning point in his life, marking a shift from a sense of innocence and naivety to one of cynicism and disillusionment.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the use of dreamlike sequences serves to create a sense of foreboding and unease.  The novel's author masterfully manipulates the reader's emotions, leaving them with a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity.  The novel's complex characters and events are woven together to create a sense of mystery and intrigue, keeping the reader engaged and invested in the story.\n\nIn conclusion, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights are two novels that deviate from the conventions of the Victorian period.  Through their use of mystery and the bizarre, these novels create a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty, mirroring the characters' own sense of confusion and disorientation.  The dreamlike sequences and hallucinations in these novels serve as a means of conveying the characters' inner turmoil and emotional struggles, providing a unique insight into their inner worlds.",
            "A couple of years ago, I worked in an after-school program where I tutored elementary-age students, focusing on English and reading, as that's where I felt I could make the most impact. One student in particular, a young boy named Adrian, really caught my attention. He was struggling with reading, but what caught me off guard was the way he pronounced certain letters perfectly while others were completely off. It was baffling. Given that he was of Latino descent, I assumed he was bilingual, but he spoke perfect English. It wasn't until I met his mother, who only spoke Spanish, that the puzzle pieces fell into place: Adrian could read just fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet well. It was a simple yet profound realization, and I hope he's made significant progress since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue in schools, especially in California. It's not always as straightforward as it seems, even for kids who speak perfect English. Reading can still be a major obstacle. We all acknowledge this problem, so what's the solution? In Adrian's case, one-on-one tutoring in English reading was the answer. However, for children who barely speak English, it's more complex. There's no single solution; it involves combining multiple approaches. \n\nThe dual language system, for instance, is a great idea that benefits not just bilingual children but all students. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people worry about the costs and that the majority won't benefit, but that's not true. If we implemented these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all students would benefit. But how do we make it work? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic. Instead, we could have bilingual aids, tutors, or assistants to support students.",
            "As we grow up, we're often told that there's something greater than us, something beyond our comprehension. Some of us are taught about it in Sunday school, while others explore it in their own ways. Many of us stick with the faith our parents instilled in us, but some reject it altogether, convinced that our personal universe is all we need. We may start with one set of beliefs and later switch to another, searching for our own path to spirituality. We're on a journey to define ourselves through our unique perspectives on the unknown.\n\nI'll always remember the conversation I had with my dad about his favorite bird - the cardinal. We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain fall on the tin roof, and watching the plants along the edge of the porch get drenched. My dad was staring out into the rain, a look that was half contemplative, half nostalgic. He'd lost weight and his hair was thinning, but he didn't make eye contact with me. I felt a mix of emotions - loneliness, fear, and a sense of being unable to talk to him about how much I'd miss him. Instead, I hugged him and we sat there in silence, gazing out into the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but it was a hollow victory. I couldn't help but wonder what kind of higher power would allow this to happen. I didn't pray or seek solace in my faith. If God existed, I thought, he'd stopped listening to me a long time ago.\n\nI chose not to watch my dad's passing, preferring to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew my dad better than anyone, and I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to witness his final moments. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news. And when it came, it felt like a punch to the gut.\n\nNo one even bothered to call me. It was as if I was invisible.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is an oxymoron, representing the paradoxical fusion of old and new elements, as Ian Watt so astutely pointed out in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This genre has been both praised and criticized, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others admiring its dark, sublime qualities. The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew upon both ancient and modern romance to create this new literary style. Walpole cleverly combined old theatrical elements with modern novelistic techniques to craft a unique narrative, which he dubbed \"A Gothic Story.\" This blending of old and new allowed the Gothic genre to stand the test of time, becoming both outdated and fresh to readers separated from its original context by time.\n\nThe Gothic genre is characterized by its references to medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term \"Gothic\" was associated with various people, styles, and eras, often conveying a sense of archaism or unsophistication. However, the fusion of theatrical and modern elements enabled the Gothic genre to endure and evolve, maintaining its relevance despite being rooted in a bygone era.\n\nOne of the key concepts in Gothic literature is the ideal of chivalry, which was both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry, the medieval code of conduct for knights, represented the epitome of honor, bravery, and competence. Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, sought to recapture this lost ideal in their work, using it as a commentary on the perceived decline of societal values. Through the portrayal of chivalric characters and manners, the Gothic past was romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the future development of the Romantic movement. In The Castle of Otranto, Walpole's character Frederic embodies many chivalric traits, including his princely status, suffering, and supposed bravery in the face of tragedy. This exaggerated depiction of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" introduces the Gothic trope of excess, setting the stage for the genre's characteristic dramatic flair.",
            "The supply chain management process is a complex web of activities that transform raw materials into finished goods and deliver them to customers.  This concept was first coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described the end-to-end process of planning, executing, and controlling supply chain activities to meet customer demands efficiently. Supply chain management has six key components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Effective managers of supply chains leverage these components to deliver exceptional customer service. \n\nThe production stage is the foundation of the supply chain process. It determines when, why, where, and how products will be produced, and serves as the backbone of the entire operation. To inform production decisions, managers must understand customer needs, which can be gauged by analyzing market trends and customer demands. Once managers grasp customer requirements, they can decide what products to produce, in what quantities, and where production should take place, always keeping in mind the need to meet customer expectations. Efficient production planning is crucial, as even minor oversights can lead to costly delays and inefficiencies in the long run. Companies like Wal-Mart and Target have developed detailed checklists and processes for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks, ensuring smooth execution and avoiding confusion.\n\nSupply is the second critical element in supply chain management. It involves strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its unique equipment, workforce, and specialties. Managers must determine which divisions are best suited for each task and may choose to outsource certain processes to other companies to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver high-quality products while maintaining low costs or reducing costs altogether. By outsourcing, companies can streamline their operations, increase efficiency, and boost customer satisfaction.",
            "Standing on a street corner, Ellen Page, star of Juno, holds a cardboard sign aloft with a haunting message scribbled on it: \"Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\" This stark statement echoes the tumultuous past and present of Burma, a Southeast Asian country ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007, a series of protests erupted, marking the first public demonstrations in a decade. Led by Burmese monks wearing traditional saffron robes, these protests became known as the \"Saffron Revolution.\" Initially, the government allowed the monks to gather peacefully, but the situation soon escalated into a brutal crackdown, with the military invading and ransacking monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were arrested and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27, 2007, simply for witnessing a street protest. Officially, 13 people were killed, but Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army, claims that the actual death toll was in the thousands.\n\nThis is just one example of a long history of governments attempting to quash dissent and maintain control over their citizens. From ancient Roman emperors declaring themselves divine rulers to the Japanese emperors being believed to be gods, the desire for absolute power has been a staple of human civilization. Even in modern times, leaders like George W. Bush have been known to hold secret meetings with influential figures, blurring the lines between public and private interests.\n\nOther infamous examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to challenge the government's authoritarian rule. Official reports claimed 200-300 deaths, but the Chinese Red Cross estimated between 2,000-3,000 fatalities. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups and the Rwandan government systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, is another stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power. The atrocities committed during Hitler's \"Third Reich\" are a chilling example of the devastating consequences of unchecked power and hatred.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz comes largely from his remarkable career span and his remarkable ability to mold his orchestra. Although Ellington's piano playing is understated in many of the compositions featured in this selection, he was a master composer who excelled at crafting intricate and complex pieces that highlighted the individual talents of his band members. By creating a framework that allowed soloists to freely improvise, as well as writing tightly orchestrated sections and phrases that showcased the unique style of each player, Ellington brought out the best in his musicians. This approach not only emphasized the unique sound of the orchestra as a whole but also created coherent and original sounds to match each piece. Ellington's deep understanding of the individual players' sound and how they blended together to form a cohesive ensemble allowed him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's innovative use of the human voice as a 'jazz instrument' throughout his career, citing Creole Love Call as an early example. This slow, deliberate 12-bar blues piece is a great demonstration of Ellington's ability to incorporate voice without lyrics, adding texture and color to his music. Creole Love Call consists of six choruses, each showcasing a different musical element:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response sequence between voice and reeds, with the voice beginning smooth and melodic before becoming rougher towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the main melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band reprises the first chorus, with a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, featuring the reeds taking the lead in a high register, backed by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this final chorus, the voice adopts the 'growl' technique, soloing as an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add dimension to his music is a recurring theme throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year after Creole Love Call, Ellington combines his skill at intricate orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound, blending the vocal elements of Miley's playing and instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) further develops these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had always felt a nagging void within her, a yearning that never seemed to be satiated. This sensation had been present since she was 14, as she navigated the complexities of adolescence. Three years later, at 17, the feeling remained, and she had come to the realization that she was searching for a connection with someone, rather than just a material thing. However, she found herself lacking any interest in the boys around her, who would often try to win her over with awkward attempts to woo her. She frequently questioned herself about this peculiar phenomenon, trying to pinpoint the source of her detachment. The years of contemplation led to various theories, but none that she found convincing enough to solidify her thoughts.\n\nIn her everyday life, her home was typically a peaceful haven, thanks to her calm and gentle parents. They rarely argued with each other, and their daughter was no exception, with them only occasionally disagreeing about her strong sense of independence and free-spirited nature. Her parents' tranquil energy was balanced by her outgoing and lively personality, making her a likable and affectionate person.\n\nOn this particular day, however, her peaceful existence was disrupted. As she moved from room to room, searching for inspiration, she heard a faint scream from the kitchen, followed by her mother's distressed voice. She rushed into the room, her heart racing, and frantically asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Upon entering, she saw her mother lying on the ground, wincing in pain, and repeatedly saying \"Ow\" in short gasps. She quickly dropped to her side, placing a hand on her mother's shoulder to offer assistance. \"Ouch... swee-ty, I... need you to take me to... the hospital,\" her mother stammered, her words urgent and strained. The daughter quickly sprang into action, \"Okay Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mother gave her directions, and at that moment, the daughter was grateful for her previous self-defense classes, which had honed her physical strength. She carefully carried her mother to the car, settled her in the backseat, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought a wave of disinfectant and sickness smells, mixed with an undercurrent of fear. But the daughter's mind was focused solely on helping her mother, and she wasn't aware of the anxiety surrounding her. She quickly ushered her mother into the emergency room, called for medical assistance, and watched as worried faces gathered around. A doctor soon arrived and quickly assessed her mother's condition, while the daughter was left to anxiously wait.\n\nHer mother had slipped off a stepping stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet in their home.",
            "This study aimed to investigate the relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean Diet, as reflected by a high alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the traditional Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes higher consumption of plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is also allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that following a Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and an intervention study found that it was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, there was a lack of research focusing specifically on the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThe study followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort study of over 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) that assessed nutrient intake over the past year. A remarkable 95% of participants continued to participate throughout the study period. The FFQs were validated through various studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by medical records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were not available, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nTo account for individual variations and better represent long-term dietary habits, the researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs (averaging scores from two prior years). They also adjusted for potential confounding factors, such as age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study used Cox proportional-hazard modeling to examine the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and non-fatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nThe results showed that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, there were 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States plunged into a severe economic downturn. High unemployment rates, a collapsed housing market, and the downfall of many major corporations left the country reeling. This ongoing recession prompts a critical question: what led to this crisis, and how can we prevent it from happening again? Simply put, the financial crisis was the direct result of reckless and uninformed decision-making by politicians who forced banks and companies to issue sub-prime loans to a fragile financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured into packaging these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks found themselves short on capital reserves and transferred the chaos to the repackaged mortgages they had sold and the rest of the economy.\n\nThe seeds of the financial crisis were sown in 1999 during the Clinton era, as President Clinton sought to secure a second term in office. To boost his popularity, he relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, faced pressure from the Clinton Administration to make more loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers and pressure from shareholders to maintain its high profits.\" Holmes astutely predicted the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, thoughtless lending ultimately led to the economic collapse.\n\nA combination of factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, intertwining more sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets becoming heavily over-leveraged in the housing market, making them extremely vulnerable to even minor changes in price. Eventually, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for about 30% of the U.S. GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a discount, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "The infamous exposition - that dreaded part of your story where you're tempted to take a deep breath, stretch your writing wings, and show off your impressive vocabulary.  However, this is often the section where readers start losing interest and reach for the \"Back\" button, muttering a few choice words under their breath.  Even seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin have been known to let out a frustrated sigh when they find themselves bogged down in too much background information.\n\nExposition can be a sneaky foe, especially when it takes the form of a lengthy narrative that fails to move the plot forward.  We've all heard the advice \"Show, don't tell,\" but it's easy to fall into the trap of info-dumping, where you feel compelled to share every detail about your characters' pasts, no matter how minor.  This can be especially true when you're trying to get the history out of the way so you can get to the good stuff.\n\nIn writing, exposition is essentially telling the audience what happened, often in a straightforward and predictable manner.  Think of it as the verbal equivalent of a Wikipedia summary.  In film, it's often the scene where one character spews out a long, drawn-out monologue about someone's backstory.  As authors, we're guilty of doing the same thing when we fail to integrate our exposition into the fabric of the story.\n\nTo illustrate the point, imagine a scene where the heroine is telling a friend about her husband.  You're told that they met at a certain time and place, got married in a grand ceremony, and were together until his tragic death.  You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, with barely any dialogue between the two of them.  Instead, you'd want to see the husband's character shine through in his interactions with the heroine, giving you insight into their relationship and his impact on her life.  By doing so, you'd become emotionally invested in his fate and grow closer to the heroine as a character.\n\nIn short, you need to add substance to the bare bones of your story.  It's tempting to rush past certain details, especially when introducing new characters or backstories.  You might know that your character used to be in the Air Force, is the night manager of a gas station, and has a secret dream of owning the business someday.  However, instead of dumping all this information at once, try to weave it into the narrative in a more organic way.",
            "I recently watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, which raised some disturbing concerns. The first one I watched was from NBC 4 on August 13, 2011. The lead story was about a violent incident involving a man named Shad Hostettler, who allegedly stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. Although the news didn't reveal her name, they did show a mug shot of the suspect, which was quite unsettling. The story was covered in about two minutes, which I think was sufficient given the developing nature of the case.\n\nThe next story I watched was about an 18-year-old man named Travis Buyers, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. Unfortunately, he was critically injured, and no arrests had been made at the time. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime, but I felt that this story was glossed over a bit too quickly. It's a pattern I've noticed for years: the media tends to downplay crimes involving minorities. If a white person is a victim, the media goes into overdrive, but when it's a minority, it's often ignored or barely mentioned.\n\nThe news broadcast then moved on to a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The investigation revealed that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about the predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned that temperatures would remain in the mid-to-low 80s over the weekend, and this was presented as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nOne story that stood out to me was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, around 6 feet tall, and weighing around 150 pounds. What struck me as unusual was the emphasis on his skin tone and the fact that they repeatedly mentioned he was black. It seemed excessive.\n\nThe final story I watched was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who was sentenced to prison for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio. What caught my attention was the way the news reported his sentence – instead of saying 25 years, they said \"300 months.\" I'm not sure what the reasoning was behind this, but it seemed like they were trying to make the sentence sound harsher. They also mentioned that he was a Hispanic man, but I'm not sure how relevant that was to the story.",
            "A bond between brothers is a unique and powerful thing - unbreakable and irrevocable. This bond encompasses a wide range of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers have a deep understanding of one another, one that goes beyond any other relationship. When staring into the eyes of their brother, they can see their own reflection staring back. It's in the most critical moments that the true nature of this bond is revealed, whether it's good or bad. The consequences that come with these emotions can be far-reaching, and a key part of understanding the complex emotions born of this fraternal link is learning to live with those consequences. When one can gaze into their brother's eyes and see their own true self staring back, they gain a profound insight into their own character. This is evident through the actions they take and the consequences that follow. \n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers embark on a journey that delves into this theme and the intense emotions that come with it. Against a backdrop of a vivid, lush landscape, these two boys set out on a doomed path. The conflict between bitter disappointment and intense pride reaches a boiling point in the climactic scene, leaving only one brother alive. The author illustrates this theme through the direct characterization of the protagonist, as well as the interactions between the two brothers and the narrator's perspective, which conveys the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his perception of the world around him. These influences greatly impact his actions. \n\nThe protagonist's actions can be summed up by one dominant emotion: pride. From the moment he and his younger brother, Doodle, set out together, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had hoped for a brother who could accompany him in all his endeavors, learning from him and sharing in his experiences, like holding his breath, running, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp. He envisioned a brother who could join him on his adventures, like racing to Horsehead Landing and perching with him in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. Unfortunately, these aspirations are impossible, given Doodle's fragile health. Born with a severely weakened heart, it was highly unlikely that Doodle would survive, let alone participate in physically demanding activities. The protagonist's disappointment is palpable as his dreams are crushed in an instant. He even entertains the thought of suffocating Doodle with a pillow, showcasing the depth of his frustration. However, his anger melts away when Doodle smiles at him, revealing a glimmer of hope. This fleeting moment suggests that his conviction was not as strong as he thought. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "In the realm of brain science, a critical topic is the human brain - an intricate, creative information-processing system. Over time, as technology has evolved from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also undergone significant changes. In the past, the brain was likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, a computer. As you delve deeper into the brain, it's essential to remember that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and may lead to misconceptions.\n\nThe process of information processing begins with sensory organs transforming physical stimuli, such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light, into electrochemical signals. This sensory information undergoes repeated transformations through the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing. To illustrate this, consider viewing a picture of a black box on a white background. Bottom-up processing combines basic information like color, orientation, and object borders to recognize the box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, uses the decisions made at earlier steps to speed up your recognition of the box, possibly identifying it as a black box or a box-shaped hole in the background.\n\nWhen information has been processed to some extent, an attention filter determines its importance and decides which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For instance, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name even in a noisy room. There are numerous stages of processing, and the results are repeatedly modulated by attention.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded. Different types of encoding are specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to its visual appearance, phonemically, referring to its sound, or semantically, referring to its meaning. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained through an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on how human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Many critics have argued that Aldous Huxley's novel Brave New World is a scathing critique of the dangers of emerging technologies and the capitalist systems that fuel them. Huxley's dystopian society is a stark contrast to our own, where people prioritize community above individuality and are conditioned from birth to pursue instant gratification. The citizens are little more than pawns in a larger game, trapped in a world where they are forced to conform to a single ideology imposed by the World Controller. When viewed through the lens of Marxist theory, it becomes clear that Huxley's work is a commentary on the darker aspects of the capitalist systems of his time. The novel is riddled with Marxist terminology, such as homogeny and reification, which reinforce the idea that Huxley was warning against the dangers of emerging economic systems. \n\nOne of the primary targets of Huxley's satire is the concept of false consciousness, a key tenet of Marxist theory. In Brave New World, the common citizenry is kept in the dark about the true nature of the economy and their place within it, focused instead on their own personal gain. This is achieved through the use of hypnopædia, which conditions people to prioritize consumption and indulgence above all else. The World Controller manipulates this desire, using hegemony to dominate the lower classes and keep them in line. The lower classes, represented by characters such as the Deltas and Gammas, are unaware of the manipulation, literally \"buying into\" an ideology that supports the status quo. Meanwhile, the upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, are aware of the system but do little to challenge it. The novel's portrayal of relationships between characters, or rather the lack thereof, is also telling. Interactions are shallow and lacking in depth, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism has drained individuals of their free will and emotional expression. Even romantic relationships are reduced to superficial comments about physical appearance, further highlighting the dehumanizing effects of the capitalist system. The complacency of each social class in their place within the hierarchy is a testament to the Marxist concept of the proletariat, who are led to believe they are superior as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform.",
            "As a student at University Park for nearly three years, I've come to realize that navigating the campus can be a hassle. My freshman year, I lived in East Halls, which is essentially the farthest east point on campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Getting from my dorm in Stuart Hall to classes in buildings like Willard, located near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially during bad weather, which is a regular occurrence in State College. I recently spoke to an alum who's not much older than me, and they shared that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated from the rest of the university by large tracts of unused land. However, this empty space has since been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to expand, traveling from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. In my opinion, the most effective solution to this problem is the bicycle. However, it's not just about owning a bike; students need to use them regularly, and the campus needs to be designed with the needs of bicyclists in mind.\n\nOne of my friends recently took up cycling again after a few years of not riding. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped, saying, \"Bikes are great – for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is cycling beneficial for your health, but it's also the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical activity can take you 30 miles or more. As a student living off-campus, I now face similar challenges getting to class. I have to travel to Thomas building, which is just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. Buying a bike was the smartest decision I made this year, as it can cut down on walking time significantly. However, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas, isn't always the easiest road to navigate by bike. While walking has its benefits, I'm too busy to walk, and without my bike, it would be my only reliable option, taking an extra 30-40 minutes each way, which is over two and a half hours per week. This is time I simply can't spare."

Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I'm passionate about pursuing a career in social work, specifically with the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can make a real difference in the lives of children who have been abused or neglected, and support families in need. My values align with the social work field, and I want to uphold the following principles: service, respect, an ethical approach, and a commitment to strengthening relationships and personal growth. These values are not just essential for social workers, but also for me, as a person.\n\nI've always been driven to help others, but I wasn't sure which career path to take. Throughout high school and college, I witnessed people struggling with their problems and some adopting unhealthy coping mechanisms. This inspired me to earn a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Although I still wasn't certain about my career path, I decided to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, I had a life-changing experience when a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was escaping his abusive parents. The next day, he contacted the police, and I visited his parents' house to express my concerns. I told the police about my Psychology degree and offered to speak with the parents, as there was nothing the law could do at that point. When I questioned them, they seemed defensive and made excuses for their son's actions. This encounter made me realize the importance of a career in social work, where I can help children and families in similar situations.\n\nAnother crucial value for me in the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuality, but our actions often suggest that we prioritize conformity. I believe in embracing my uniqueness and not limiting myself to societal expectations. Throughout my high school and college years, I've been an advocate for social justice, expressing myself through my appearance, my involvement with the GSBA, and my efforts to combat racism and discrimination. I plan to continue fighting for social justice in my career as a social worker.",
            "The following paper delves into the relationship between the biological and sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on the genetic and medical aspects of health, while the sociocultural model examines the environmental factors that influence sleep patterns. This paper reviews research related to these models and critiques their strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental health condition, or a sleep disorder resulting from other medical complications. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias and Parasomnias. Dyssonmias encompass a range of sleep disorders, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy, on the other hand, is marked by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep.\n\nResearch in the biological model suggests that genes and heritable factors play a significant role in sleep disorders. Studies have shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, which contain orexin, are responsible for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study involving mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are essential for sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, was found to increase sleep time in mice, implying that genetic and environmental factors contribute to physical GABAB receptors in humans. This has significant implications for understanding the biological basis of insomnia and the potential for treatments that target this receptor.\n\nThe sociocultural model, on the other hand, examines how environmental factors, such as demographics, socioeconomic status, and ethnic background, influence sleep patterns. Research in this area suggests that these factors can have a significant impact on an individual's ability to sleep. For example, studies have shown that individuals from certain ethnic backgrounds are more likely to experience insomnia due to cultural factors, such as dietary habits and sleep environments. Additionally, socioeconomic status can also play a role in sleep patterns, with individuals from lower-income backgrounds experiencing more sleep disturbances.\n\nIn conclusion, the biological and sociocultural models provide complementary perspectives on the disorder insomnia. The biological model highlights the genetic and medical aspects of health, while the sociocultural model examines the environmental factors that influence sleep patterns. By understanding the complex interplay between these factors, researchers and clinicians can develop more effective treatments for insomnia and improve the quality of life for individuals affected by this disorder.",
            "This paper delves into the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), exploring three key areas. Firstly, we'll provide a concise definition of the disorder, illuminating its core aspects. Next, we'll delve into the diagnostic process, highlighting common characteristics or 'red flags' indicative of CAPD. Finally, we'll conclude by discussing practical ways a teacher can support a student with CAPD in a mainstream classroom environment.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) is a complex condition that affects the central nervous system's (CNS) efficiency in processing auditory information. Simply put, it's a disorder where the brain struggles to interpret and separate auditory inputs, making it difficult to distinguish between sounds, conversations, and background noise (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). CAPD is not the same as hearing impairment; rather, it's a neurobiological issue that affects the brain's ability to process auditory information.\n\nThe earliest recorded mention of CAPD dates back to the 1950s, initially referred to as 'auditory imperception' (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers began developing tests to identify children with communicative disorders, and by the 1960s, they had made significant strides in understanding the condition. Notably, the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari introduced dichotic testing in 1954, and Kimura formulated a model to explain the physiology behind dichotic perception in 1961 (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 further sparked research into CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways, including difficulties with sound localization, sound pattern recognition, speech differentiation, and auditory synthesis. Individuals with CAPD may struggle to filter out background noise, recognize changes in speech, or sequence auditory information (Ferre). They may also experience sound blocking, where one sound is silenced by a subsequent sound.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a systematic assessment of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests, conducted by professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may involve questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors. Unfortunately, there is no single, universally accepted diagnostic tool, and the exact cause of CAPD remains unknown. Diagnostic tests often present patients with multiple auditory stimuli and ask them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while adopting a disguise can be a useful tool for deceiving people, ultimately, it can lead to a person losing themselves in the process if they don't shed that disguise. The challenge with ending a deception, however, is that it can lead to feelings of isolation. Therefore, the decision comes down to whether one prioritizes their own sense of self or their relationships with others. While some people might react neutrally to discovering they've been tricked, others may take offense to the deception and be hurt by it. The topic of deception through gender role reversal raises additional questions, especially the underlying reason behind it. For instance, in Twelfth Night, the character Viola disguises herself as a man to protect herself, as seen in the lines \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). This decision allows her to find temporary safety but also alienates her from the women around her, depriving her of a vital support system. Furthermore, she becomes so convincing in her disguise that Olivia falls in love with her instead of the real Sebastian, as expressed in \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Viola also has to contend with unrequited romantic feelings between her and Orsino, as mentioned in \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nTwelfth Night can be seen as an exploration of how deception can reveal suppressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may have unconscious desires that are brought to the surface by Viola/Cesario's disguise. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because of his masculine appearance or does she genuinely harbor feelings for women? It's likely that this is not the case, as Olivia's character seems to be satirizing those who judge people based on their appearance. This is evident from her swift shift in romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian and her subsequent view of Cesario/Viola as a family member rather than a love interest, as expressed in \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "German colonial rule in various territories is often remembered for its brutal nature, particularly its handling of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, no single term can fully capture the diverse policies and leadership styles employed by the German colonial empire across its vast geography. The provision of education in the colonies also varied greatly. For instance, when the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a significant number of well-educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) stood in stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a significant role in establishing schools and educating locals, in South West Africa, the responsibility for native education was largely left to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government, however, invested heavily in the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule had ended. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate.\n\nSeveral social, political, and economic factors contributed to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper aims to build on existing research by identifying these factors and focusing on new insights into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. A substantial body of literature explores education in the German colonial empire, with many sources written in German during or shortly after the period of German rule. Early works primarily aimed to describe the characteristics of educational systems in the colonies, while later English-language writings expanded the discussion through comparative studies and detailed analyses of specific aspects of education.\n\nOne of the most influential studies on the topic is Cohen's research on education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and highlights the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the relatively large settler population in South West Africa played a significant role in shaping the colony's educational system. Compared to Germany's other colonial territories, South West Africa had a relatively mild climate, although much of the territory is arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflects this, with nearly 15,000 whites living in the colony by 1913, compared to just 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the past century, the classification of popular music has expanded to include an overwhelming array of genres, making it challenging to list them all definitively. Moreover, most genres – rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and many more – have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres, further complicating the matter. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the last 40 years. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, generally focusing on the darker side of the spectrum. Its diversity arose from the realization that it had real flexibility, which people soon exploited to create their own sub-genres, followed by sub-sub-genres, and the pattern continues to this day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal movement has reached a point where it's difficult to determine what exactly heavy metal is, as it has absorbed various themes from other genres. However, like everything else, it originated from somewhere. To grasp the metal music that pervades modern society, one must first understand the metal movement, and why it's a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nIn many ways, metal is a movement defined by darkness. It can be viewed as \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Unlike other genres, metal bands are known for their impressive technical skills, which shine through in their music. Additionally, metal is heavily influenced by drugs, particularly the psychedelic boom in the mid-70s, which led to the creation of crazy, otherworldly records. The music possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which were a departure from the prevailing popular music scene at the time, which often lacked true representation of the darker side of emotions. Later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities present in the Romantic Era. Lyricists like those responsible for the song Helter Skelter, for instance, express the darkness that is a staple of the movement. This song, often regarded as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, showcases the edgier side of the Beatles, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier, darker work.",
            "The life and work of Henri Rousseau predated the Surrealist movement, yet his struggles and artistic endeavors mirrored those of his successors. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is a poignant representation of his internal conflict between conforming to traditional styles and embracing his unique artistic voice. This dichotomy was a lifelong struggle for Rousseau, who yearned for recognition and acceptance within the art world. As a painter, he was torn between the desire to fit in and please his critics, and the need to break free from conventional norms and forge his own path.\n\nTo understand the context behind The Dream, it's essential to delve into Rousseau's personal history. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, he was the son of a successful hardware dealer. Despite his humble beginnings, Rousseau's life took a dramatic turn when his first wife, Clémence, passed away, leaving him with only one child, Julia, and a deep sense of loss. He turned to painting as a means of solace and a fresh start, replacing the hardships of his past with a pursuit of artistic expression.\n\nAs a self-taught painter, Rousseau's work was shaped by his experiences as a member of the working class. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized and sentimentalized the peasant class, Rousseau's art reflected the hopes and dreams of ordinary people. His struggles to gain recognition within the art world were compounded by the fact that he began his career at an older age, and was producing works alongside some of the most talented and established artists of the time.\n\nAs author Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, Rousseau's journey was distinct from that of his contemporary, Henri Matisse. While Matisse was driven by a desire to avoid trite painting, Rousseau sought to create works that were conventional enough to warrant acceptance into the prestigious Artiste Français. The Dream, with its dreamlike landscapes and serene subject, is a testament to Rousseau's enduring struggle to reconcile his artistic vision with the expectations of the art world.",
            "Many profound thinkers have pondered the intricate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. In my opinion, there's a fundamental reason behind this connection. John Keats' \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" beautifully captures this idea, stating, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience, we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics in a way that transcends these conventional channels. As Keats suggests, both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than prescribe, striving to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior. \n\nIn essence, criticism of art or morals can never fully grasp the essence of what's good or beautiful. For instance, discussing the worth of the Mona Lisa might center on concepts like composition, context, or symbolism, but ultimately, these factors don't convey why it's considered great art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more complex explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be reduced to a simple description of their qualities. Flannery O'Connor's words come to mind: \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we analyze the properties of a work of literature, there's an intangible quality that remains. This is also true for ethics, as Wittgenstein said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that this \"something\" – this je ne sais quoi – is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and their transcendental nature provides a common ground between them.\n\nIn my opinion, morality and art are closely related because we experience both at a profound, noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean notes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a powerhouse today, a united country with a unique blend of cultures that stretch from the alps in München to the Baltic sea city of Kiel, and from the Rhine river city of Köln to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. This rich cultural heritage shouldn't be surprising, given the country's diverse origins. Germany's history is a patchwork of different tribes and influences, with its ancestral land being known as Germania.\n\nThe origins of the name \"Germany\" are a topic of debate among historians and scholars. According to the Roman historian Tacitus, it may have come from the Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gaulish forces. Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he battled the Gauls and Germanic tribes who crossed the Rhine under dubious pretenses. Caesar took this term from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the unvanquished Germanic tribes. Some scholars believe the name \"Germany\" came from the Gaulish language, referring to a neighbor or a neighboring tribe.\n\nAlternatively, others propose that the name \"Germany\" is derived from the spear used by the Germanic warriors, known as a \"ger\" in Old English, or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which suggested the Germans were loud and boisterous. In his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98, Tacitus described the Germans as a distinct people, untouched by immigration or intermarriage with other races. He noted that the Romans would not have left their empire to settle in the harsh, unforgiving land of Germania, unless it was their ancestral home.\n\nThe Germanic tribes did indeed live on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills in exchange for Roman favors and military service. As the Roman Empire expanded, the Germanic tribes played a significant role in its borders, with some even serving in the Roman army. The legacy of these early interactions continues to shape Germany's identity today, a testament to the country's rich and complex history.",
            "I stood frozen, my mind a complete blank slate, as I took in the sight before me.  Emotions were nonexistent, my thoughts zipping in and out of my mind faster than I could grasp them.  It was as if I was merely a spectator, observing the scene without any personal connection to it.  The experience was almost surreal, like my consciousness was a liquid, effortlessly flowing from one thought to the next without any real attachment.\n\nI'd purchased an art instruction book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" after a suggestion from a fellow artist.  I'd always been fascinated by drawing since I was six years old, and this book promised to teach me the fundamentals of art, from understanding the basics of a pencil to the brain's processes for interpreting lines.  One technique that stuck with me was the idea of placing a square frame around a subject to simplify the image.  This was supposed to transform a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, into a more manageable picture.\n\nAs I stared at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't quite wrap my head around this concept.  I was overwhelmed by the sheer detail, and all I could do was stand there in awe.  If I were to attempt to create something artistic, this bowl was the starting point, the beginning of my masterpiece, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand instinctively found the pencil, my muscles tensing and relaxing as I prepared to bring my vision to life.  Water, calm and serene, reflected my inner state.  But instead of creating something beautiful, I found myself staring at the unyielding brown package in the toilet bowl.  My hand smacked the handle again, frustrated by the toilet's stubbornness.  The package refused to budge, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.\n\nClutching a mop, I frownted, staring at the unwanted surprise left for the bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid.  A few more flushes, and I was left with a tranquil moment to myself.  My hand moved towards the wall, gripped the toilet paper sheet, and began to wrap itself, resembling an oven mitt.  Standing up straight, I bent at the waist, and my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, like a mother inserting a turkey into the oven for Thanksgiving dinner.",
            "In recent years, the alarming number of teenagers dying behind the wheel has raised serious concerns about the safety of our youngest drivers. The stats are alarming, and several factors contribute to this deadly trend. The National Institutes of Health point out that one crucial aspect is that the teen brain is not fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Simple inexperience also plays a significant role, causing a higher rate of fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nIt's no surprise that teens fare worse when driving with their peers, which is often the case. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study showing a clear correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents. This is a disturbing reality that California and other states have attempted to address by introducing temporary provisional licenses that limit driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\nHowever, I believe that provisional driver's licenses are mere temporary solutions. The root issue is that, as a group, the youngest drivers are not capable of handling the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman has found that even at 18, the age of many new drivers, the tendency to take risks for the thrill of it is still prevalent. This is evident in Zuckerman's research, which suggests that most young people under 19-20 years old have a strong desire to take risks. It's logical, then, to delay driving until this urge to take risks has begun to decrease. If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, we can expect the death toll to rise dramatically in the coming years. By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will be hitting the roads, and the consequences will be dire.\n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be relatively straightforward. Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes to begin the learning process, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full driver's license, and a set number of practical driver's training hours would still be required. This number could be based on the current hours required by most states (for example, California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Uniform, national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the nation.\n\nThis proposal is not a new idea, but it's one that deserves serious consideration. By taking a proactive approach, we can save countless lives and reduce the number of teen driving fatalities.",
            "I was browsing through the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, and I decided to check out their trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were a total of 15 films that showcased the creative use of editing to create illusions. My film analysis focused on analyzing the techniques behind these trick films and identifying the unique characteristics that emerged in a few of the later ones. Most trick films from this era are set-bound, shot from a fixed position within a frontal proscenium, and feature long and medium shots, sticking to the traditional one shot per film approach. However, some early 20th-century films dared to break these rules by introducing new elements such as multiple shots.\n\nOne common thread among these trick films is their use of interior sets within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary, never moving to follow characters or objects within the scene. This style of composition drew inspiration from theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. This approach, however, has its limitations, as characters in these films typically only move side-to-side and do not walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right side and move back and forth horizontally, while the camera remains stationary.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also resulted in predominantly long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-up shots were never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This is reminiscent of the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in early films, actors rarely move towards the camera, making close-ups a rare occurrence.\n\nMost early trick films followed the rule of one conceptual shot per film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This approach also restricted the narrative or dramatic use of these films, with most focusing on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts with little story. However, a closer look at the individual shots reveals that a single \"shot\" can be composed of multiple physical shots, joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895).",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a passionate advocate for Republicanism, and his profession as an agriculturalist played a significant role in shaping his views on personal freedom and government. As a result, his opinions on governance were deeply rooted in his dedication to the agrarian way of life. His primary goal was to preserve and promote this system, which he believed was the foundation for all his arguments on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nIn Taylor's opinion, the United States had a rare opportunity to create an ideal system of government, unencumbered by pre-existing traditions. This enabled the establishment of a self-governing system that respected the natural rights of individuals. He firmly believed that these rights were intertwined and that denying one right would diminish the value of the others. Therefore, he argued that the government should not interfere with these fundamental rights. Taylor also believed that in the \"state of nature,\" individuals with physical strength and malicious intentions often held power, but that this should not be the case in a civilized society.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor believed that the government must acknowledge the dual nature of humanity, with both good and evil present within individuals. He adhered rigidly to a dualistic morality, stating that government, as exercised by humans, would inevitably reflect the virtues and vices of its leaders. He defined good principles as protecting private property, promoting agriculture, and discouraging excessive capitalism. In his view, a government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest and avarice. Taylor believed that self-interest was a fundamental human motivation, but that it becomes problematic when it leads to the exploitation of others. A good government was essential to contain man's natural evil and to prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nLike many other Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, limiting the federal government to the powers explicitly granted to it. He recognized that an extensive federal government would be expensive and potentially tyrannical. However, he also believed that a simplistic, literal interpretation of the Constitution could be misleading and corrupt without reference to the intent of its authors. Furthermore, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence to be the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at our data in Figure 17, it's clear that there was a significant drop in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. This was a bit concerning, and it's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason behind it. As winter started to set in at our New England campus, there was a noticeable decrease in people commuting by bike or on foot, which could account for some of the decline. The end of the fall semester in December also meant that everyone was busy with schoolwork, and filling out the commuter log might have slipped their minds. Additionally, the start of the holiday season and the subsequent month-long break for students and faculty likely contributed to the low number of submissions. With classes resuming in late January, it's not surprising that log submissions remained low at that time. However, the low numbers in February were particularly puzzling, and we struggled to explain them. One possible explanation is that projects like ours tend to have an initial burst of energy and enthusiasm, which can wane over time. To combat this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign aimed at reinvigorating the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions. Nevertheless, it was clear that we faced two main challenges: the natural decrease in engagement during breaks, and the cultural preference for driving cars, which is deeply ingrained in our society. To overcome this, we offered various incentives, including gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, and other businesses. It would have been interesting to see how larger prizes, like a new bike or a hybrid car, might have affected participation. Perhaps if we had increased the value of the prizes over time, we could have maintained a higher level of engagement, especially during the low periods like December and January.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security that allows you to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but combines the benefits of an index fund with the flexibility of a stock. Imagine having the diversification of an index fund and the ability to sell short, buy on margin, or purchase as few as one share in a single transaction - it's a pretty attractive combination. What's more, the expense ratios of ETFs are significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some downsides to consider, such as the commission fees associated with trading ETFs. On the other hand, the variety of funds available is quite impressive.\n\nIn this article, we'll be taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and examining its top 10 holdings to see whether the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the individual stocks. We'll also investigate whether there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return. To keep things manageable, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we'll use a simple calculation to estimate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings. The results are revealing: a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's overall Beta, suggesting that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower risk.\n\nHowever, it's essential to determine whether these differences are statistically significant. To do this, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalize them to 100%, and compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF. The results will help us conclude whether a portfolio of the top 10 holdings is indeed a viable alternative to the ETF.",
            "In my opinion, \"Dream-Land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's most impressive poems. This poem showcases Poe's creativity and mastery of language. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, which is a testament to his broad literary influences. It's no secret that Poe was familiar with the works of German authors, particularly Goethe. In fact, Poe's use of the term Thulé is often attributed to Goethe's poem \"The King of Thulé.\" \n\nA close reading of \"Dream-Land\" reveals that Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing is more than just coincidental. Karl J. Arndt's book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\" highlights the similarities between the two poems, suggesting that Poe was, in fact, drawing inspiration from Goethe's work. \n\nGoethe was a celebrated writer, best known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts in 1808 and 1832, the year of his death. Within the second part of Faust lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who is consumed by grief after his wife's death. The poem's themes of loss and sorrow are eerily similar to those found in \"Dream-Land,\" where the speaker describes a dark and lonely landscape haunted by the ghosts of dead friends.\n\nThe similarities between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are striking, and it's possible to read them as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a world without color, where he is haunted by the memories of his dead friends. This is reminiscent of Goethe's poem, where the King of Thulé is consumed by his loss and is forced to confront the reality of his own mortality.\n\nPoe's familiarity with Goethe's work is further evidenced by his reference to Thulé in his other writings, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" It's clear that Poe was deeply influenced by Goethe's poetry, and his use of the term Thulé in \"Dream-Land\" is a testament to his admiration for the German author.\n\nIn fact, Poe's respect for Goethe was not limited to his poetry. He was also a great admirer of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and would have likely been exposed to Goethe's work through various reproductions and translations that were widely available during his time. This suggests that Poe's use of Thulé in \"Dream-Land\" is not only a nod to Goethe's influence but also a reflection of his broader literary interests and influences.",
            "California law makes it possible for a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store to receive punitive damages if the store manager acted with malice. In this case, Jennifer Palmer was injured after slipping on the spill, and her claim for punitive damages may not be summarily dismissed by a judge. To qualify for punitive damages, Palmer must show that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from his actions, as well as demonstrating that his conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin knew about the probable harm of not cleaning the spill because there had been multiple slip-and-fall incidents in the store in the months leading up to her accident, and he still chose to ignore the issue. While it's debatable whether Martin's actions were truly despicable, Palmer's argument is still reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents that occurred in 2009 and Martin's failure to take adequate measures to ensure the store's safety. \n\nThe relevant events began on October 13, 2009, when Rich Wayne, a D&D Markets employee, informed Martin about the applesauce spill. Martin responded that he was on a dinner break and couldn't deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, but he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim. \n\nCalifornia law allows punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” California Civil Code Section 3294(a) (Lexis 2010) defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.

            "I still recall a course I took in Islam at CBC almost four years ago that left a lasting impression on me.  One topic of heated debate in that class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  In my opinion, this question remains more pertinent today than ever before.  Reflecting on the events following 9/11, I've noticed mass media shift from a negative image of Islam and extremism to an excessive display of tolerance for Islam in America.  It's hard to imagine that in 2001 a presidential candidate with an obvious Islamic background, such as Barack Obama, could have been a viable candidate.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet has always fascinated me, particularly given the apparent contradiction between the historical Muhammad and the personality portrayed in the biography.  I had previously learned that Muhammad allegedly forced conversions to Islam, conquering and taking over tribes before forcing them to adopt his faith.  However, the biography presents Muhammad as a humble and self-effacing figure who was misunderstood and humble in the face of adversity.  According to the text, people gradually came to see the truth in his teachings and sought him out one by one.\n\nI've also noticed striking similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad.  One notable example is when he reportedly multiplied mutton and milk, providing more than enough for forty men.  The style of writing used in this account makes me suspect that the authors aimed to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but simply lived a life of truth and miracles.  This kind of flawed narrative downplays the miracle and significance of Jesus Christ's life, much like they're trying to take credit for his personhood and life through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous stories that seem to be part of their agenda to provide evidence of 'witnesses' or how people 'on their own' converted to Islam.  However, many of these stories are presented from a third-party perspective, often several layers removed, which undermines their credibility.  While the authors' intention was to provide proof of the truth of these stories, it only serves to make them seem more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to elevate and glorify Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  However, history contradicts the notion that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Looking back at the teachings of Jesus, it's clear that they were left behind as Christianity continued to evolve after his time.  If we take a broad look at Christian history, it appears that the faith has been moving further and further away from its roots.  Nowadays, the world has become more aware and progressive, and it seems that people are starting to crave a return to the original intent of the religion.  While traditionalists will resist any change, they may not have enough influence to shape the entire movement.  As time goes on, I believe we'll see a growing awareness among Christians of the differences between the original teachings of Jesus and the doctrines that were added over time.  This awareness will eventually lead to a major shift in Christian history, with a movement emerging to strip away the layers of doctrine that have been built up over the centuries.  It may take a while, but the result will be inevitable: we'll see a return to the core teachings of Jesus, unadulterated by later interpretations.  When this movement takes hold in the US and Europe, it will lead to a more uniformity of belief and practice, with people coming together to follow the original ideas of Jesus.  The church as an institution will remain strong, but its teachings will be simplified, and diversity within Christianity will give way to greater similarity.  History is full of examples of great reversals, such as the way that Christianity went from being persecuted to becoming a dominant force in the Roman Empire, or the way that the US moved from slavery to leadership by African Americans.  The next great reversion in Christian history will be a return to the source, undoing the complexities of centuries of tradition and doctrine in favor of a more straightforward understanding of Jesus' teachings.  A key part of this process will be seeing Jesus' words as metaphors rather than literal statements.  So, where did things go wrong since Jesus' time?\n\nLooking back into history, we can see that the foundation of Christianity was actually Judaism, with its monotheistic theology and authoritative Hebrew scriptures.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish population was already divided into various groups, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people.  The seeds of division and complexity were already sown, and it's clear that Jesus' teachings were just the beginning of a long and winding road.",
            "In my opinion, The Jungle is a powerful portrayal of human nature, revealing that deep down, people are inherently self-centered and focused solely on personal gain. This is evident in the way the novel's characters behave, particularly the wealthy factory owners and managers. Their primary goal is to expand their businesses and amass wealth, regardless of the consequences for others. The text describes the devastating impact of their actions, like the pollution caused by the factories, with Upton Sinclair's vivid description of the \"great chimneys\" and \"river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This emphasizes the owners' complete disregard for the well-being of their employees and the environment.\n\nThe employees, on the other hand, are treated poorly, forced to work long hours with little compensation or protection. The owners' primary concern is saving money, as seen in the quote, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" During that era, there were few regulations to safeguard workers' rights, allowing the owners to exploit them mercilessly. The workers were expected to endure the harsh conditions, both in the factories and their living environments, with no support or resources available to help them. The novel likens them to slaves, highlighting the inevitability and prevalence of immorality in such a system.\n\nOverall, The Jungle is a thought-provoking commentary on the darker aspects of human nature and the consequences of unchecked greed and exploitation.",
            "Many authors use various techniques to influence their readers' perceptions and attitudes towards certain subjects. One particularly effective technique is the pairing of adjectives and nouns that don't usually go together, creating a distinct aura around the subject. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully employs this technique in his novel The Great Gatsby. He often applies meaning to symbols and then uses them to convey a specific emotion or feeling. One notable example is his use of colors like white, gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald builds up the significance of white and gray, then cleverly uses it to evoke a particular feeling in the reader.\n\nFitzgerald establishes the meaning of white and gray as uniformity, with white representing a slightly higher and more refined class, and gray representing a more aged and faded quality. He introduces this meaning at the beginning of the novel by repeatedly using both colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are often described as wearing white, creating an image of uniformity. In fact, the only time characters are not wearing white is when Nick is describing Gatsby's party, which is depicted as \"gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further reinforces this meaning by associating these colors with ordinary, unremarkable subjects, such as a \"white chasm of lower New York\" and \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable.\n\nAfter establishing the significance of white and gray, Fitzgerald uses them to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity. This technique is first applied to Daisy, who, after a period of relative absence, is reintroduced as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster.\" This portrayal makes Daisy seem less like a fully fleshed-out character and more like a uniform, something that Gatsby desires and longs for. Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly to reinforce this impression of Daisy as a uniform, using descriptions like a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is renowned for its exceptional agricultural productivity, primarily due to its mild and sunny climate. The region is ideal for cultivating a wide variety of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial in the San Diego area, with many local organizations boasting lengthy waiting lists for organic produce. Organic eggs and milk are also extremely popular among the local community. Many organic farms in the area offer guided tours of their agricultural operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other outdoor activities. This type of operation allows landowners to reap the benefits of government programs while maintaining an environmentally friendly approach that enhances the local wildlife and habitat, thus providing opportunities for recreational activities and educational programs.\n\nIn addition to catering to a lucrative niche market, organic farming offers several benefits, including increased biodiversity in plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming often comes with higher costs compared to conventional methods, including more intensive labor and management to control pests and weeds, as well as fertilize the soil without using chemicals. Organic farms may also experience greater losses and lack the efficiency of scale that large conventional operations enjoy. Furthermore, practices beneficial to wildlife that are unrelated to organic farming, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to create specific conditions like edge habitat or patches of open ground, may incur additional labor costs.\n\nThe scenario presented involves a 160-acre parcel located adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. This property is characterized by a mix of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. The East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan covers this area, which is currently under review. The plan considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher. Others are declining and may soon be listed, including burrowing owls.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years.\n\nTo create a realistic model for a small farmer, I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs that could help mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. I chose an organic farm in the same area as a model for what someone farming this land might aim to achieve.",
            "Understanding culture plays a significant role in any negotiation, and it's essential to approach it with a nuanced perspective. A culture can be defined by what it is not, as much as what it is, and what it signifies. It's essential to avoid making broad generalizations about a culture, such as labeling all Russians as stubborn or Japanese as accommodating. Instead, it's more productive to understand the significance of a culture to the specific negotiation at hand and how it can impact the table talks. When dealing with a foreign culture, one is naturally inclined to compare it to their own, which can lead to misunderstandings. \n\nTo navigate a foreign culture, one must be willing to learn its history, realize its biases, and be open to its perspectives. Rather than trying to change or judge a culture, it's crucial to accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially when negotiating from a weaker position. When on foreign soil, showing respect for local traditions and customs can help overcome cultural barriers and facilitate the negotiation process. \n\nIt's also essential to recognize that culture is not limited to national or international boundaries. Companies within a single nation can have their own unique corporate culture, which can be seen in their dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. For instance, some companies value long work hours, while others prioritize a more relaxed schedule. This diversity can be seen within a single societal culture, and it's crucial to understand these differences before entering a negotiation. Even within a seemingly uniform culture, there may be underlying differences that require attention. \n\nUnderstanding values is equally important, as they provide the underlying reasons behind a culture's actions. If saving face or communal harmony are valued in a culture, a negotiator will not publicly embarrass themselves or their superiors to achieve a deal. On the other hand, a negotiator from a culture that values a hard-driven bargain will not settle for less. By considering these generalities before the negotiation, one can tailor their approach to be more effective. Moreover, learning about one's opponent on a personal level can also contribute to a successful negotiation.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" originates from Psalm 14 of the Bible and serves as the foundation for St. Anselm's argument in favor of God's existence. This notion is also echoed in the writings of Thomas Aquinas, who attempts to prove the existence of a higher power. Given that both authors defend the same concept of God, we'll assume they're both correct in their beliefs for the sake of this comparison. To ensure a fair comparison, let's consider a God in line with the one described in the Bible. \n\nWhile both authors present valid points, I believe that neither provides a comprehensive foundation for faith in God. To illustrate this, let's examine the core of St. Anselm's argument first. Anselm's concept revolves around the idea that understanding and knowing God exists within one's own mind. He posits that because God's existence is inherent in our understanding, we can't truly conceive of his nonexistence. Although his explanation can be convoluted and sometimes confusing, the essence of his argument is that the proof for God lies within one's own consciousness. According to Anselm, there's no need to look beyond our own inner selves to find truth about God, as the existence of this being is self-evident. This idea is often referred to as faith within Christian texts, which accepts the truth without empirical evidence. \n\nOn the other hand, St. Thomas Aquinas suggests that the existence of God can be proven solely through reason and evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This concept would be beneficial in evangelism, as it would allow for the recruitment of new believers without relying on their willingness to accept the unproven. Aquinas presents five logical arguments – change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – to demonstrate the necessity of God's existence. He argues that if you know you're missing a puzzle piece, you can deduce the features and existence of that piece simply by assembling the rest of the puzzle, even if you can't see it.",
            "In the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince destined for greatness was born, who would eventually become known as Buddha. As he navigated life, he rejected worldly pursuits and achieved enlightenment, paving the way for the development of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional branch. The faith is over 2,500 years old and has undergone significant transformations since its inception. This evolution is evident in various aspects, such as the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated, a tradition that doesn't have its roots in Buddha's teachings. These changes span from superficial customs to the core of the religion's philosophies. The Theravada Buddhist community, encompassing both monastics and laypeople, has had to adapt its doctrine over time due to both internal and external influences, some hostile and others benevolent.\n\nTo better understand this topic, let's first establish some essential terms that will be used frequently. We'll refer to internal forces as those generated within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, and external forces as those originating from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are defined as influences that harm or intend to harm the community, often stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. On the other hand, benevolent forces are those that don't aim to harm or help the community, but may inadvertently do one or the other. These terms will be crucial in our discussion.\n\nTo delve into the heart of Theravada Buddhism, let's examine its fundamental principles. Buddhists seek refuge in the three gems: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for monks and laypeople, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka provides the metaphysical foundation of Buddhism. Key concepts include Anatta (the absence of a soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of everything). Recognizing these ideas is essential to breaking the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara, which ceaselessly recurs. Ultimately, becoming enlightened means overcoming lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for laypeople, including the five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in immoral conduct, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances). Monks have even more stringent disciplinary rules to follow. At the heart of Buddhism lies the concept of the four noble truths: Dukkha, the reality of suffering; that attachment causes suffering; and that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico are a prime example of two nations that were once plagued by a longstanding rivalry that lasted for a remarkable 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This tense relationship reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the US successfully invaded and defeated Mexico, gaining control of Texas and the American Southwest. While this was the most significant conflict, there were many other clashes between the two nations that finally subsided just before World War I. \n\nThis rivalry was sparked by fundamental differences between the two countries, including conflicting values, customs, and interests. It's a pattern that can be seen in many other nations that share a border, where rivalries often emerge due to competing interests. The US and Mexico are not alone in this regard; other neighboring countries with similar dynamics include Mexico and Cuba, as David M. Pletcher pointed out in 1977. These nations are geographically close to the US and have historically been at odds with it, whereas other Latin American nations have enjoyed relatively good relations with the US.\n\nOne major factor that contributed to the US-Mexico rivalry was a clash of ideologies, specifically a difference in religious values. As Sally Frahm noted in 2001, the US historically opposed Catholicism and monarchies, much like how it later opposed communism and fascism. This ideological divide was rooted in the distrust between the English and Spanish, which was inherited by their respective colonies, the US and Mexico. This inherited distrust made it challenging for the two nations to establish a harmonious relationship.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), there were 17 significant disputes between the US and Mexico during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these disagreements revolved around territorial issues, including border raids and other frontier problems. The US and Mexico eventually exerted military force to address these issues and bring stability to their shared border.\n\nAs Schmitt (1974) pointed out, the rivalry began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US and the US shifted its focus from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico. This shift marked a turning point in the US-Mexico relationship, ultimately leading to the end of their longstanding rivalry.",
            "It's been 15 years since an unexpected illness took away my ability to work as a nurse, a career I chose to ensure a stable life after a tough childhood. My parents always told me, \"You'll always be able to find a job because people will always get sick,\" a mantra that led me to prioritize nursing over my passions for science and journalism. However, my life took a drastic turn when I turned 46 and was left with no savings and unable to work. To this day, I'm still receiving disability benefits, and after 15 years, I'm left with nothing to call my own. Every day is a struggle to maintain my security, safety, and self-esteem. Despite this, I've come to realize that I couldn't have managed without the unwavering support of my family and close friends. When adversity strikes, we're not as strong as we think we are. \n\nMy point is that life is full of unexpected emergencies, big and small. No matter how prepared we are, some challenges are too great to overcome alone. I agree that we should rely less on the government, but I believe it's more crucial to learn to trust and help one another, rather than building our own isolated shelters. The idea of rugged individualism that American conservatives promote isn't accurate. Our ancestors' success during hard times was due to compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources, not self-reliance. The pioneers who crossed the country in wagon trains didn't make it alone; they relied on each other's help.\n\nBy all means, be prepared. I have my own disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essentials. If you have the means, consider a small farm or a wood stove. However, while being prepared is essential, it's equally important to know your neighbors and build a support network.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in the way they do is a complex one, and there are many possible factors that can influence the direction of evolutionary change. In fact, despite the advances made by scientists like D'Arcy Thompson, who in 1917 noted that even the simplest organic forms are difficult to define mathematically, we are still far from fully understanding the mechanisms behind evolutionary development.\n\nIn recent years, however, mathematical modeling has begun to play a significant role in our understanding of evolutionary processes. For example, researchers have used mathematical modeling to study the development and evolution of mollusk skeletons, taking into account both the growth of individual organisms (ontogeny) and the evolution of entire species over time (phylogeny). Our own research is focused on applying these techniques to the genus Prunum, and exploring how mathematical modeling can be used in combination with experimental studies to shed light on the mechanisms driving evolutionary change.\n\nTo do this, we used X-ray images of Prunum species to identify key parameters that can be used to model different shell morphologies. These parameters were then entered into a software program called CerioShell, which allowed us to create hypothetical shell shapes and interpret the boundaries of possible change in Prunum. By combining these results with experimental and descriptive studies, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the evolutionary history of this group of organisms.\n\nWhen we think about a shell, we can visualize it as a tube that grows over time, rotating through 360 degrees of space. This rotation creates whorls, which are essentially spiral patterns that surround an imaginary central axis called the columella. The speed at which these whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line divides each whorl, known as a suture. In most shells, the last whorl is the largest, while the spire refers to all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the base is the opposite end, with the animal emerging through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The most common view is apertural, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the whorls on a shell, we start by viewing it from the apical perspective and identifying where the first suture begins. We then draw a line to divide the shell into two parts, and count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can also be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal grows its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture, we can use coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, to create a mathematical representation of the shell's growth. This allows us to modify the parameters and alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis, gaining insights into the mechanisms driving evolutionary change.",
            "The trend of neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia has remained stagnant over the past decade.  Despite the country being on course to achieve several Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, its progress in child and maternal health lags behind, falling short of the target goals by 2015.  Various factors contributing to these shortcomings will be discussed below, emphasizing the need to strengthen the overall health system rather than focusing solely on programmatic interventions.\n\nOne area where Indonesia has shown improvement is in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this target.  However, this statistic includes traditional workers like midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complicated pregnancies, leading to a significant number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage.  Consequently, the progress made in this area is somewhat misleading, and more work is needed.  Furthermore, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five being treated by a healthcare professional.  Unfortunately, data on postnatal care is incomplete, revealing a pressing concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarian-section rates remain lower than expected, around 4%.  These rates also highlight another issue - the disparity in access to healthcare services across the country.  While c-section rates are 7% in urban areas, they are only 2% in rural areas, underscoring the problem of unequal coverage.  Access to healthcare services is heavily concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural communities underserved.  The issue of vertical equity is also concerning, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor struggle to access healthcare due to high out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to effectively address the lack of services.  Should Indonesia adopt program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall health system without focusing solely on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children?  While programmatic approaches may seem attractive, as they have targeted, manageable objectives and generate rapid results, there are also drawbacks to consider.  One major concern is that investing heavily in a single area can divert funding and resources away from other critical health sectors, leading to duplication of services, uncoordinated between programs, and increased administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are renowned for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the time period.  However, two novels that diverge from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These works incorporate elements of mystery and an air of the bizarre, traits that depart from the conventions of the period.  This unconventional approach adds depth to the characters within each novel, providing insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist navigates his tumultuous world, his mind becomes cluttered with a multitude of confusing and bewildering ideas.  He finds himself caught in a cycle of flashbacks, reliving scenes from his past.  The memory of the shooting that nearly took his life is particularly distressing, as it still lingers vividly in his mind.  This event has a profound impact on Oliver, leaving him feeling overwhelmed and powerless.  The shooting serves as a turning point in his life, as it forces him to confront the harsh realities of his world and the cruelty that surrounds him.  In this moment, Oliver is reminded of the lack of control he has over his circumstances, and the dire situation he finds himself in.\n\nWuthering Heights, on the other hand, employs a different approach to convey the mysterious and the bizarre.  The novel's author masterfully weaves together a complex tapestry of emotions and events, leaving the reader with a sense of unease and uncertainty.  The novel's dreamlike sequences add to the sense of mystery, allowing the reader to glimpse the inner workings of the characters' minds.\n\nIn both novels, the use of dream sequences and hallucinations serves as a means of conveying the characters' inner turmoil and emotional struggles.  These unconventional narrative devices allow the reader to gain a deeper understanding of the characters' motivations and emotions, and provide a unique insight into their inner worlds.  Through these dreamlike states, the novels create a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty, mirroring the characters' own sense of confusion and disorientation.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, the author uses the shooting to highlight Oliver's lack of control over his circumstances.  The event serves as a catalyst for his growing sense of despair and hopelessness.  As Oliver struggles to come to terms with his situation, he is forced to confront the harsh realities of his world.  The shooting is a turning point in his life, marking a shift from a sense of innocence and naivety to one of cynicism and disillusionment.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the use of dreamlike sequences serves to create a sense of foreboding and unease.  The novel's author masterfully manipulates the reader's emotions, leaving them with a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity.  The novel's complex characters and events are woven together to create a sense of mystery and intrigue, keeping the reader engaged and invested in the story.\n\nIn conclusion, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights are two novels that deviate from the conventions of the Victorian period.  Through their use of mystery and the bizarre, these novels create a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty, mirroring the characters' own sense of confusion and disorientation.  The dreamlike sequences and hallucinations in these novels serve as a means of conveying the characters' inner turmoil and emotional struggles, providing a unique insight into their inner worlds.",
            "A couple of years ago, I worked in an after-school program where I tutored elementary-age students, focusing on English and reading, as that's where I felt I could make the most impact. One student in particular, a young boy named Adrian, really caught my attention. He was struggling with reading, but what caught me off guard was the way he pronounced certain letters perfectly while others were completely off. It was baffling. Given that he was of Latino descent, I assumed he was bilingual, but he spoke perfect English. It wasn't until I met his mother, who only spoke Spanish, that the puzzle pieces fell into place: Adrian could read just fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet well. It was a simple yet profound realization, and I hope he's made significant progress since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue in schools, especially in California. It's not always as straightforward as it seems, even for kids who speak perfect English. Reading can still be a major obstacle. We all acknowledge this problem, so what's the solution? In Adrian's case, one-on-one tutoring in English reading was the answer. However, for children who barely speak English, it's more complex. There's no single solution; it involves combining multiple approaches. \n\nThe dual language system, for instance, is a great idea that benefits not just bilingual children but all students. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people worry about the costs and that the majority won't benefit, but that's not true. If we implemented these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all students would benefit. But how do we make it work? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic. Instead, we could have bilingual aids, tutors, or assistants to support students.",
            "As we grow up, we're often told that there's something greater than us, something beyond our comprehension. Some of us are taught about it in Sunday school, while others explore it in their own ways. Many of us stick with the faith our parents instilled in us, but some reject it altogether, convinced that our personal universe is all we need. We may start with one set of beliefs and later switch to another, searching for our own path to spirituality. We're on a journey to define ourselves through our unique perspectives on the unknown.\n\nI'll always remember the conversation I had with my dad about his favorite bird - the cardinal. We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain fall on the tin roof, and watching the plants along the edge of the porch get drenched. My dad was staring out into the rain, a look that was half contemplative, half nostalgic. He'd lost weight and his hair was thinning, but he didn't make eye contact with me. I felt a mix of emotions - loneliness, fear, and a sense of being unable to talk to him about how much I'd miss him. Instead, I hugged him and we sat there in silence, gazing out into the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but it was a hollow victory. I couldn't help but wonder what kind of higher power would allow this to happen. I didn't pray or seek solace in my faith. If God existed, I thought, he'd stopped listening to me a long time ago.\n\nI chose not to watch my dad's passing, preferring to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew my dad better than anyone, and I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to witness his final moments. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news. And when it came, it felt like a punch to the gut.\n\nNo one even bothered to call me. It was as if I was invisible.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is an oxymoron, representing the paradoxical fusion of old and new elements, as Ian Watt so astutely pointed out in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This genre has been both praised and criticized, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others admiring its dark, sublime qualities. The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew upon both ancient and modern romance to create this new literary style. Walpole cleverly combined old theatrical elements with modern novelistic techniques to craft a unique narrative, which he dubbed \"A Gothic Story.\" This blending of old and new allowed the Gothic genre to stand the test of time, becoming both outdated and fresh to readers separated from its original context by time.\n\nThe Gothic genre is characterized by its references to medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term \"Gothic\" was associated with various people, styles, and eras, often conveying a sense of archaism or unsophistication. However, the fusion of theatrical and modern elements enabled the Gothic genre to endure and evolve, maintaining its relevance despite being rooted in a bygone era.\n\nOne of the key concepts in Gothic literature is the ideal of chivalry, which was both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry, the medieval code of conduct for knights, represented the epitome of honor, bravery, and competence. Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, sought to recapture this lost ideal in their work, using it as a commentary on the perceived decline of societal values. Through the portrayal of chivalric characters and manners, the Gothic past was romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the future development of the Romantic movement. In The Castle of Otranto, Walpole's character Frederic embodies many chivalric traits, including his princely status, suffering, and supposed bravery in the face of tragedy. This exaggerated depiction of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" introduces the Gothic trope of excess, setting the stage for the genre's characteristic dramatic flair.",
            "The supply chain management process is a complex web of activities that transform raw materials into finished goods and deliver them to customers.  This concept was first coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described the end-to-end process of planning, executing, and controlling supply chain activities to meet customer demands efficiently. Supply chain management has six key components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Effective managers of supply chains leverage these components to deliver exceptional customer service. \n\nThe production stage is the foundation of the supply chain process. It determines when, why, where, and how products will be produced, and serves as the backbone of the entire operation. To inform production decisions, managers must understand customer needs, which can be gauged by analyzing market trends and customer demands. Once managers grasp customer requirements, they can decide what products to produce, in what quantities, and where production should take place, always keeping in mind the need to meet customer expectations. Efficient production planning is crucial, as even minor oversights can lead to costly delays and inefficiencies in the long run. Companies like Wal-Mart and Target have developed detailed checklists and processes for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks, ensuring smooth execution and avoiding confusion.\n\nSupply is the second critical element in supply chain management. It involves strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its unique equipment, workforce, and specialties. Managers must determine which divisions are best suited for each task and may choose to outsource certain processes to other companies to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver high-quality products while maintaining low costs or reducing costs altogether. By outsourcing, companies can streamline their operations, increase efficiency, and boost customer satisfaction.",
            "Standing on a street corner, Ellen Page, star of Juno, holds a cardboard sign aloft with a haunting message scribbled on it: \"Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\" This stark statement echoes the tumultuous past and present of Burma, a Southeast Asian country ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007, a series of protests erupted, marking the first public demonstrations in a decade. Led by Burmese monks wearing traditional saffron robes, these protests became known as the \"Saffron Revolution.\" Initially, the government allowed the monks to gather peacefully, but the situation soon escalated into a brutal crackdown, with the military invading and ransacking monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were arrested and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27, 2007, simply for witnessing a street protest. Officially, 13 people were killed, but Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army, claims that the actual death toll was in the thousands.\n\nThis is just one example of a long history of governments attempting to quash dissent and maintain control over their citizens. From ancient Roman emperors declaring themselves divine rulers to the Japanese emperors being believed to be gods, the desire for absolute power has been a staple of human civilization. Even in modern times, leaders like George W. Bush have been known to hold secret meetings with influential figures, blurring the lines between public and private interests.\n\nOther infamous examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to challenge the government's authoritarian rule. Official reports claimed 200-300 deaths, but the Chinese Red Cross estimated between 2,000-3,000 fatalities. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups and the Rwandan government systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, is another stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power. The atrocities committed during Hitler's \"Third Reich\" are a chilling example of the devastating consequences of unchecked power and hatred.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz comes largely from his remarkable career span and his remarkable ability to mold his orchestra. Although Ellington's piano playing is understated in many of the compositions featured in this selection, he was a master composer who excelled at crafting intricate and complex pieces that highlighted the individual talents of his band members. By creating a framework that allowed soloists to freely improvise, as well as writing tightly orchestrated sections and phrases that showcased the unique style of each player, Ellington brought out the best in his musicians. This approach not only emphasized the unique sound of the orchestra as a whole but also created coherent and original sounds to match each piece. Ellington's deep understanding of the individual players' sound and how they blended together to form a cohesive ensemble allowed him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's innovative use of the human voice as a 'jazz instrument' throughout his career, citing Creole Love Call as an early example. This slow, deliberate 12-bar blues piece is a great demonstration of Ellington's ability to incorporate voice without lyrics, adding texture and color to his music. Creole Love Call consists of six choruses, each showcasing a different musical element:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response sequence between voice and reeds, with the voice beginning smooth and melodic before becoming rougher towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the main melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band reprises the first chorus, with a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, featuring the reeds taking the lead in a high register, backed by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this final chorus, the voice adopts the 'growl' technique, soloing as an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add dimension to his music is a recurring theme throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year after Creole Love Call, Ellington combines his skill at intricate orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound, blending the vocal elements of Miley's playing and instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) further develops these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had always felt a nagging void within her, a yearning that never seemed to be satiated. This sensation had been present since she was 14, as she navigated the complexities of adolescence. Three years later, at 17, the feeling remained, and she had come to the realization that she was searching for a connection with someone, rather than just a material thing. However, she found herself lacking any interest in the boys around her, who would often try to win her over with awkward attempts to woo her. She frequently questioned herself about this peculiar phenomenon, trying to pinpoint the source of her detachment. The years of contemplation led to various theories, but none that she found convincing enough to solidify her thoughts.\n\nIn her everyday life, her home was typically a peaceful haven, thanks to her calm and gentle parents. They rarely argued with each other, and their daughter was no exception, with them only occasionally disagreeing about her strong sense of independence and free-spirited nature. Her parents' tranquil energy was balanced by her outgoing and lively personality, making her a likable and affectionate person.\n\nOn this particular day, however, her peaceful existence was disrupted. As she moved from room to room, searching for inspiration, she heard a faint scream from the kitchen, followed by her mother's distressed voice. She rushed into the room, her heart racing, and frantically asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Upon entering, she saw her mother lying on the ground, wincing in pain, and repeatedly saying \"Ow\" in short gasps. She quickly dropped to her side, placing a hand on her mother's shoulder to offer assistance. \"Ouch... swee-ty, I... need you to take me to... the hospital,\" her mother stammered, her words urgent and strained. The daughter quickly sprang into action, \"Okay Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mother gave her directions, and at that moment, the daughter was grateful for her previous self-defense classes, which had honed her physical strength. She carefully carried her mother to the car, settled her in the backseat, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought a wave of disinfectant and sickness smells, mixed with an undercurrent of fear. But the daughter's mind was focused solely on helping her mother, and she wasn't aware of the anxiety surrounding her. She quickly ushered her mother into the emergency room, called for medical assistance, and watched as worried faces gathered around. A doctor soon arrived and quickly assessed her mother's condition, while the daughter was left to anxiously wait.\n\nHer mother had slipped off a stepping stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet in their home.",
            "This study aimed to investigate the relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean Diet, as reflected by a high alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the traditional Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes higher consumption of plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is also allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that following a Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and an intervention study found that it was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, there was a lack of research focusing specifically on the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThe study followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort study of over 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) that assessed nutrient intake over the past year. A remarkable 95% of participants continued to participate throughout the study period. The FFQs were validated through various studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by medical records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were not available, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nTo account for individual variations and better represent long-term dietary habits, the researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs (averaging scores from two prior years). They also adjusted for potential confounding factors, such as age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study used Cox proportional-hazard modeling to examine the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and non-fatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nThe results showed that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, there were 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States plunged into a severe economic downturn. High unemployment rates, a collapsed housing market, and the downfall of many major corporations left the country reeling. This ongoing recession prompts a critical question: what led to this crisis, and how can we prevent it from happening again? Simply put, the financial crisis was the direct result of reckless and uninformed decision-making by politicians who forced banks and companies to issue sub-prime loans to a fragile financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured into packaging these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks found themselves short on capital reserves and transferred the chaos to the repackaged mortgages they had sold and the rest of the economy.\n\nThe seeds of the financial crisis were sown in 1999 during the Clinton era, as President Clinton sought to secure a second term in office. To boost his popularity, he relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, faced pressure from the Clinton Administration to make more loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers and pressure from shareholders to maintain its high profits.\" Holmes astutely predicted the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, thoughtless lending ultimately led to the economic collapse.\n\nA combination of factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, intertwining more sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets becoming heavily over-leveraged in the housing market, making them extremely vulnerable to even minor changes in price. Eventually, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for about 30% of the U.S. GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a discount, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "The infamous exposition - that dreaded part of your story where you're tempted to take a deep breath, stretch your writing wings, and show off your impressive vocabulary.  However, this is often the section where readers start losing interest and reach for the \"Back\" button, muttering a few choice words under their breath.  Even seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin have been known to let out a frustrated sigh when they find themselves bogged down in too much background information.\n\nExposition can be a sneaky foe, especially when it takes the form of a lengthy narrative that fails to move the plot forward.  We've all heard the advice \"Show, don't tell,\" but it's easy to fall into the trap of info-dumping, where you feel compelled to share every detail about your characters' pasts, no matter how minor.  This can be especially true when you're trying to get the history out of the way so you can get to the good stuff.\n\nIn writing, exposition is essentially telling the audience what happened, often in a straightforward and predictable manner.  Think of it as the verbal equivalent of a Wikipedia summary.  In film, it's often the scene where one character spews out a long, drawn-out monologue about someone's backstory.  As authors, we're guilty of doing the same thing when we fail to integrate our exposition into the fabric of the story.\n\nTo illustrate the point, imagine a scene where the heroine is telling a friend about her husband.  You're told that they met at a certain time and place, got married in a grand ceremony, and were together until his tragic death.  You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, with barely any dialogue between the two of them.  Instead, you'd want to see the husband's character shine through in his interactions with the heroine, giving you insight into their relationship and his impact on her life.  By doing so, you'd become emotionally invested in his fate and grow closer to the heroine as a character.\n\nIn short, you need to add substance to the bare bones of your story.  It's tempting to rush past certain details, especially when introducing new characters or backstories.  You might know that your character used to be in the Air Force, is the night manager of a gas station, and has a secret dream of owning the business someday.  However, instead of dumping all this information at once, try to weave it into the narrative in a more organic way.",
            "I recently watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, which raised some disturbing concerns. The first one I watched was from NBC 4 on August 13, 2011. The lead story was about a violent incident involving a man named Shad Hostettler, who allegedly stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. Although the news didn't reveal her name, they did show a mug shot of the suspect, which was quite unsettling. The story was covered in about two minutes, which I think was sufficient given the developing nature of the case.\n\nThe next story I watched was about an 18-year-old man named Travis Buyers, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. Unfortunately, he was critically injured, and no arrests had been made at the time. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime, but I felt that this story was glossed over a bit too quickly. It's a pattern I've noticed for years: the media tends to downplay crimes involving minorities. If a white person is a victim, the media goes into overdrive, but when it's a minority, it's often ignored or barely mentioned.\n\nThe news broadcast then moved on to a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The investigation revealed that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about the predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned that temperatures would remain in the mid-to-low 80s over the weekend, and this was presented as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nOne story that stood out to me was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, around 6 feet tall, and weighing around 150 pounds. What struck me as unusual was the emphasis on his skin tone and the fact that they repeatedly mentioned he was black. It seemed excessive.\n\nThe final story I watched was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who was sentenced to prison for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio. What caught my attention was the way the news reported his sentence – instead of saying 25 years, they said \"300 months.\" I'm not sure what the reasoning was behind this, but it seemed like they were trying to make the sentence sound harsher. They also mentioned that he was a Hispanic man, but I'm not sure how relevant that was to the story.",
            "A bond between brothers is a unique and powerful thing - unbreakable and irrevocable. This bond encompasses a wide range of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers have a deep understanding of one another, one that goes beyond any other relationship. When staring into the eyes of their brother, they can see their own reflection staring back. It's in the most critical moments that the true nature of this bond is revealed, whether it's good or bad. The consequences that come with these emotions can be far-reaching, and a key part of understanding the complex emotions born of this fraternal link is learning to live with those consequences. When one can gaze into their brother's eyes and see their own true self staring back, they gain a profound insight into their own character. This is evident through the actions they take and the consequences that follow. \n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers embark on a journey that delves into this theme and the intense emotions that come with it. Against a backdrop of a vivid, lush landscape, these two boys set out on a doomed path. The conflict between bitter disappointment and intense pride reaches a boiling point in the climactic scene, leaving only one brother alive. The author illustrates this theme through the direct characterization of the protagonist, as well as the interactions between the two brothers and the narrator's perspective, which conveys the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his perception of the world around him. These influences greatly impact his actions. \n\nThe protagonist's actions can be summed up by one dominant emotion: pride. From the moment he and his younger brother, Doodle, set out together, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had hoped for a brother who could accompany him in all his endeavors, learning from him and sharing in his experiences, like holding his breath, running, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp. He envisioned a brother who could join him on his adventures, like racing to Horsehead Landing and perching with him in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. Unfortunately, these aspirations are impossible, given Doodle's fragile health. Born with a severely weakened heart, it was highly unlikely that Doodle would survive, let alone participate in physically demanding activities. The protagonist's disappointment is palpable as his dreams are crushed in an instant. He even entertains the thought of suffocating Doodle with a pillow, showcasing the depth of his frustration. However, his anger melts away when Doodle smiles at him, revealing a glimmer of hope. This fleeting moment suggests that his conviction was not as strong as he thought. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "In the realm of brain science, a critical topic is the human brain - an intricate, creative information-processing system. Over time, as technology has evolved from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also undergone significant changes. In the past, the brain was likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, a computer. As you delve deeper into the brain, it's essential to remember that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and may lead to misconceptions.\n\nThe process of information processing begins with sensory organs transforming physical stimuli, such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light, into electrochemical signals. This sensory information undergoes repeated transformations through the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing. To illustrate this, consider viewing a picture of a black box on a white background. Bottom-up processing combines basic information like color, orientation, and object borders to recognize the box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, uses the decisions made at earlier steps to speed up your recognition of the box, possibly identifying it as a black box or a box-shaped hole in the background.\n\nWhen information has been processed to some extent, an attention filter determines its importance and decides which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For instance, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name even in a noisy room. There are numerous stages of processing, and the results are repeatedly modulated by attention.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded. Different types of encoding are specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to its visual appearance, phonemically, referring to its sound, or semantically, referring to its meaning. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained through an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on how human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Many critics have argued that Aldous Huxley's novel Brave New World is a scathing critique of the dangers of emerging technologies and the capitalist systems that fuel them. Huxley's dystopian society is a stark contrast to our own, where people prioritize community above individuality and are conditioned from birth to pursue instant gratification. The citizens are little more than pawns in a larger game, trapped in a world where they are forced to conform to a single ideology imposed by the World Controller. When viewed through the lens of Marxist theory, it becomes clear that Huxley's work is a commentary on the darker aspects of the capitalist systems of his time. The novel is riddled with Marxist terminology, such as homogeny and reification, which reinforce the idea that Huxley was warning against the dangers of emerging economic systems. \n\nOne of the primary targets of Huxley's satire is the concept of false consciousness, a key tenet of Marxist theory. In Brave New World, the common citizenry is kept in the dark about the true nature of the economy and their place within it, focused instead on their own personal gain. This is achieved through the use of hypnopædia, which conditions people to prioritize consumption and indulgence above all else. The World Controller manipulates this desire, using hegemony to dominate the lower classes and keep them in line. The lower classes, represented by characters such as the Deltas and Gammas, are unaware of the manipulation, literally \"buying into\" an ideology that supports the status quo. Meanwhile, the upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, are aware of the system but do little to challenge it. The novel's portrayal of relationships between characters, or rather the lack thereof, is also telling. Interactions are shallow and lacking in depth, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism has drained individuals of their free will and emotional expression. Even romantic relationships are reduced to superficial comments about physical appearance, further highlighting the dehumanizing effects of the capitalist system. The complacency of each social class in their place within the hierarchy is a testament to the Marxist concept of the proletariat, who are led to believe they are superior as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform.",
            "As a student at University Park for nearly three years, I've come to realize that navigating the campus can be a hassle. My freshman year, I lived in East Halls, which is essentially the farthest east point on campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Getting from my dorm in Stuart Hall to classes in buildings like Willard, located near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially during bad weather, which is a regular occurrence in State College. I recently spoke to an alum who's not much older than me, and they shared that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated from the rest of the university by large tracts of unused land. However, this empty space has since been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to expand, traveling from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. In my opinion, the most effective solution to this problem is the bicycle. However, it's not just about owning a bike; students need to use them regularly, and the campus needs to be designed with the needs of bicyclists in mind.\n\nOne of my friends recently took up cycling again after a few years of not riding. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped, saying, \"Bikes are great – for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is cycling beneficial for your health, but it's also the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical activity can take you 30 miles or more. As a student living off-campus, I now face similar challenges getting to class. I have to travel to Thomas building, which is just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. Buying a bike was the smartest decision I made this year, as it can cut down on walking time significantly. However, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas, isn't always the easiest road to navigate by bike. While walking has its benefits, I'm too busy to walk, and without my bike, it would be my only reliable option, taking an extra 30-40 minutes each way, which is over two and a half hours per week. This is time I simply can't spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson.

Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",

As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "I'm passionate about pursuing a career in social work, specifically with the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can make a real difference in the lives of children who have been abused or neglected, and support families in need. My values align with the social work field, and I want to uphold the following principles: service, respect, an ethical approach, and a commitment to strengthening relationships and personal growth. These values are not just essential for social workers, but also for me, as a person.\n\nI've always been driven to help others, but I wasn't sure which career path to take. Throughout high school and college, I witnessed people struggling with their problems and some adopting unhealthy coping mechanisms. This inspired me to earn a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Although I still wasn't certain about my career path, I decided to take a break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. That summer, I had a life-changing experience when a friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was escaping his abusive parents. The next day, he contacted the police, and I visited his parents' house to express my concerns. I told the police about my Psychology degree and offered to speak with the parents, as there was nothing the law could do at that point. When I questioned them, they seemed defensive and made excuses for their son's actions. This encounter made me realize the importance of a career in social work, where I can help children and families in similar situations.\n\nAnother crucial value for me in the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim to value individuality, but our actions often suggest that we prioritize conformity. I believe in embracing my uniqueness and not limiting myself to societal expectations. Throughout my high school and college years, I've been an advocate for social justice, expressing myself through my appearance, my involvement with the GSBA, and my efforts to combat racism and discrimination. I plan to continue fighting for social justice in my career as a social worker.",
            "The following paper delves into the relationship between the biological and sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on the genetic and medical aspects of health, while the sociocultural model examines the environmental factors that influence sleep patterns. This paper reviews research related to these models and critiques their strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental health condition, or a sleep disorder resulting from other medical complications. The primary sleep disorders include Dyssonmias and Parasomnias. Dyssonmias encompass a range of sleep disorders, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia involves difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy, on the other hand, is marked by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep.\n\nResearch in the biological model suggests that genes and heritable factors play a significant role in sleep disorders. Studies have shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, which contain orexin, are responsible for regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study involving mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are essential for sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, was found to increase sleep time in mice, implying that genetic and environmental factors contribute to physical GABAB receptors in humans. This has significant implications for understanding the biological basis of insomnia and the potential for treatments that target this receptor.\n\nThe sociocultural model, on the other hand, examines how environmental factors, such as demographics, socioeconomic status, and ethnic background, influence sleep patterns. Research in this area suggests that these factors can have a significant impact on an individual's ability to sleep. For example, studies have shown that individuals from certain ethnic backgrounds are more likely to experience insomnia due to cultural factors, such as dietary habits and sleep environments. Additionally, socioeconomic status can also play a role in sleep patterns, with individuals from lower-income backgrounds experiencing more sleep disturbances.\n\nIn conclusion, the biological and sociocultural models provide complementary perspectives on the disorder insomnia. The biological model highlights the genetic and medical aspects of health, while the sociocultural model examines the environmental factors that influence sleep patterns. By understanding the complex interplay between these factors, researchers and clinicians can develop more effective treatments for insomnia and improve the quality of life for individuals affected by this disorder.",
            "This paper delves into the realm of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), exploring three key areas. Firstly, we'll provide a concise definition of the disorder, illuminating its core aspects. Next, we'll delve into the diagnostic process, highlighting common characteristics or 'red flags' indicative of CAPD. Finally, we'll conclude by discussing practical ways a teacher can support a student with CAPD in a mainstream classroom environment.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) is a complex condition that affects the central nervous system's (CNS) efficiency in processing auditory information. Simply put, it's a disorder where the brain struggles to interpret and separate auditory inputs, making it difficult to distinguish between sounds, conversations, and background noise (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). CAPD is not the same as hearing impairment; rather, it's a neurobiological issue that affects the brain's ability to process auditory information.\n\nThe earliest recorded mention of CAPD dates back to the 1950s, initially referred to as 'auditory imperception' (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers began developing tests to identify children with communicative disorders, and by the 1960s, they had made significant strides in understanding the condition. Notably, the Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari introduced dichotic testing in 1954, and Kimura formulated a model to explain the physiology behind dichotic perception in 1961 (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 further sparked research into CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways, including difficulties with sound localization, sound pattern recognition, speech differentiation, and auditory synthesis. Individuals with CAPD may struggle to filter out background noise, recognize changes in speech, or sequence auditory information (Ferre). They may also experience sound blocking, where one sound is silenced by a subsequent sound.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a systematic assessment of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests, conducted by professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and others (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may involve questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors. Unfortunately, there is no single, universally accepted diagnostic tool, and the exact cause of CAPD remains unknown. Diagnostic tests often present patients with multiple auditory stimuli and ask them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses to these signals.",
            "The play Twelfth Night suggests that while adopting a disguise can be a useful tool for deceiving people, ultimately, it can lead to a person losing themselves in the process if they don't shed that disguise. The challenge with ending a deception, however, is that it can lead to feelings of isolation. Therefore, the decision comes down to whether one prioritizes their own sense of self or their relationships with others. While some people might react neutrally to discovering they've been tricked, others may take offense to the deception and be hurt by it. The topic of deception through gender role reversal raises additional questions, especially the underlying reason behind it. For instance, in Twelfth Night, the character Viola disguises herself as a man to protect herself, as seen in the lines \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249). This decision allows her to find temporary safety but also alienates her from the women around her, depriving her of a vital support system. Furthermore, she becomes so convincing in her disguise that Olivia falls in love with her instead of the real Sebastian, as expressed in \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). Viola also has to contend with unrequited romantic feelings between her and Orsino, as mentioned in \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nTwelfth Night can be seen as an exploration of how deception can reveal suppressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may have unconscious desires that are brought to the surface by Viola/Cesario's disguise. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because of his masculine appearance or does she genuinely harbor feelings for women? It's likely that this is not the case, as Olivia's character seems to be satirizing those who judge people based on their appearance. This is evident from her swift shift in romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian and her subsequent view of Cesario/Viola as a family member rather than a love interest, as expressed in \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "German colonial rule in various territories is often remembered for its brutal nature, particularly its handling of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. However, no single term can fully capture the diverse policies and leadership styles employed by the German colonial empire across its vast geography. The provision of education in the colonies also varied greatly. For instance, when the British took control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a significant number of well-educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) stood in stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the government played a significant role in establishing schools and educating locals, in South West Africa, the responsibility for native education was largely left to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government, however, invested heavily in the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing a system of state schools and heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had lasting effects on South West Africa, even after German rule had ended. While other German colonies had significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, the majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate.\n\nSeveral social, political, and economic factors contributed to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper aims to build on existing research by identifying these factors and focusing on new insights into the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. A substantial body of literature explores education in the German colonial empire, with many sources written in German during or shortly after the period of German rule. Early works primarily aimed to describe the characteristics of educational systems in the colonies, while later English-language writings expanded the discussion through comparative studies and detailed analyses of specific aspects of education.\n\nOne of the most influential studies on the topic is Cohen's research on education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and highlights the factors that account for their differences. According to Cohen, the relatively large settler population in South West Africa played a significant role in shaping the colony's educational system. Compared to Germany's other colonial territories, South West Africa had a relatively mild climate, although much of the territory is arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflects this, with nearly 15,000 whites living in the colony by 1913, compared to just 5,336 in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "Over the past century, the classification of popular music has expanded to include an overwhelming array of genres, making it challenging to list them all definitively. Moreover, most genres – rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and many more – have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres, further complicating the matter. Heavy Metal rock, in particular, has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the last 40 years. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide range of emotions, generally focusing on the darker side of the spectrum. Its diversity arose from the realization that it had real flexibility, which people soon exploited to create their own sub-genres, followed by sub-sub-genres, and the pattern continues to this day.\n\nCurrently, the heavy metal movement has reached a point where it's difficult to determine what exactly heavy metal is, as it has absorbed various themes from other genres. However, like everything else, it originated from somewhere. To grasp the metal music that pervades modern society, one must first understand the metal movement, and why it's a movement rather than just a genre.\n\nIn many ways, metal is a movement defined by darkness. It can be viewed as \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more violence, more theatricality. Unlike other genres, metal bands are known for their impressive technical skills, which shine through in their music. Additionally, metal is heavily influenced by drugs, particularly the psychedelic boom in the mid-70s, which led to the creation of crazy, otherworldly records. The music possesses many dark, visceral qualities, which were a departure from the prevailing popular music scene at the time, which often lacked true representation of the darker side of emotions. Later generations of metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities present in the Romantic Era. Lyricists like those responsible for the song Helter Skelter, for instance, express the darkness that is a staple of the movement. This song, often regarded as one of the first Heavy Metal songs, showcases the edgier side of the Beatles, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier, darker work.",
            "The life and work of Henri Rousseau predated the Surrealist movement, yet his struggles and artistic endeavors mirrored those of his successors. His 1910 painting, The Dream, is a poignant representation of his internal conflict between conforming to traditional styles and embracing his unique artistic voice. This dichotomy was a lifelong struggle for Rousseau, who yearned for recognition and acceptance within the art world. As a painter, he was torn between the desire to fit in and please his critics, and the need to break free from conventional norms and forge his own path.\n\nTo understand the context behind The Dream, it's essential to delve into Rousseau's personal history. Born on May 21, 1844, in the French town of Laval, he was the son of a successful hardware dealer. Despite his humble beginnings, Rousseau's life took a dramatic turn when his first wife, Clémence, passed away, leaving him with only one child, Julia, and a deep sense of loss. He turned to painting as a means of solace and a fresh start, replacing the hardships of his past with a pursuit of artistic expression.\n\nAs a self-taught painter, Rousseau's work was shaped by his experiences as a member of the working class. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized and sentimentalized the peasant class, Rousseau's art reflected the hopes and dreams of ordinary people. His struggles to gain recognition within the art world were compounded by the fact that he began his career at an older age, and was producing works alongside some of the most talented and established artists of the time.\n\nAs author Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, Rousseau's journey was distinct from that of his contemporary, Henri Matisse. While Matisse was driven by a desire to avoid trite painting, Rousseau sought to create works that were conventional enough to warrant acceptance into the prestigious Artiste Français. The Dream, with its dreamlike landscapes and serene subject, is a testament to Rousseau's enduring struggle to reconcile his artistic vision with the expectations of the art world.",
            "Many profound thinkers have pondered the intricate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. In my opinion, there's a fundamental reason behind this connection. John Keats' \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" beautifully captures this idea, stating, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of what we learn in life comes from education or experience, we often appreciate ethics and aesthetics in a way that transcends these conventional channels. As Keats suggests, both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe rather than prescribe, striving to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than providing a set of rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior. \n\nIn essence, criticism of art or morals can never fully grasp the essence of what's good or beautiful. For instance, discussing the worth of the Mona Lisa might center on concepts like composition, context, or symbolism, but ultimately, these factors don't convey why it's considered great art. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more complex explanation. I believe that both art and morals can't be reduced to a simple description of their qualities. Flannery O'Connor's words come to mind: \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" No matter how thoroughly we analyze the properties of a work of literature, there's an intangible quality that remains. This is also true for ethics, as Wittgenstein said, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that this \"something\" – this je ne sais quoi – is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and their transcendental nature provides a common ground between them.\n\nIn my opinion, morality and art are closely related because we experience both at a profound, noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be felt but not fully explained. This connection is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean notes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany is a powerhouse today, a united country with a unique blend of cultures that stretch from the alps in München to the Baltic sea city of Kiel, and from the Rhine river city of Köln to the Saxon city of Dresden on the Elbe. This rich cultural heritage shouldn't be surprising, given the country's diverse origins. Germany's history is a patchwork of different tribes and influences, with its ancestral land being known as Germania.\n\nThe origins of the name \"Germany\" are a topic of debate among historians and scholars. According to the Roman historian Tacitus, it may have come from the Germanic tribe known as the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and clashed with the Gaulish forces. Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, where he battled the Gauls and Germanic tribes who crossed the Rhine under dubious pretenses. Caesar took this term from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the unvanquished Germanic tribes. Some scholars believe the name \"Germany\" came from the Gaulish language, referring to a neighbor or a neighboring tribe.\n\nAlternatively, others propose that the name \"Germany\" is derived from the spear used by the Germanic warriors, known as a \"ger\" in Old English, or from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which suggested the Germans were loud and boisterous. In his book \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98, Tacitus described the Germans as a distinct people, untouched by immigration or intermarriage with other races. He noted that the Romans would not have left their empire to settle in the harsh, unforgiving land of Germania, unless it was their ancestral home.\n\nThe Germanic tribes did indeed live on the fringes of the Roman Empire, trading goods and skills in exchange for Roman favors and military service. As the Roman Empire expanded, the Germanic tribes played a significant role in its borders, with some even serving in the Roman army. The legacy of these early interactions continues to shape Germany's identity today, a testament to the country's rich and complex history.",
            "I stood frozen, my mind a complete blank slate, as I took in the sight before me.  Emotions were nonexistent, my thoughts zipping in and out of my mind faster than I could grasp them.  It was as if I was merely a spectator, observing the scene without any personal connection to it.  The experience was almost surreal, like my consciousness was a liquid, effortlessly flowing from one thought to the next without any real attachment.\n\nI'd purchased an art instruction book, \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" after a suggestion from a fellow artist.  I'd always been fascinated by drawing since I was six years old, and this book promised to teach me the fundamentals of art, from understanding the basics of a pencil to the brain's processes for interpreting lines.  One technique that stuck with me was the idea of placing a square frame around a subject to simplify the image.  This was supposed to transform a complex scene, like a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen, into a more manageable picture.\n\nAs I stared at the bowl in front of me, I couldn't quite wrap my head around this concept.  I was overwhelmed by the sheer detail, and all I could do was stand there in awe.  If I were to attempt to create something artistic, this bowl was the starting point, the beginning of my masterpiece, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand instinctively found the pencil, my muscles tensing and relaxing as I prepared to bring my vision to life.  Water, calm and serene, reflected my inner state.  But instead of creating something beautiful, I found myself staring at the unyielding brown package in the toilet bowl.  My hand smacked the handle again, frustrated by the toilet's stubbornness.  The package refused to budge, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.\n\nClutching a mop, I frownted, staring at the unwanted surprise left for the bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid.  A few more flushes, and I was left with a tranquil moment to myself.  My hand moved towards the wall, gripped the toilet paper sheet, and began to wrap itself, resembling an oven mitt.  Standing up straight, I bent at the waist, and my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, like a mother inserting a turkey into the oven for Thanksgiving dinner.",
            "In recent years, the alarming number of teenagers dying behind the wheel has raised serious concerns about the safety of our youngest drivers. The stats are alarming, and several factors contribute to this deadly trend. The National Institutes of Health point out that one crucial aspect is that the teen brain is not fully equipped to handle the dangers of driving. Simple inexperience also plays a significant role, causing a higher rate of fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nIt's no surprise that teens fare worse when driving with their peers, which is often the case. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study showing a clear correlation between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents. This is a disturbing reality that California and other states have attempted to address by introducing temporary provisional licenses that limit driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\nHowever, I believe that provisional driver's licenses are mere temporary solutions. The root issue is that, as a group, the youngest drivers are not capable of handling the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman has found that even at 18, the age of many new drivers, the tendency to take risks for the thrill of it is still prevalent. This is evident in Zuckerman's research, which suggests that most young people under 19-20 years old have a strong desire to take risks. It's logical, then, to delay driving until this urge to take risks has begun to decrease. If we continue to issue driver's licenses to young teens, we can expect the death toll to rise dramatically in the coming years. By 2010, millions of new teen drivers will be hitting the roads, and the consequences will be dire.\n\nImplementing legislation to address this issue would be relatively straightforward. Schools could continue to provide driver's education classes to begin the learning process, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle. A provisional permit could still be issued before granting a full driver's license, and a set number of practical driver's training hours would still be required. This number could be based on the current hours required by most states (for example, California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Uniform, national legislation would be a reasonable and effective way to protect teens across the nation.\n\nThis proposal is not a new idea, but it's one that deserves serious consideration. By taking a proactive approach, we can save countless lives and reduce the number of teen driving fatalities.",
            "I was browsing through the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, and I decided to check out their trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were a total of 15 films that showcased the creative use of editing to create illusions. My film analysis focused on analyzing the techniques behind these trick films and identifying the unique characteristics that emerged in a few of the later ones. Most trick films from this era are set-bound, shot from a fixed position within a frontal proscenium, and feature long and medium shots, sticking to the traditional one shot per film approach. However, some early 20th-century films dared to break these rules by introducing new elements such as multiple shots.\n\nOne common thread among these trick films is their use of interior sets within a frontal proscenium frame. The camera remains stationary, never moving to follow characters or objects within the scene. This style of composition drew inspiration from theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. This approach, however, has its limitations, as characters in these films typically only move side-to-side and do not walk towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right side and move back and forth horizontally, while the camera remains stationary.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also resulted in predominantly long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-up shots were never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This is reminiscent of the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in early films, actors rarely move towards the camera, making close-ups a rare occurrence.\n\nMost early trick films followed the rule of one conceptual shot per film, limiting their length to about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This approach also restricted the narrative or dramatic use of these films, with most focusing on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic and disappearing acts with little story. However, a closer look at the individual shots reveals that a single \"shot\" can be composed of multiple physical shots, joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895).",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a passionate advocate for Republicanism, and his profession as an agriculturalist played a significant role in shaping his views on personal freedom and government. As a result, his opinions on governance were deeply rooted in his dedication to the agrarian way of life. His primary goal was to preserve and promote this system, which he believed was the foundation for all his arguments on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system.\n\nIn Taylor's opinion, the United States had a rare opportunity to create an ideal system of government, unencumbered by pre-existing traditions. This enabled the establishment of a self-governing system that respected the natural rights of individuals. He firmly believed that these rights were intertwined and that denying one right would diminish the value of the others. Therefore, he argued that the government should not interfere with these fundamental rights. Taylor also believed that in the \"state of nature,\" individuals with physical strength and malicious intentions often held power, but that this should not be the case in a civilized society.\n\nTo create an ideal society, Taylor believed that the government must acknowledge the dual nature of humanity, with both good and evil present within individuals. He adhered rigidly to a dualistic morality, stating that government, as exercised by humans, would inevitably reflect the virtues and vices of its leaders. He defined good principles as protecting private property, promoting agriculture, and discouraging excessive capitalism. In his view, a government founded on these principles would function fairly, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be driven by self-interest and avarice. Taylor believed that self-interest was a fundamental human motivation, but that it becomes problematic when it leads to the exploitation of others. A good government was essential to contain man's natural evil and to prevent the introduction of bad principles.\n\nLike many other Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, limiting the federal government to the powers explicitly granted to it. He recognized that an extensive federal government would be expensive and potentially tyrannical. However, he also believed that a simplistic, literal interpretation of the Constitution could be misleading and corrupt without reference to the intent of its authors. Furthermore, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence to be the true charter of the United States, as it more explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Looking back at our data in Figure 17, it's clear that there was a significant drop in commuter log submissions during the third month of our project. This was a bit concerning, and it's difficult to pinpoint the exact reason behind it. As winter started to set in at our New England campus, there was a noticeable decrease in people commuting by bike or on foot, which could account for some of the decline. The end of the fall semester in December also meant that everyone was busy with schoolwork, and filling out the commuter log might have slipped their minds. Additionally, the start of the holiday season and the subsequent month-long break for students and faculty likely contributed to the low number of submissions. With classes resuming in late January, it's not surprising that log submissions remained low at that time. However, the low numbers in February were particularly puzzling, and we struggled to explain them. One possible explanation is that projects like ours tend to have an initial burst of energy and enthusiasm, which can wane over time. To combat this, we launched the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a special campaign aimed at reinvigorating the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions. Nevertheless, it was clear that we faced two main challenges: the natural decrease in engagement during breaks, and the cultural preference for driving cars, which is deeply ingrained in our society. To overcome this, we offered various incentives, including gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, and other businesses. It would have been interesting to see how larger prizes, like a new bike or a hybrid car, might have affected participation. Perhaps if we had increased the value of the prizes over time, we could have maintained a higher level of engagement, especially during the low periods like December and January.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a type of security that allows you to track an index, a commodity, or a basket of assets like an index fund, but combines the benefits of an index fund with the flexibility of a stock. Imagine having the diversification of an index fund and the ability to sell short, buy on margin, or purchase as few as one share in a single transaction - it's a pretty attractive combination. What's more, the expense ratios of ETFs are significantly lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, there are some downsides to consider, such as the commission fees associated with trading ETFs. On the other hand, the variety of funds available is quite impressive.\n\nIn this article, we'll be taking a closer look at the ETF IHF and examining its top 10 holdings to see whether the benefits of owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the individual stocks. We'll also investigate whether there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return. To keep things manageable, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets.\n\nTo gauge how well these 10 stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we'll use a simple calculation to estimate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings. The results are revealing: a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF's overall Beta, suggesting that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower risk.\n\nHowever, it's essential to determine whether these differences are statistically significant. To do this, we'll calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalize them to 100%, and compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF. The results will help us conclude whether a portfolio of the top 10 holdings is indeed a viable alternative to the ETF.",
            "In my opinion, \"Dream-Land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's most impressive poems. This poem showcases Poe's creativity and mastery of language. In \"Dream-Land,\" Poe uses the term \"Thulé\" twice, which is a testament to his broad literary influences. It's no secret that Poe was familiar with the works of German authors, particularly Goethe. In fact, Poe's use of the term Thulé is often attributed to Goethe's poem \"The King of Thulé.\" \n\nA close reading of \"Dream-Land\" reveals that Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing is more than just coincidental. Karl J. Arndt's book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\" highlights the similarities between the two poems, suggesting that Poe was, in fact, drawing inspiration from Goethe's work. \n\nGoethe was a celebrated writer, best known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts in 1808 and 1832, the year of his death. Within the second part of Faust lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who is consumed by grief after his wife's death. The poem's themes of loss and sorrow are eerily similar to those found in \"Dream-Land,\" where the speaker describes a dark and lonely landscape haunted by the ghosts of dead friends.\n\nThe similarities between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" are striking, and it's possible to read them as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a world without color, where he is haunted by the memories of his dead friends. This is reminiscent of Goethe's poem, where the King of Thulé is consumed by his loss and is forced to confront the reality of his own mortality.\n\nPoe's familiarity with Goethe's work is further evidenced by his reference to Thulé in his other writings, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" It's clear that Poe was deeply influenced by Goethe's poetry, and his use of the term Thulé in \"Dream-Land\" is a testament to his admiration for the German author.\n\nIn fact, Poe's respect for Goethe was not limited to his poetry. He was also a great admirer of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and would have likely been exposed to Goethe's work through various reproductions and translations that were widely available during his time. This suggests that Poe's use of Thulé in \"Dream-Land\" is not only a nod to Goethe's influence but also a reflection of his broader literary interests and influences.",
            "California law makes it possible for a customer who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill in a grocery store to receive punitive damages if the store manager acted with malice. In this case, Jennifer Palmer was injured after slipping on the spill, and her claim for punitive damages may not be summarily dismissed by a judge. To qualify for punitive damages, Palmer must show that the store manager, Paul Martin, acted with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from his actions, as well as demonstrating that his conduct was despicable. Palmer can argue that Martin knew about the probable harm of not cleaning the spill because there had been multiple slip-and-fall incidents in the store in the months leading up to her accident, and he still chose to ignore the issue. While it's debatable whether Martin's actions were truly despicable, Palmer's argument is still reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents that occurred in 2009 and Martin's failure to take adequate measures to ensure the store's safety. \n\nThe relevant events began on October 13, 2009, when Rich Wayne, a D&D Markets employee, informed Martin about the applesauce spill. Martin responded that he was on a dinner break and couldn't deal with customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin of the spill, but he gave the same response. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim. \n\nCalifornia law allows punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud, or malice.” California Civil Code Section 3294(a) (Lexis 2010) defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff's rights when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.

            "I still recall a course I took in Islam at CBC almost four years ago that left a lasting impression on me.  One topic of heated debate in that class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  In my opinion, this question remains more pertinent today than ever before.  Reflecting on the events following 9/11, I've noticed mass media shift from a negative image of Islam and extremism to an excessive display of tolerance for Islam in America.  It's hard to imagine that in 2001 a presidential candidate with an obvious Islamic background, such as Barack Obama, could have been a viable candidate.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet has always fascinated me, particularly given the apparent contradiction between the historical Muhammad and the personality portrayed in the biography.  I had previously learned that Muhammad allegedly forced conversions to Islam, conquering and taking over tribes before forcing them to adopt his faith.  However, the biography presents Muhammad as a humble and self-effacing figure who was misunderstood and humble in the face of adversity.  According to the text, people gradually came to see the truth in his teachings and sought him out one by one.\n\nI've also noticed striking similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' of Muhammad.  One notable example is when he reportedly multiplied mutton and milk, providing more than enough for forty men.  The style of writing used in this account makes me suspect that the authors aimed to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet who didn't need to prove anything, but simply lived a life of truth and miracles.  This kind of flawed narrative downplays the miracle and significance of Jesus Christ's life, much like they're trying to take credit for his personhood and life through Muhammad.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous stories that seem to be part of their agenda to provide evidence of 'witnesses' or how people 'on their own' converted to Islam.  However, many of these stories are presented from a third-party perspective, often several layers removed, which undermines their credibility.  While the authors' intention was to provide proof of the truth of these stories, it only serves to make them seem more suspicious.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the attempt to elevate and glorify Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  However, history contradicts the notion that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can't help but wonder if Muslims today are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "Looking back at the teachings of Jesus, it's clear that they were left behind as Christianity continued to evolve after his time.  If we take a broad look at Christian history, it appears that the faith has been moving further and further away from its roots.  Nowadays, the world has become more aware and progressive, and it seems that people are starting to crave a return to the original intent of the religion.  While traditionalists will resist any change, they may not have enough influence to shape the entire movement.  As time goes on, I believe we'll see a growing awareness among Christians of the differences between the original teachings of Jesus and the doctrines that were added over time.  This awareness will eventually lead to a major shift in Christian history, with a movement emerging to strip away the layers of doctrine that have been built up over the centuries.  It may take a while, but the result will be inevitable: we'll see a return to the core teachings of Jesus, unadulterated by later interpretations.  When this movement takes hold in the US and Europe, it will lead to a more uniformity of belief and practice, with people coming together to follow the original ideas of Jesus.  The church as an institution will remain strong, but its teachings will be simplified, and diversity within Christianity will give way to greater similarity.  History is full of examples of great reversals, such as the way that Christianity went from being persecuted to becoming a dominant force in the Roman Empire, or the way that the US moved from slavery to leadership by African Americans.  The next great reversion in Christian history will be a return to the source, undoing the complexities of centuries of tradition and doctrine in favor of a more straightforward understanding of Jesus' teachings.  A key part of this process will be seeing Jesus' words as metaphors rather than literal statements.  So, where did things go wrong since Jesus' time?\n\nLooking back into history, we can see that the foundation of Christianity was actually Judaism, with its monotheistic theology and authoritative Hebrew scriptures.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish population was already divided into various groups, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people.  The seeds of division and complexity were already sown, and it's clear that Jesus' teachings were just the beginning of a long and winding road.",
            "In my opinion, The Jungle is a powerful portrayal of human nature, revealing that deep down, people are inherently self-centered and focused solely on personal gain. This is evident in the way the novel's characters behave, particularly the wealthy factory owners and managers. Their primary goal is to expand their businesses and amass wealth, regardless of the consequences for others. The text describes the devastating impact of their actions, like the pollution caused by the factories, with Upton Sinclair's vivid description of the \"great chimneys\" and \"river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This emphasizes the owners' complete disregard for the well-being of their employees and the environment.\n\nThe employees, on the other hand, are treated poorly, forced to work long hours with little compensation or protection. The owners' primary concern is saving money, as seen in the quote, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" During that era, there were few regulations to safeguard workers' rights, allowing the owners to exploit them mercilessly. The workers were expected to endure the harsh conditions, both in the factories and their living environments, with no support or resources available to help them. The novel likens them to slaves, highlighting the inevitability and prevalence of immorality in such a system.\n\nOverall, The Jungle is a thought-provoking commentary on the darker aspects of human nature and the consequences of unchecked greed and exploitation.",
            "Many authors use various techniques to influence their readers' perceptions and attitudes towards certain subjects. One particularly effective technique is the pairing of adjectives and nouns that don't usually go together, creating a distinct aura around the subject. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully employs this technique in his novel The Great Gatsby. He often applies meaning to symbols and then uses them to convey a specific emotion or feeling. One notable example is his use of colors like white, gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald builds up the significance of white and gray, then cleverly uses it to evoke a particular feeling in the reader.\n\nFitzgerald establishes the meaning of white and gray as uniformity, with white representing a slightly higher and more refined class, and gray representing a more aged and faded quality. He introduces this meaning at the beginning of the novel by repeatedly using both colors. Characters like Daisy and Jordan are often described as wearing white, creating an image of uniformity. In fact, the only time characters are not wearing white is when Nick is describing Gatsby's party, which is depicted as \"gaudy with primary colors.\" Fitzgerald further reinforces this meaning by associating these colors with ordinary, unremarkable subjects, such as a \"white chasm of lower New York\" and \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable.\n\nAfter establishing the significance of white and gray, Fitzgerald uses them to convey a sense of unimportance or uniformity. This technique is first applied to Daisy, who, after a period of relative absence, is reintroduced as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster.\" This portrayal makes Daisy seem less like a fully fleshed-out character and more like a uniform, something that Gatsby desires and longs for. Fitzgerald employs this technique repeatedly to reinforce this impression of Daisy as a uniform, using descriptions like a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's encounter.",
            "San Diego County is renowned for its exceptional agricultural productivity, primarily due to its mild and sunny climate. The region is ideal for cultivating a wide variety of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial in the San Diego area, with many local organizations boasting lengthy waiting lists for organic produce. Organic eggs and milk are also extremely popular among the local community. Many organic farms in the area offer guided tours of their agricultural operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other outdoor activities. This type of operation allows landowners to reap the benefits of government programs while maintaining an environmentally friendly approach that enhances the local wildlife and habitat, thus providing opportunities for recreational activities and educational programs.\n\nIn addition to catering to a lucrative niche market, organic farming offers several benefits, including increased biodiversity in plants and wildlife due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming often comes with higher costs compared to conventional methods, including more intensive labor and management to control pests and weeds, as well as fertilize the soil without using chemicals. Organic farms may also experience greater losses and lack the efficiency of scale that large conventional operations enjoy. Furthermore, practices beneficial to wildlife that are unrelated to organic farming, such as planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to create specific conditions like edge habitat or patches of open ground, may incur additional labor costs.\n\nThe scenario presented involves a 160-acre parcel located adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California. This property is characterized by a mix of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. The East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan covers this area, which is currently under review. The plan considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher. Others are declining and may soon be listed, including burrowing owls.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production for many years.\n\nTo create a realistic model for a small farmer, I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs that could help mitigate costs and preserve wildlife-friendly operations. I chose an organic farm in the same area as a model for what someone farming this land might aim to achieve.",
            "Understanding culture plays a significant role in any negotiation, and it's essential to approach it with a nuanced perspective. A culture can be defined by what it is not, as much as what it is, and what it signifies. It's essential to avoid making broad generalizations about a culture, such as labeling all Russians as stubborn or Japanese as accommodating. Instead, it's more productive to understand the significance of a culture to the specific negotiation at hand and how it can impact the table talks. When dealing with a foreign culture, one is naturally inclined to compare it to their own, which can lead to misunderstandings. \n\nTo navigate a foreign culture, one must be willing to learn its history, realize its biases, and be open to its perspectives. Rather than trying to change or judge a culture, it's crucial to accept it for what it is and work within its boundaries, especially when negotiating from a weaker position. When on foreign soil, showing respect for local traditions and customs can help overcome cultural barriers and facilitate the negotiation process. \n\nIt's also essential to recognize that culture is not limited to national or international boundaries. Companies within a single nation can have their own unique corporate culture, which can be seen in their dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. For instance, some companies value long work hours, while others prioritize a more relaxed schedule. This diversity can be seen within a single societal culture, and it's crucial to understand these differences before entering a negotiation. Even within a seemingly uniform culture, there may be underlying differences that require attention. \n\nUnderstanding values is equally important, as they provide the underlying reasons behind a culture's actions. If saving face or communal harmony are valued in a culture, a negotiator will not publicly embarrass themselves or their superiors to achieve a deal. On the other hand, a negotiator from a culture that values a hard-driven bargain will not settle for less. By considering these generalities before the negotiation, one can tailor their approach to be more effective. Moreover, learning about one's opponent on a personal level can also contribute to a successful negotiation.",
            "The phrase \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God'\" originates from Psalm 14 of the Bible and serves as the foundation for St. Anselm's argument in favor of God's existence. This notion is also echoed in the writings of Thomas Aquinas, who attempts to prove the existence of a higher power. Given that both authors defend the same concept of God, we'll assume they're both correct in their beliefs for the sake of this comparison. To ensure a fair comparison, let's consider a God in line with the one described in the Bible. \n\nWhile both authors present valid points, I believe that neither provides a comprehensive foundation for faith in God. To illustrate this, let's examine the core of St. Anselm's argument first. Anselm's concept revolves around the idea that understanding and knowing God exists within one's own mind. He posits that because God's existence is inherent in our understanding, we can't truly conceive of his nonexistence. Although his explanation can be convoluted and sometimes confusing, the essence of his argument is that the proof for God lies within one's own consciousness. According to Anselm, there's no need to look beyond our own inner selves to find truth about God, as the existence of this being is self-evident. This idea is often referred to as faith within Christian texts, which accepts the truth without empirical evidence. \n\nOn the other hand, St. Thomas Aquinas suggests that the existence of God can be proven solely through reason and evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This concept would be beneficial in evangelism, as it would allow for the recruitment of new believers without relying on their willingness to accept the unproven. Aquinas presents five logical arguments – change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – to demonstrate the necessity of God's existence. He argues that if you know you're missing a puzzle piece, you can deduce the features and existence of that piece simply by assembling the rest of the puzzle, even if you can't see it.",
            "In the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince destined for greatness was born, who would eventually become known as Buddha. As he navigated life, he rejected worldly pursuits and achieved enlightenment, paving the way for the development of Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional branch. The faith is over 2,500 years old and has undergone significant transformations since its inception. This evolution is evident in various aspects, such as the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated, a tradition that doesn't have its roots in Buddha's teachings. These changes span from superficial customs to the core of the religion's philosophies. The Theravada Buddhist community, encompassing both monastics and laypeople, has had to adapt its doctrine over time due to both internal and external influences, some hostile and others benevolent.\n\nTo better understand this topic, let's first establish some essential terms that will be used frequently. We'll refer to internal forces as those generated within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, and external forces as those originating from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are defined as influences that harm or intend to harm the community, often stemming from a negative perception of Buddhism. On the other hand, benevolent forces are those that don't aim to harm or help the community, but may inadvertently do one or the other. These terms will be crucial in our discussion.\n\nTo delve into the heart of Theravada Buddhism, let's examine its fundamental principles. Buddhists seek refuge in the three gems: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma consists of the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for monks and laypeople, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka provides the metaphysical foundation of Buddhism. Key concepts include Anatta (the absence of a soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of everything). Recognizing these ideas is essential to breaking the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara, which ceaselessly recurs. Ultimately, becoming enlightened means overcoming lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka outlines the rules for laypeople, including the five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in immoral conduct, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances). Monks have even more stringent disciplinary rules to follow. At the heart of Buddhism lies the concept of the four noble truths: Dukkha, the reality of suffering; that attachment causes suffering; and that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico are a prime example of two nations that were once plagued by a longstanding rivalry that lasted for a remarkable 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. This tense relationship reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, when the US successfully invaded and defeated Mexico, gaining control of Texas and the American Southwest. While this was the most significant conflict, there were many other clashes between the two nations that finally subsided just before World War I. \n\nThis rivalry was sparked by fundamental differences between the two countries, including conflicting values, customs, and interests. It's a pattern that can be seen in many other nations that share a border, where rivalries often emerge due to competing interests. The US and Mexico are not alone in this regard; other neighboring countries with similar dynamics include Mexico and Cuba, as David M. Pletcher pointed out in 1977. These nations are geographically close to the US and have historically been at odds with it, whereas other Latin American nations have enjoyed relatively good relations with the US.\n\nOne major factor that contributed to the US-Mexico rivalry was a clash of ideologies, specifically a difference in religious values. As Sally Frahm noted in 2001, the US historically opposed Catholicism and monarchies, much like how it later opposed communism and fascism. This ideological divide was rooted in the distrust between the English and Spanish, which was inherited by their respective colonies, the US and Mexico. This inherited distrust made it challenging for the two nations to establish a harmonious relationship.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), there were 17 significant disputes between the US and Mexico during their 57-year rivalry. Most of these disagreements revolved around territorial issues, including border raids and other frontier problems. The US and Mexico eventually exerted military force to address these issues and bring stability to their shared border.\n\nAs Schmitt (1974) pointed out, the rivalry began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the US and the US shifted its focus from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico. This shift marked a turning point in the US-Mexico relationship, ultimately leading to the end of their longstanding rivalry.",
            "It's been 15 years since an unexpected illness took away my ability to work as a nurse, a career I chose to ensure a stable life after a tough childhood. My parents always told me, \"You'll always be able to find a job because people will always get sick,\" a mantra that led me to prioritize nursing over my passions for science and journalism. However, my life took a drastic turn when I turned 46 and was left with no savings and unable to work. To this day, I'm still receiving disability benefits, and after 15 years, I'm left with nothing to call my own. Every day is a struggle to maintain my security, safety, and self-esteem. Despite this, I've come to realize that I couldn't have managed without the unwavering support of my family and close friends. When adversity strikes, we're not as strong as we think we are. \n\nMy point is that life is full of unexpected emergencies, big and small. No matter how prepared we are, some challenges are too great to overcome alone. I agree that we should rely less on the government, but I believe it's more crucial to learn to trust and help one another, rather than building our own isolated shelters. The idea of rugged individualism that American conservatives promote isn't accurate. Our ancestors' success during hard times was due to compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources, not self-reliance. The pioneers who crossed the country in wagon trains didn't make it alone; they relied on each other's help.\n\nBy all means, be prepared. I have my own disaster kit, first aid supplies, and other essentials. If you have the means, consider a small farm or a wood stove. However, while being prepared is essential, it's equally important to know your neighbors and build a support network.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in the way they do is a complex one, and there are many possible factors that can influence the direction of evolutionary change. In fact, despite the advances made by scientists like D'Arcy Thompson, who in 1917 noted that even the simplest organic forms are difficult to define mathematically, we are still far from fully understanding the mechanisms behind evolutionary development.\n\nIn recent years, however, mathematical modeling has begun to play a significant role in our understanding of evolutionary processes. For example, researchers have used mathematical modeling to study the development and evolution of mollusk skeletons, taking into account both the growth of individual organisms (ontogeny) and the evolution of entire species over time (phylogeny). Our own research is focused on applying these techniques to the genus Prunum, and exploring how mathematical modeling can be used in combination with experimental studies to shed light on the mechanisms driving evolutionary change.\n\nTo do this, we used X-ray images of Prunum species to identify key parameters that can be used to model different shell morphologies. These parameters were then entered into a software program called CerioShell, which allowed us to create hypothetical shell shapes and interpret the boundaries of possible change in Prunum. By combining these results with experimental and descriptive studies, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the evolutionary history of this group of organisms.\n\nWhen we think about a shell, we can visualize it as a tube that grows over time, rotating through 360 degrees of space. This rotation creates whorls, which are essentially spiral patterns that surround an imaginary central axis called the columella. The speed at which these whorls grow can vary, and a continuous line divides each whorl, known as a suture. In most shells, the last whorl is the largest, while the spire refers to all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the base is the opposite end, with the animal emerging through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from different angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The most common view is apertural, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count the whorls on a shell, we start by viewing it from the apical perspective and identifying where the first suture begins. We then draw a line to divide the shell into two parts, and count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can also be seen as a series of apertures that move through time and space as the animal grows its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture, we can use coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, to create a mathematical representation of the shell's growth. This allows us to modify the parameters and alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis, gaining insights into the mechanisms driving evolutionary change.",
            "The trend of neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia has remained stagnant over the past decade.  Despite the country being on course to achieve several Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, its progress in child and maternal health lags behind, falling short of the target goals by 2015.  Various factors contributing to these shortcomings will be discussed below, emphasizing the need to strengthen the overall health system rather than focusing solely on programmatic interventions.\n\nOne area where Indonesia has shown improvement is in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this target.  However, this statistic includes traditional workers like midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complicated pregnancies, leading to a significant number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage.  Consequently, the progress made in this area is somewhat misleading, and more work is needed.  Furthermore, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five being treated by a healthcare professional.  Unfortunately, data on postnatal care is incomplete, revealing a pressing concern, with low rates across the country.\n\nCesarian-section rates remain lower than expected, around 4%.  These rates also highlight another issue - the disparity in access to healthcare services across the country.  While c-section rates are 7% in urban areas, they are only 2% in rural areas, underscoring the problem of unequal coverage.  Access to healthcare services is heavily concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural communities underserved.  The issue of vertical equity is also concerning, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the poor struggle to access healthcare due to high out-of-pocket costs.\n\nWhen considering next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, the primary question is how to effectively address the lack of services.  Should Indonesia adopt program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall health system without focusing solely on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children?  While programmatic approaches may seem attractive, as they have targeted, manageable objectives and generate rapid results, there are also drawbacks to consider.  One major concern is that investing heavily in a single area can divert funding and resources away from other critical health sectors, leading to duplication of services, uncoordinated between programs, and increased administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian novels are renowned for their meticulous attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the time period.  However, two novels that diverge from this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  These works incorporate elements of mystery and an air of the bizarre, traits that depart from the conventions of the period.  This unconventional approach adds depth to the characters within each novel, providing insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist navigates his tumultuous world, his mind becomes cluttered with a multitude of confusing and bewildering ideas.  He finds himself caught in a cycle of flashbacks, reliving scenes from his past.  The memory of the shooting that nearly took his life is particularly distressing, as it still lingers vividly in his mind.  This event has a profound impact on Oliver, leaving him feeling overwhelmed and powerless.  The shooting serves as a turning point in his life, as it forces him to confront the harsh realities of his world and the cruelty that surrounds him.  In this moment, Oliver is reminded of the lack of control he has over his circumstances, and the dire situation he finds himself in.\n\nWuthering Heights, on the other hand, employs a different approach to convey the mysterious and the bizarre.  The novel's author masterfully weaves together a complex tapestry of emotions and events, leaving the reader with a sense of unease and uncertainty.  The novel's dreamlike sequences add to the sense of mystery, allowing the reader to glimpse the inner workings of the characters' minds.\n\nIn both novels, the use of dream sequences and hallucinations serves as a means of conveying the characters' inner turmoil and emotional struggles.  These unconventional narrative devices allow the reader to gain a deeper understanding of the characters' motivations and emotions, and provide a unique insight into their inner worlds.  Through these dreamlike states, the novels create a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty, mirroring the characters' own sense of confusion and disorientation.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, the author uses the shooting to highlight Oliver's lack of control over his circumstances.  The event serves as a catalyst for his growing sense of despair and hopelessness.  As Oliver struggles to come to terms with his situation, he is forced to confront the harsh realities of his world.  The shooting is a turning point in his life, marking a shift from a sense of innocence and naivety to one of cynicism and disillusionment.\n\nIn Wuthering Heights, the use of dreamlike sequences serves to create a sense of foreboding and unease.  The novel's author masterfully manipulates the reader's emotions, leaving them with a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity.  The novel's complex characters and events are woven together to create a sense of mystery and intrigue, keeping the reader engaged and invested in the story.\n\nIn conclusion, Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights are two novels that deviate from the conventions of the Victorian period.  Through their use of mystery and the bizarre, these novels create a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty, mirroring the characters' own sense of confusion and disorientation.  The dreamlike sequences and hallucinations in these novels serve as a means of conveying the characters' inner turmoil and emotional struggles, providing a unique insight into their inner worlds.",
            "A couple of years ago, I worked in an after-school program where I tutored elementary-age students, focusing on English and reading, as that's where I felt I could make the most impact. One student in particular, a young boy named Adrian, really caught my attention. He was struggling with reading, but what caught me off guard was the way he pronounced certain letters perfectly while others were completely off. It was baffling. Given that he was of Latino descent, I assumed he was bilingual, but he spoke perfect English. It wasn't until I met his mother, who only spoke Spanish, that the puzzle pieces fell into place: Adrian could read just fine, he just didn't know the English alphabet well. It was a simple yet profound realization, and I hope he's made significant progress since then.\n\nI share this story to highlight the language barrier issue in schools, especially in California. It's not always as straightforward as it seems, even for kids who speak perfect English. Reading can still be a major obstacle. We all acknowledge this problem, so what's the solution? In Adrian's case, one-on-one tutoring in English reading was the answer. However, for children who barely speak English, it's more complex. There's no single solution; it involves combining multiple approaches. \n\nThe dual language system, for instance, is a great idea that benefits not just bilingual children but all students. Research shows that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Many people worry about the costs and that the majority won't benefit, but that's not true. If we implemented these programs as the norm, rather than the exception, all students would benefit. But how do we make it work? Do we require all teachers to be bilingual? That's unrealistic. Instead, we could have bilingual aids, tutors, or assistants to support students.",
            "As we grow up, we're often told that there's something greater than us, something beyond our comprehension. Some of us are taught about it in Sunday school, while others explore it in their own ways. Many of us stick with the faith our parents instilled in us, but some reject it altogether, convinced that our personal universe is all we need. We may start with one set of beliefs and later switch to another, searching for our own path to spirituality. We're on a journey to define ourselves through our unique perspectives on the unknown.\n\nI'll always remember the conversation I had with my dad about his favorite bird - the cardinal. We were sitting on our front porch, listening to the rain fall on the tin roof, and watching the plants along the edge of the porch get drenched. My dad was staring out into the rain, a look that was half contemplative, half nostalgic. He'd lost weight and his hair was thinning, but he didn't make eye contact with me. I felt a mix of emotions - loneliness, fear, and a sense of being unable to talk to him about how much I'd miss him. Instead, I hugged him and we sat there in silence, gazing out into the rain.\n\nMy dad passed away in December, just five days after my 22nd birthday. The chemo and radiation had prolonged his suffering, but it was a hollow victory. I couldn't help but wonder what kind of higher power would allow this to happen. I didn't pray or seek solace in my faith. If God existed, I thought, he'd stopped listening to me a long time ago.\n\nI chose not to watch my dad's passing, preferring to remember him as he lived, not as he died. I knew my dad better than anyone, and I knew he wouldn't have wanted me to witness his final moments. I curled up in bed for three days, waiting for the news. And when it came, it felt like a punch to the gut.\n\nNo one even bothered to call me. It was as if I was invisible.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is an oxymoron, representing the paradoxical fusion of old and new elements, as Ian Watt so astutely pointed out in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This genre has been both praised and criticized, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others admiring its dark, sublime qualities. The original Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew upon both ancient and modern romance to create this new literary style. Walpole cleverly combined old theatrical elements with modern novelistic techniques to craft a unique narrative, which he dubbed \"A Gothic Story.\" This blending of old and new allowed the Gothic genre to stand the test of time, becoming both outdated and fresh to readers separated from its original context by time.\n\nThe Gothic genre is characterized by its references to medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term \"Gothic\" was associated with various people, styles, and eras, often conveying a sense of archaism or unsophistication. However, the fusion of theatrical and modern elements enabled the Gothic genre to endure and evolve, maintaining its relevance despite being rooted in a bygone era.\n\nOne of the key concepts in Gothic literature is the ideal of chivalry, which was both preserved and transformed in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry, the medieval code of conduct for knights, represented the epitome of honor, bravery, and competence. Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, sought to recapture this lost ideal in their work, using it as a commentary on the perceived decline of societal values. Through the portrayal of chivalric characters and manners, the Gothic past was romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the future development of the Romantic movement. In The Castle of Otranto, Walpole's character Frederic embodies many chivalric traits, including his princely status, suffering, and supposed bravery in the face of tragedy. This exaggerated depiction of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" introduces the Gothic trope of excess, setting the stage for the genre's characteristic dramatic flair.",
            "The supply chain management process is a complex web of activities that transform raw materials into finished goods and deliver them to customers.  This concept was first coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described the end-to-end process of planning, executing, and controlling supply chain activities to meet customer demands efficiently. Supply chain management has six key components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Effective managers of supply chains leverage these components to deliver exceptional customer service. \n\nThe production stage is the foundation of the supply chain process. It determines when, why, where, and how products will be produced, and serves as the backbone of the entire operation. To inform production decisions, managers must understand customer needs, which can be gauged by analyzing market trends and customer demands. Once managers grasp customer requirements, they can decide what products to produce, in what quantities, and where production should take place, always keeping in mind the need to meet customer expectations. Efficient production planning is crucial, as even minor oversights can lead to costly delays and inefficiencies in the long run. Companies like Wal-Mart and Target have developed detailed checklists and processes for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments from trucks, ensuring smooth execution and avoiding confusion.\n\nSupply is the second critical element in supply chain management. It involves strategic decisions about a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. A company may have multiple divisions for a single product, each with its unique equipment, workforce, and specialties. Managers must determine which divisions are best suited for each task and may choose to outsource certain processes to other companies to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver high-quality products while maintaining low costs or reducing costs altogether. By outsourcing, companies can streamline their operations, increase efficiency, and boost customer satisfaction.",
            "Standing on a street corner, Ellen Page, star of Juno, holds a cardboard sign aloft with a haunting message scribbled on it: \"Hitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\" This stark statement echoes the tumultuous past and present of Burma, a Southeast Asian country ruled by a ruthless military junta that seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007, a series of protests erupted, marking the first public demonstrations in a decade. Led by Burmese monks wearing traditional saffron robes, these protests became known as the \"Saffron Revolution.\" Initially, the government allowed the monks to gather peacefully, but the situation soon escalated into a brutal crackdown, with the military invading and ransacking monasteries nationwide. Foreign journalists were arrested and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was killed on September 27, 2007, simply for witnessing a street protest. Officially, 13 people were killed, but Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army, claims that the actual death toll was in the thousands.\n\nThis is just one example of a long history of governments attempting to quash dissent and maintain control over their citizens. From ancient Roman emperors declaring themselves divine rulers to the Japanese emperors being believed to be gods, the desire for absolute power has been a staple of human civilization. Even in modern times, leaders like George W. Bush have been known to hold secret meetings with influential figures, blurring the lines between public and private interests.\n\nOther infamous examples include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered to challenge the government's authoritarian rule. Official reports claimed 200-300 deaths, but the Chinese Red Cross estimated between 2,000-3,000 fatalities. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups and the Rwandan government systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates, is another stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power. The atrocities committed during Hitler's \"Third Reich\" are a chilling example of the devastating consequences of unchecked power and hatred.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz comes largely from his remarkable career span and his remarkable ability to mold his orchestra. Although Ellington's piano playing is understated in many of the compositions featured in this selection, he was a master composer who excelled at crafting intricate and complex pieces that highlighted the individual talents of his band members. By creating a framework that allowed soloists to freely improvise, as well as writing tightly orchestrated sections and phrases that showcased the unique style of each player, Ellington brought out the best in his musicians. This approach not only emphasized the unique sound of the orchestra as a whole but also created coherent and original sounds to match each piece. Ellington's deep understanding of the individual players' sound and how they blended together to form a cohesive ensemble allowed him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's innovative use of the human voice as a 'jazz instrument' throughout his career, citing Creole Love Call as an early example. This slow, deliberate 12-bar blues piece is a great demonstration of Ellington's ability to incorporate voice without lyrics, adding texture and color to his music. Creole Love Call consists of six choruses, each showcasing a different musical element:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response sequence between voice and reeds, with the voice beginning smooth and melodic before becoming rougher towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the main melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band reprises the first chorus, with a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, featuring the reeds taking the lead in a high register, backed by syncopated stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this final chorus, the voice adopts the 'growl' technique, soloing as an instrument.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add dimension to his music is a recurring theme throughout his work. In Hot and Bothered, recorded a year after Creole Love Call, Ellington combines his skill at intricate orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound, blending the vocal elements of Miley's playing and instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) further develops these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "She had always felt a nagging void within her, a yearning that never seemed to be satiated. This sensation had been present since she was 14, as she navigated the complexities of adolescence. Three years later, at 17, the feeling remained, and she had come to the realization that she was searching for a connection with someone, rather than just a material thing. However, she found herself lacking any interest in the boys around her, who would often try to win her over with awkward attempts to woo her. She frequently questioned herself about this peculiar phenomenon, trying to pinpoint the source of her detachment. The years of contemplation led to various theories, but none that she found convincing enough to solidify her thoughts.\n\nIn her everyday life, her home was typically a peaceful haven, thanks to her calm and gentle parents. They rarely argued with each other, and their daughter was no exception, with them only occasionally disagreeing about her strong sense of independence and free-spirited nature. Her parents' tranquil energy was balanced by her outgoing and lively personality, making her a likable and affectionate person.\n\nOn this particular day, however, her peaceful existence was disrupted. As she moved from room to room, searching for inspiration, she heard a faint scream from the kitchen, followed by her mother's distressed voice. She rushed into the room, her heart racing, and frantically asked, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" Upon entering, she saw her mother lying on the ground, wincing in pain, and repeatedly saying \"Ow\" in short gasps. She quickly dropped to her side, placing a hand on her mother's shoulder to offer assistance. \"Ouch... swee-ty, I... need you to take me to... the hospital,\" her mother stammered, her words urgent and strained. The daughter quickly sprang into action, \"Okay Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\" Her mother gave her directions, and at that moment, the daughter was grateful for her previous self-defense classes, which had honed her physical strength. She carefully carried her mother to the car, settled her in the backseat, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought a wave of disinfectant and sickness smells, mixed with an undercurrent of fear. But the daughter's mind was focused solely on helping her mother, and she wasn't aware of the anxiety surrounding her. She quickly ushered her mother into the emergency room, called for medical assistance, and watched as worried faces gathered around. A doctor soon arrived and quickly assessed her mother's condition, while the daughter was left to anxiously wait.\n\nHer mother had slipped off a stepping stool while trying to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet in their home.",
            "This study aimed to investigate the relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean Diet, as reflected by a high alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality. The aMed diet is a modified version of the traditional Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes higher consumption of plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol intake is also allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that following a Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, and an intervention study found that it was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering cholesterol levels in obese individuals. However, there was a lack of research focusing specifically on the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThe study followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort study of over 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) that assessed nutrient intake over the past year. A remarkable 95% of participants continued to participate throughout the study period. The FFQs were validated through various studies, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by medical records, autopsy, or death certificates. In cases where records were not available, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nTo account for individual variations and better represent long-term dietary habits, the researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs (averaging scores from two prior years). They also adjusted for potential confounding factors, such as age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study used Cox proportional-hazard modeling to examine the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and non-fatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nThe results showed that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of developing CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, there were 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States plunged into a severe economic downturn. High unemployment rates, a collapsed housing market, and the downfall of many major corporations left the country reeling. This ongoing recession prompts a critical question: what led to this crisis, and how can we prevent it from happening again? Simply put, the financial crisis was the direct result of reckless and uninformed decision-making by politicians who forced banks and companies to issue sub-prime loans to a fragile financial system. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured into packaging these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks found themselves short on capital reserves and transferred the chaos to the repackaged mortgages they had sold and the rest of the economy.\n\nThe seeds of the financial crisis were sown in 1999 during the Clinton era, as President Clinton sought to secure a second term in office. To boost his popularity, he relaxed lending restrictions, setting the stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later. In 1999, Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, faced pressure from the Clinton Administration to make more loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers and pressure from shareholders to maintain its high profits.\" Holmes astutely predicted the consequences of these actions: \"But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, thoughtless lending ultimately led to the economic collapse.\n\nA combination of factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years leading up to the crisis, intertwining more sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets becoming heavily over-leveraged in the housing market, making them extremely vulnerable to even minor changes in price. Eventually, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for about 30% of the U.S. GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a discount, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subject to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt and were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "The infamous exposition - that dreaded part of your story where you're tempted to take a deep breath, stretch your writing wings, and show off your impressive vocabulary.  However, this is often the section where readers start losing interest and reach for the \"Back\" button, muttering a few choice words under their breath.  Even seasoned writers like Dr. Merlin have been known to let out a frustrated sigh when they find themselves bogged down in too much background information.\n\nExposition can be a sneaky foe, especially when it takes the form of a lengthy narrative that fails to move the plot forward.  We've all heard the advice \"Show, don't tell,\" but it's easy to fall into the trap of info-dumping, where you feel compelled to share every detail about your characters' pasts, no matter how minor.  This can be especially true when you're trying to get the history out of the way so you can get to the good stuff.\n\nIn writing, exposition is essentially telling the audience what happened, often in a straightforward and predictable manner.  Think of it as the verbal equivalent of a Wikipedia summary.  In film, it's often the scene where one character spews out a long, drawn-out monologue about someone's backstory.  As authors, we're guilty of doing the same thing when we fail to integrate our exposition into the fabric of the story.\n\nTo illustrate the point, imagine a scene where the heroine is telling a friend about her husband.  You're told that they met at a certain time and place, got married in a grand ceremony, and were together until his tragic death.  You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to take up two pages, with barely any dialogue between the two of them.  Instead, you'd want to see the husband's character shine through in his interactions with the heroine, giving you insight into their relationship and his impact on her life.  By doing so, you'd become emotionally invested in his fate and grow closer to the heroine as a character.\n\nIn short, you need to add substance to the bare bones of your story.  It's tempting to rush past certain details, especially when introducing new characters or backstories.  You might know that your character used to be in the Air Force, is the night manager of a gas station, and has a secret dream of owning the business someday.  However, instead of dumping all this information at once, try to weave it into the narrative in a more organic way.",
            "I recently watched two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, which raised some disturbing concerns. The first one I watched was from NBC 4 on August 13, 2011. The lead story was about a violent incident involving a man named Shad Hostettler, who allegedly stabbed his wife in Ashley, Ohio. Although the news didn't reveal her name, they did show a mug shot of the suspect, which was quite unsettling. The story was covered in about two minutes, which I think was sufficient given the developing nature of the case.\n\nThe next story I watched was about an 18-year-old man named Travis Buyers, who was shot in the Sharon Woods area. Unfortunately, he was critically injured, and no arrests had been made at the time. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime, but I felt that this story was glossed over a bit too quickly. It's a pattern I've noticed for years: the media tends to downplay crimes involving minorities. If a white person is a victim, the media goes into overdrive, but when it's a minority, it's often ignored or barely mentioned.\n\nThe news broadcast then moved on to a story about a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. The investigation revealed that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.\n\nThe next story was about the predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon. They mentioned that temperatures would remain in the mid-to-low 80s over the weekend, and this was presented as a \"teaser\" to keep viewers tuned in.\n\nOne story that stood out to me was about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned black man wearing a hoodie sweatshirt, around 6 feet tall, and weighing around 150 pounds. What struck me as unusual was the emphasis on his skin tone and the fact that they repeatedly mentioned he was black. It seemed excessive.\n\nThe final story I watched was about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin who was sentenced to prison for conspiring to distribute large amounts of marijuana to Ohio. What caught my attention was the way the news reported his sentence – instead of saying 25 years, they said \"300 months.\" I'm not sure what the reasoning was behind this, but it seemed like they were trying to make the sentence sound harsher. They also mentioned that he was a Hispanic man, but I'm not sure how relevant that was to the story.",
            "A bond between brothers is a unique and powerful thing - unbreakable and irrevocable. This bond encompasses a wide range of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers have a deep understanding of one another, one that goes beyond any other relationship. When staring into the eyes of their brother, they can see their own reflection staring back. It's in the most critical moments that the true nature of this bond is revealed, whether it's good or bad. The consequences that come with these emotions can be far-reaching, and a key part of understanding the complex emotions born of this fraternal link is learning to live with those consequences. When one can gaze into their brother's eyes and see their own true self staring back, they gain a profound insight into their own character. This is evident through the actions they take and the consequences that follow. \n\nIn the story \"The Scarlet Ibis\", two brothers embark on a journey that delves into this theme and the intense emotions that come with it. Against a backdrop of a vivid, lush landscape, these two boys set out on a doomed path. The conflict between bitter disappointment and intense pride reaches a boiling point in the climactic scene, leaving only one brother alive. The author illustrates this theme through the direct characterization of the protagonist, as well as the interactions between the two brothers and the narrator's perspective, which conveys the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his perception of the world around him. These influences greatly impact his actions. \n\nThe protagonist's actions can be summed up by one dominant emotion: pride. From the moment he and his younger brother, Doodle, set out together, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He had hoped for a brother who could accompany him in all his endeavors, learning from him and sharing in his experiences, like holding his breath, running, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp. He envisioned a brother who could join him on his adventures, like racing to Horsehead Landing and perching with him in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. Unfortunately, these aspirations are impossible, given Doodle's fragile health. Born with a severely weakened heart, it was highly unlikely that Doodle would survive, let alone participate in physically demanding activities. The protagonist's disappointment is palpable as his dreams are crushed in an instant. He even entertains the thought of suffocating Doodle with a pillow, showcasing the depth of his frustration. However, his anger melts away when Doodle smiles at him, revealing a glimmer of hope. This fleeting moment suggests that his conviction was not as strong as he thought. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "In the realm of brain science, a critical topic is the human brain - an intricate, creative information-processing system. Over time, as technology has evolved from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain have also undergone significant changes. In the past, the brain was likened to a wax tablet, then a sheet of papyrus, followed by a book, and most recently, a computer. As you delve deeper into the brain, it's essential to remember that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and may lead to misconceptions.\n\nThe process of information processing begins with sensory organs transforming physical stimuli, such as touch, heat, sound waves, or light, into electrochemical signals. This sensory information undergoes repeated transformations through the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down processing. To illustrate this, consider viewing a picture of a black box on a white background. Bottom-up processing combines basic information like color, orientation, and object borders to recognize the box. Top-down processing, on the other hand, uses the decisions made at earlier steps to speed up your recognition of the box, possibly identifying it as a black box or a box-shaped hole in the background.\n\nWhen information has been processed to some extent, an attention filter determines its importance and decides which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For instance, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name even in a noisy room. There are numerous stages of processing, and the results are repeatedly modulated by attention.\n\nFor the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded. Different types of encoding are specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to its visual appearance, phonemically, referring to its sound, or semantically, referring to its meaning. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained through an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models explaining how knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on how human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Many critics have argued that Aldous Huxley's novel Brave New World is a scathing critique of the dangers of emerging technologies and the capitalist systems that fuel them. Huxley's dystopian society is a stark contrast to our own, where people prioritize community above individuality and are conditioned from birth to pursue instant gratification. The citizens are little more than pawns in a larger game, trapped in a world where they are forced to conform to a single ideology imposed by the World Controller. When viewed through the lens of Marxist theory, it becomes clear that Huxley's work is a commentary on the darker aspects of the capitalist systems of his time. The novel is riddled with Marxist terminology, such as homogeny and reification, which reinforce the idea that Huxley was warning against the dangers of emerging economic systems. \n\nOne of the primary targets of Huxley's satire is the concept of false consciousness, a key tenet of Marxist theory. In Brave New World, the common citizenry is kept in the dark about the true nature of the economy and their place within it, focused instead on their own personal gain. This is achieved through the use of hypnopædia, which conditions people to prioritize consumption and indulgence above all else. The World Controller manipulates this desire, using hegemony to dominate the lower classes and keep them in line. The lower classes, represented by characters such as the Deltas and Gammas, are unaware of the manipulation, literally \"buying into\" an ideology that supports the status quo. Meanwhile, the upper classes, like the Alphas and Betas, are aware of the system but do little to challenge it. The novel's portrayal of relationships between characters, or rather the lack thereof, is also telling. Interactions are shallow and lacking in depth, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism has drained individuals of their free will and emotional expression. Even romantic relationships are reduced to superficial comments about physical appearance, further highlighting the dehumanizing effects of the capitalist system. The complacency of each social class in their place within the hierarchy is a testament to the Marxist concept of the proletariat, who are led to believe they are superior as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform.",
            "As a student at University Park for nearly three years, I've come to realize that navigating the campus can be a hassle. My freshman year, I lived in East Halls, which is essentially the farthest east point on campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Getting from my dorm in Stuart Hall to classes in buildings like Willard, located near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially during bad weather, which is a regular occurrence in State College. I recently spoke to an alum who's not much older than me, and they shared that not too long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated from the rest of the university by large tracts of unused land. However, this empty space has since been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounded by apartments. As the campus continues to expand, traveling from one place to another becomes increasingly challenging. In my opinion, the most effective solution to this problem is the bicycle. However, it's not just about owning a bike; students need to use them regularly, and the campus needs to be designed with the needs of bicyclists in mind.\n\nOne of my friends recently took up cycling again after a few years of not riding. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped, saying, \"Bikes are great – for a few years, it wasn't cool to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Not only is cycling beneficial for your health, but it's also the most efficient mode of transportation. A bowl of oatmeal and some physical activity can take you 30 miles or more. As a student living off-campus, I now face similar challenges getting to class. I have to travel to Thomas building, which is just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. Buying a bike was the smartest decision I made this year, as it can cut down on walking time significantly. However, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas, isn't always the easiest road to navigate by bike. While walking has its benefits, I'm too busy to walk, and without my bike, it would be my only reliable option, taking an extra 30-40 minutes each way, which is over two and a half hours per week. This is time I simply can't spare."
